was

queer
handkerchief
mockingly
embellished
with
all
the
gay
flags
of
all
the

of

he
loved
to
dust
his
old

it
somehow
mildly
reminded
him
of
his
mortality
“while

by
what
name
a

it
will
be
seen
that
this
mere
painstaking
burrower
and
grub-worm
of
a
poor
devil
of
a
sub-sub
appears
to
have
gone
through
the
long
vaticans
and
street-stalls
of
the
earth
picking
up
whatever
random
allusions
to
whales
he
could
anyways
find
in
any
book
whatsoever
sacred
or
profane
therefore
you
must
not
in
every
case
at
least
take
the
higgledy-piggledy
whale
statements
however
authentic
in
these
extracts
for
veritable
gospel
cetology
far
from
it
as
touching
the
ancient
authors
generally
as
well
as
the
poets

valuable

affording

of
leviathan

thee

sallow
tribe
which
no
wine
of
this
world

ever
warm

for
whom
even
pale
sherry
would
be
too
rosy-strong
but
with
whom
one
sometimes
loves
to
sit
and
feel
poor-devilish
too
and
grow
convivial
upon
tears
and
say
to
them
bluntly
with
full
eyes
and
empty
glasses

in
not
altogether
unpleasant
sadness—give

ye

out

ye

gulp
down
your

aloft

be
plunged
in
his
deepest
reveries—stand
that
man
on
his
legs
set
his
feet
a-going
and
he
will
infallibly
lead
you
to
water
if
water
there
be
in
all
that
region
should
you
ever
be
athirst
in
the
great
american
desert
try
this
experiment
if
your
caravan
happen
to
be
supplied
with
a
metaphysical
professor
yes
as
every
one
knows
meditation
and
water
are
wedded
for
ever
but
here
is
an
artist
he
desires
to
paint
you
the
dreamiest
shadiest
quietest
most
enchanting
bit
of
romantic
landscape
in
all
the
valley
of
the
saco
what
is
the
chief
element
he
employs
there
stand
his
trees
each
with
a
hollow
trunk
as
if
a
hermit
and
a
crucifix
were
within
and
here
sleeps
his
meadow
and
there
sleep
his
cattle
and
up
from
yonder
cottage
goes
a
sleepy
smoke
deep
into
distant
woodlands
winds
a
mazy
way
reaching
to
overlapping
spurs
of
mountains
bathed
in
their
hill-side
blue
but
though
the
picture
lies
thus
tranced
and
though
this
pine-tree
shakes
down
its
sighs
like
leaves
upon
this
shepherd’s
head
yet
all
were
vain
unless
the
shepherd’s
eye
were
fixed
upon
the
magic
stream
before
him
go
visit
the
prairies
in
june
when
for
scores
on
scores
of
miles
you
wade
knee-deep
among
tiger-lilies—what
is
the
one
charm
wanting?—water—there
is
not
a
drop
of
water
there
were
niagara
but
a
cataract
of
sand
would
you
travel
your
thousand
miles
to
see
it
why
did
the
poor
poet
of
tennessee
upon
suddenly
receiving
two
handfuls
of
silver
deliberate
whether
to
buy
him
a
coat
which
he
sadly
needed
or
invest
his
money
in
a
pedestrian
trip
to
rockaway
beach
why
is
almost
every
robust
healthy
boy
with
a
robust
healthy
soul
in
him
at
some
time
or
other
crazy
to
go
to
sea
why
upon
your
first
voyage
as
a
passenger
did
you
yourself
feel
such
a
mystical
vibration
when
first
told
that
you
and
your
ship
were
now
out
of
sight
of
land
why
did
the
old
persians
hold
the
sea
holy
why
did
the
greeks
give
it
a
separate
deity
and
own
brother
of
jove
surely
all
this
is
not
without
meaning
and
still
deeper
the
meaning
of
that
story
of
narcissus
who
because
he
could
not
grasp
the
tormenting
mild
image
he
saw
in
the
fountain
plunged
into
it
and
was
drowned
but
that
same
image
we
ourselves
see
in
all
rivers
and
oceans
it
is
the
image
of
the
ungraspable
phantom
of
life
and
this
is
the
key
to
it
all
now
when
i
say
that
i
am
in
the
habit
of
going
to
sea
whenever
i
begin
to
grow
hazy
about
the
eyes
and
begin
to
be
over
conscious
of
my
lungs
i
do
not
mean
to
have
it
inferred
that
i
ever
go
to
sea
as
a
passenger
for
to
go
as
a
passenger
you
must
needs
have
a
purse
and
a
purse
is
but
a
rag
unless
you
have
something
in
it
besides
passengers
get
sea-sick—grow
quarrelsome—don’t
sleep
of
nights—do
not
enjoy
themselves
much
as
a
general
thing;—no
i
never
go
as
a
passenger
nor
though
i
am
something
of
a
salt
do
i
ever
go
to
sea
as
a
commodore
or
a
captain
or
a
cook
i
abandon
the
glory
and
distinction
of
such
offices
to
those
who
like
them
for
my
part
i
abominate
all
honorable
respectable
toils
trials
and
tribulations
of
every
kind
whatsoever
it
is
quite
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
take
care
of
myself
without
taking
care
of
ships
barques
brigs
schooners
and
what
not
and
as
for
going
as
cook,—though
i
confess
there
is
considerable
glory
in
that
a
cook
being
a
sort
of
officer
on
ship-board—yet
somehow
i
never
fancied
broiling
fowls;—though
once
broiled
judiciously
buttered
and
judgmatically
salted
and
peppered
there
is
no
one
who
will
speak
more
respectfully
not
to
say
reverentially
of
a
broiled
fowl
than
i
will
it
is
out
of
the
idolatrous
dotings
of
the
old
egyptians
upon
broiled
ibis
and
roasted
river
horse
that
you
see
the
mummies
of
those
creatures
in
their
huge
bake-houses
the
pyramids
no
when
i
go
to
sea
i
go
as
a
simple
sailor
right
before
the
mast
plumb
down
into
the
forecastle
aloft
there
to
the
royal
mast-head
true
they
rather
order
me
about
some
and
make
me
jump
from
spar
to
spar
like
a
grasshopper
in
a
may
meadow
and
at
first
this
sort
of
thing
is
unpleasant
enough
it
touches
one’s
sense
of
honor
particularly
if
you
come
of
an
old
established
family
in
the
land
the
van
rensselaers
or
randolphs
or
hardicanutes
and
more
than
all
if
just
previous
to
putting
your
hand
into
the
tar-pot
you
have
been
lording
it
as
a
country
schoolmaster
making
the
tallest
boys
stand
in
awe
of
you
the
transition
is
a
keen
one
i
assure
you
from
a
schoolmaster
to
a
sailor
and
requires
a
strong
decoction
of
seneca
and
the
stoics
to
enable
you
to
grin
and
bear
it
but
even
this
wears
off
in
time
what
of
it
if
some
old
hunks
of
a
sea-captain
orders
me
to
get
a
broom
and
sweep
down
the
decks
what
does
that
indignity
amount
to
weighed
i
mean
in
the
scales
of
the
new
testament
do
you
think
the
archangel
gabriel
thinks
anything
the
less
of
me
because
i
promptly
and
respectfully
obey
that
old
hunks
in
that
particular
instance
who
ain’t
a
slave
tell
me
that
well
then
however
the
old
sea-captains
may
order
me
about—however
they
may
thump
and
punch
me
about
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
it
is
all
right
that
everybody
else
is
one
way
or
other
served
in
much
the
same
way—either
in
a
physical
or
metaphysical
point
of
view
that
is
and
so
the
universal
thump
is
passed
round
and
all
hands
should
rub
each
other’s
shoulder-blades
and
be
content
again
i
always
go
to
sea
as
a
sailor
because
they
make
a
point
of
paying
me
for
my
trouble
whereas
they
never
pay
passengers
a
single
penny
that
i
ever
heard
of
on
the
contrary
passengers
themselves
must
pay
and
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
paying
and
being
paid
the
act
of
paying
is
perhaps
the
most
uncomfortable
infliction
that
the
two
orchard
thieves
entailed
upon
us
but
_being
paid_,—what
will
compare
with
it
the
urbane
activity
with
which
a
man
receives
money
is
really
marvellous
considering
that
we
so
earnestly
believe
money
to
be
the
root
of
all
earthly
ills
and
that
on
no
account
can
a
monied
man
enter
heaven
ah
how
cheerfully
we
consign
ourselves
to
perdition
finally
i
always
go
to
sea
as
a
sailor
because
of
the
wholesome
exercise
and
pure
air
of
the
fore-castle
deck
for
as
in
this
world
head
winds
are
far
more
prevalent
than
winds
from
astern
that
is
if
you
never
violate
the
pythagorean
maxim
so
for
the
most
part
the
commodore
on
the
quarter-deck
gets
his
atmosphere
at
second
hand
from
the
sailors
on
the
forecastle
he
thinks
he
breathes
it
first
but
not
so
in
much
the
same
way
do
the
commonalty
lead
their
leaders
in
many
other
things
at
the
same
time
that
the
leaders
little
suspect
it
but
wherefore
it
was
that
after
having
repeatedly
smelt
the
sea
as
a
merchant
sailor
i
should
now
take
it
into
my
head
to
go
on
a
whaling
voyage
this
the
invisible
police
officer
of
the
fates
who
has
the
constant
surveillance
of
me
and
secretly
dogs
me
and
influences
me
in
some
unaccountable
way—he
can
better
answer
than
any
one
else
and
doubtless
my
going
on
this
whaling
voyage
formed
part
of
the
grand
programme
of
providence
that
was
drawn
up
a
long
time
ago
it
came
in
as
a
sort
of
brief
interlude
and
solo
between
more
extensive
performances
i
take
it
that
this
part
of
the
bill
must
have
run
something
like
this
“_grand
contested
election
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states._
“whaling
voyage
by
one
ishmael
“bloody
battle
in
affghanistan.”
though
i
cannot
tell
why
it
was
exactly
that
those
stage
managers
the
fates
put
me
down
for
this
shabby
part
of
a
whaling
voyage
when
others
were
set
down
for
magnificent
parts
in
high
tragedies
and
short
and
easy
parts
in
genteel
comedies
and
jolly
parts
in
farces—though
i
cannot
tell
why
this
was
exactly
yet
now
that
i
recall
all
the
circumstances
i
think
i
can
see
a
little
into
the
springs
and
motives
which
being
cunningly
presented
to
me
under
various
disguises
induced
me
to
set
about
performing
the
part
i
did
besides
cajoling
me
into
the
delusion
that
it
was
a
choice
resulting
from
my
own
unbiased
freewill
and
discriminating
judgment
chief
among
these
motives
was
the
overwhelming
idea
of
the
great
whale
himself
such
a
portentous
and
mysterious
monster
roused
all
my
curiosity
then
the
wild
and
distant
seas
where
he
rolled
his
island
bulk
the
undeliverable
nameless
perils
of
the
whale
these
with
all
the
attending
marvels
of
a
thousand
patagonian
sights
and
sounds
helped
to
sway
me
to
my
wish
with
other
men
perhaps
such
things
would
not
have
been
inducements
but
as
for
me
i
am
tormented
with
an
everlasting
itch
for
things
remote
i
love
to
sail
forbidden
seas
and
land
on
barbarous
coasts
not
ignoring
what
is
good
i
am
quick
to
perceive
a
horror
and
could
still
be
social
with
it—would
they
let
me—since
it
is
but
well
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
all
the
inmates
of
the
place
one
lodges
in
by
reason
of
these
things
then
the
whaling
voyage
was
welcome
the
great
flood-gates
of
the
wonder-world
swung
open
and
in
the
wild
conceits
that
swayed
me
to
my
purpose
two
and
two
there
floated
into
my
inmost
soul
endless
processions
of
the
whale
and
mid
most
of
them
all
one
grand
hooded
phantom
like
a
snow
hill
in
the
air
chapter
2
the
carpet-bag
i
stuffed
a
shirt
or
two
into
my
old
carpet-bag
tucked
it
under
my
arm
and
started
for
cape
horn
and
the
pacific
quitting
the
good
city
of
old
manhatto
i
duly
arrived
in
new
bedford
it
was
a
saturday
night
in
december
much
was
i
disappointed
upon
learning
that
the
little
packet
for
nantucket
had
already
sailed
and
that
no
way
of
reaching
that
place
would
offer
till
the
following
monday
as
most
young
candidates
for
the
pains
and
penalties
of
whaling
stop
at
this
same
new
bedford
thence
to
embark
on
their
voyage
it
may
as
well
be
related
that
i
for
one
had
no
idea
of
so
doing
for
my
mind
was
made
up
to
sail
in
no
other
than
a
nantucket
craft
because
there
was
a
fine
boisterous
something
about
everything
connected
with
that
famous
old
island
which
amazingly
pleased
me
besides
though
new
bedford
has
of
late
been
gradually
monopolising
the
business
of
whaling
and
though
in
this
matter
poor
old
nantucket
is
now
much
behind
her
yet
nantucket
was
her
great
original—the
tyre
of
this
carthage;—the
place
where
the
first
dead
american
whale
was
stranded
where
else
but
from
nantucket
did
those
aboriginal
whalemen
the
red-men
first
sally
out
in
canoes
to
give
chase
to
the
leviathan
and
where
but
from
nantucket
too
did
that
first
adventurous
little
sloop
put
forth
partly
laden
with
imported
cobblestones—so
goes
the
story—to
throw
at
the
whales
in
order
to
discover
when
they
were
nigh
enough
to
risk
a
harpoon
from
the
bowsprit
now
having
a
night
a
day
and
still
another
night
following
before
me
in
new
bedford
ere
i
could
embark
for
my
destined
port
it
became
a
matter
of
concernment
where
i
was
to
eat
and
sleep
meanwhile
it
was
a
very
dubious-looking
nay
a
very
dark
and
dismal
night
bitingly
cold
and
cheerless
i
knew
no
one
in
the
place
with
anxious
grapnels
i
had
sounded
my
pocket
and
only
brought
up
a
few
pieces
of
silver,—so
wherever
you
go
ishmael
said
i
to
myself
as
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
dreary
street
shouldering
my
bag
and
comparing
the
gloom
towards
the
north
with
the
darkness
towards
the
south—wherever
in
your
wisdom
you
may
conclude
to
lodge
for
the
night
my
dear
ishmael
be
sure
to
inquire
the
price
and
don’t
be
too
particular
with
halting
steps
i
paced
the
streets
and
passed
the
sign
of
“the
crossed
harpoons”—but
it
looked
too
expensive
and
jolly
there
further
on
from
the
bright
red
windows
of
the
“sword-fish
inn,”
there
came
such
fervent
rays
that
it
seemed
to
have
melted
the
packed
snow
and
ice
from
before
the
house
for
everywhere
else
the
congealed
frost
lay
ten
inches
thick
in
a
hard
asphaltic
pavement,—rather
weary
for
me
when
i
struck
my
foot
against
the
flinty
projections
because
from
hard
remorseless
service
the
soles
of
my
boots
were
in
a
most
miserable
plight
too
expensive
and
jolly
again
thought
i
pausing
one
moment
to
watch
the
broad
glare
in
the
street
and
hear
the
sounds
of
the
tinkling
glasses
within
but
go
on
ishmael
said
i
at
last
don’t
you
hear
get
away
from
before
the
door
your
patched
boots
are
stopping
the
way
so
on
i
went
i
now
by
instinct
followed
the
streets
that
took
me
waterward
for
there
doubtless
were
the
cheapest
if
not
the
cheeriest
inns
such
dreary
streets
blocks
of
blackness
not
houses
on
either
hand
and
here
and
there
a
candle
like
a
candle
moving
about
in
a
tomb
at
this
hour
of
the
night
of
the
last
day
of
the
week
that
quarter
of
the
town
proved
all
but
deserted
but
presently
i
came
to
a
smoky
light
proceeding
from
a
low
wide
building
the
door
of
which
stood
invitingly
open
it
had
a
careless
look
as
if
it
were
meant
for
the
uses
of
the
public
so
entering
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
stumble
over
an
ash-box
in
the
porch
ha
thought
i
ha
as
the
flying
particles
almost
choked
me
are
these
ashes
from
that
destroyed
city
gomorrah
but
“the
crossed
harpoons,”
and
“the
sword-fish?”—this
then
must
needs
be
the
sign
of
“the
trap.”
however
i
picked
myself
up
and
hearing
a
loud
voice
within
pushed
on
and
opened
a
second
interior
door
it
seemed
the
great
black
parliament
sitting
in
tophet
a
hundred
black
faces
turned
round
in
their
rows
to
peer
and
beyond
a
black
angel
of
doom
was
beating
a
book
in
a
pulpit
it
was
a
negro
church
and
the
preacher’s
text
was
about
the
blackness
of
darkness
and
the
weeping
and
wailing
and
teeth-gnashing
there
ha
ishmael
muttered
i
backing
out
wretched
entertainment
at
the
sign
of
‘the
trap!’
moving
on
i
at
last
came
to
a
dim
sort
of
light
not
far
from
the
docks
and
heard
a
forlorn
creaking
in
the
air
and
looking
up
saw
a
swinging
sign
over
the
door
with
a
white
painting
upon
it
faintly
representing
a
tall
straight
jet
of
misty
spray
and
these
words
underneath—“the
spouter
inn:—peter
coffin.”
coffin?—spouter?—rather
ominous
in
that
particular
connexion
thought
i
but
it
is
a
common
name
in
nantucket
they
say
and
i
suppose
this
peter
here
is
an
emigrant
from
there
as
the
light
looked
so
dim
and
the
place
for
the
time
looked
quiet
enough
and
the
dilapidated
little
wooden
house
itself
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
carted
here
from
the
ruins
of
some
burnt
district
and
as
the
swinging
sign
had
a
poverty-stricken
sort
of
creak
to
it
i
thought
that
here
was
the
very
spot
for
cheap
lodgings
and
the
best
of
pea
coffee
it
was
a
queer
sort
of
place—a
gable-ended
old
house
one
side
palsied
as
it

leaning
over

it

on

bleak
corner

up

howling

did

“in
judging
of
that
tempestuous
wind
called
euroclydon,”
says
an
old
writer—of
whose
works
i
possess
the
only
copy
extant—“it
maketh
a
marvellous
difference
whether
thou
lookest
out
at
it
from
a
glass
window
where
the
frost
is
all
on
the
outside
or
whether
thou
observest
it
from
that
sashless
window
where
the
frost
is
on
both
sides
and
of
which
the
wight
death
is
the
only
glazier.”
true
enough
thought
i
as
this
passage
occurred
to
my
mind—old
black-letter
thou
reasonest
well
yes
these

are

this

of
mine

a

didn’t
stop
up
the
chinks

crannies

it’s
too
late
to
make
any

now
the

is
finished
the

poor

there
chattering
his

against
the

for

shaking
off
his

with
his

he
might
plug
up
both
ears
with

chapter
3
the
spouter-inn
entering
that
gable-ended
spouter-inn
you
found
yourself
in
a
wide
low
straggling
entry
with
old-fashioned
wainscots
reminding
one
of
the
bulwarks
of
some
condemned
old
craft
on
one
side
hung
a
very
large
oilpainting
so
thoroughly
besmoked
and
every
way
defaced
that
in
the
unequal
crosslights
by
which
you
viewed
it
it
was
only
by
diligent
study
and
a
series
of
systematic
visits
to
it
and
careful
inquiry
of
the
neighbors
that
you
could
any
way
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
its
purpose
such
unaccountable
masses
of
shades
and
shadows
that
at
first
you
almost
thought
some
ambitious
young
artist
in
the
time
of
the
new
england
hags
had
endeavored
to
delineate
chaos
bewitched
but
by
dint
of
much
and
earnest
contemplation
and
oft
repeated
ponderings
and
especially
by
throwing
open
the
little
window
towards
the
back
of
the
entry
you
at
last
come
to
the
conclusion
that
such
an
idea
however
wild
might
not
be
altogether
unwarranted
but
what
most
puzzled
and
confounded
you
was
a
long
limber
portentous
black
mass
of
something
hovering
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
over
three
blue
dim
perpendicular
lines
floating
in
a
nameless
yeast
a
boggy
soggy
squitchy
picture
truly
enough
to
drive
a
nervous
man
distracted
yet
was
there
a
sort
of
indefinite
half-attained
unimaginable
sublimity
about
it
that
fairly
froze
you
to
it
till
you
involuntarily
took
an
oath
with
yourself
to
find
out
what
that
marvellous
painting
meant
ever
and
anon
a
bright
but
alas
deceptive
idea
would
dart
you
through.—it’s
the
black
sea
in
a
midnight
gale.—it’s
the
unnatural
combat
of
the
four
primal
elements.—it’s
a
blasted
heath.—it’s
a
hyperborean
winter
scene.—it’s
the
breaking-up
of
the
icebound
stream
of
time
but
at
last
all
these
fancies
yielded
to
that
one
portentous
something
in
the
picture’s
midst
_that_
once
found
out
and
all
the
rest
were
plain
but
stop
does
it
not
bear
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
gigantic
fish
even
the
great
leviathan
himself
in
fact
the
artist’s
design
seemed
this
a
final
theory
of
my
own
partly
based
upon
the
aggregated
opinions
of
many
aged
persons
with
whom
i
conversed
upon
the
subject
the
picture
represents
a
cape-horner
in
a
great
hurricane
the
half-foundered
ship
weltering
there
with
its
three
dismantled
masts
alone
visible
and
an
exasperated
whale
purposing
to
spring
clean
over
the
craft
is
in
the
enormous
act
of
impaling
himself
upon
the
three
mast-heads
the
opposite
wall
of
this
entry
was
hung
all
over
with
a
heathenish
array
of
monstrous
clubs
and
spears
some
were
thickly
set
with
glittering
teeth
resembling
ivory
saws
others
were
tufted
with
knots
of
human
hair
and
one
was
sickle-shaped
with
a
vast
handle
sweeping
round
like
the
segment
made
in
the
new-mown
grass
by
a
long-armed
mower
you
shuddered
as
you
gazed
and
wondered
what
monstrous
cannibal
and
savage
could
ever
have
gone
a
death-harvesting
with
such
a
hacking
horrifying
implement
mixed
with
these
were
rusty
old
whaling
lances
and
harpoons
all
broken
and
deformed
some
were
storied
weapons
with
this
once
long
lance
now
wildly
elbowed
fifty
years
ago
did
nathan
swain
kill
fifteen
whales
between
a
sunrise
and
a
sunset
and
that
harpoon—so
like
a
corkscrew
now—was
flung
in
javan
seas
and
run
away
with
by
a
whale
years
afterwards
slain
off
the
cape
of
blanco
the
original
iron
entered
nigh
the
tail
and
like
a
restless
needle
sojourning
in
the
body
of
a
man
travelled
full
forty
feet
and
at
last
was
found
imbedded
in
the
hump
crossing
this
dusky
entry
and
on
through
yon
low-arched
way—cut
through
what
in
old
times
must
have
been
a
great
central
chimney
with
fireplaces
all
round—you
enter
the
public
room
a
still
duskier
place
is
this
with
such
low
ponderous
beams
above
and
such
old
wrinkled
planks
beneath
that
you
would
almost
fancy
you
trod
some
old
craft’s
cockpits
especially
of
such
a
howling
night
when
this
corner-anchored
old
ark
rocked
so
furiously
on
one
side
stood
a
long
low
shelf-like
table
covered
with
cracked
glass
cases
filled
with
dusty
rarities
gathered
from
this
wide
world’s
remotest
nooks
projecting
from
the
further
angle
of
the
room
stands
a
dark-looking
den—the
bar—a
rude
attempt
at
a
right
whale’s
head
be
that
how
it
may
there
stands
the
vast
arched
bone
of
the
whale’s
jaw
so
wide
a
coach
might
almost
drive
beneath
it
within
are
shabby
shelves
ranged
round
with
old
decanters
bottles
flasks
and
in
those
jaws
of
swift
destruction
like
another
cursed
jonah
by
which
name
indeed
they
called
him
bustles
a
little
withered
old
man
who
for
their
money
dearly
sells
the
sailors
deliriums
and
death
abominable
are
the
tumblers
into
which
he
pours
his
poison
though
true
cylinders
without—within
the
villanous
green
goggling
glasses
deceitfully
tapered
downwards
to
a
cheating
bottom
parallel
meridians
rudely
pecked
into
the
glass
surround
these
footpads’
goblets
fill
to
_this_
mark
and
your
charge
is
but
a
penny
to
_this_
a
penny
more
and
so
on
to
the
full
glass—the
cape
horn
measure
which
you
may
gulp
down
for
a
shilling
upon
entering
the
place
i
found
a
number
of
young
seamen
gathered
about
a
table
examining
by
a
dim
light
divers
specimens
of
_skrimshander_
i
sought
the
landlord
and
telling
him
i
desired
to
be
accommodated
with
a
room
received
for
answer
that
his
house
was
full—not
a
bed
unoccupied
“but
avast,”
he
added
tapping
his
forehead
“you
haint
no
objections
to
sharing
a
harpooneer’s
blanket
have
ye
i
s’pose
you
are
goin’
a-whalin’
so
you’d
better
get
used
to
that
sort
of
thing.”
i
told
him
that
i
never
liked
to
sleep
two
in
a
bed
that
if
i
should
ever
do
so
it
would
depend
upon
who
the
harpooneer
might
be
and
that
if
he
the
landlord
really
had
no
other
place
for
me
and
the
harpooneer
was
not
decidedly
objectionable
why
rather
than
wander
further
about
a
strange
town
on
so
bitter
a
night
i
would
put
up
with
the
half
of
any
decent
man’s
blanket
“i
thought
so
all
right
take
a
seat
supper?—you
want
supper
supper’ll
be
ready
directly.”
i
sat
down
on
an
old
wooden
settle
carved
all
over
like
a
bench
on
the
battery
at
one
end
a
ruminating
tar
was
still
further
adorning
it
with
his
jack-knife
stooping
over
and
diligently
working
away
at
the
space
between
his
legs
he
was
trying
his
hand
at
a
ship
under
full
sail
but
he
didn’t
make
much
headway
i
thought
at
last
some
four
or
five
of
us
were
summoned
to
our
meal
in
an
adjoining
room
it
was
cold
as
iceland—no
fire
at
all—the
landlord
said
he
couldn’t
afford
it
nothing
but
two
dismal
tallow
candles
each
in
a
winding
sheet
we
were
fain
to
button
up
our
monkey
jackets
and
hold
to
our
lips
cups
of
scalding
tea
with
our
half
frozen
fingers
but
the
fare
was
of
the
most
substantial
kind—not
only
meat
and
potatoes
but
dumplings
good
heavens
dumplings
for
supper
one
young
fellow
in
a
green
box
coat
addressed
himself
to
these
dumplings
in
a
most
direful
manner
“my
boy,”
said
the
landlord
“you’ll
have
the
nightmare
to
a
dead
sartainty.”
“landlord,”
i
whispered
“that
aint
the
harpooneer
is
it?”
“oh
no,”
said
he
looking
a
sort
of
diabolically
funny
“the
harpooneer
is
a
dark
complexioned
chap
he
never
eats
dumplings
he
don’t—he
eats
nothing
but
steaks
and
he
likes
’em
rare.”
“the
devil
he
does,”
says
i
“where
is
that
harpooneer
is
he
here?”
“he’ll
be
here
afore
long,”
was
the
answer
i
could
not
help
it
but
i
began
to
feel
suspicious
of
this
“dark
complexioned”
harpooneer
at
any
rate
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
it
so
turned
out
that
we
should
sleep
together
he
must
undress
and
get
into
bed
before
i
did
supper
over
the
company
went
back
to
the
bar-room
when
knowing
not
what
else
to
do
with
myself
i
resolved
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
as
a
looker
on
presently
a
rioting
noise
was
heard
without
starting
up
the
landlord
cried
“that’s
the
grampus’s
crew
i
seed
her
reported
in
the
offing
this
morning
a
three
years’
voyage
and
a
full
ship
hurrah
boys
now
we’ll
have
the
latest
news
from
the
feegees.”
a
tramping
of
sea
boots
was
heard
in
the
entry
the
door
was
flung
open
and
in
rolled
a
wild
set
of
mariners
enough
enveloped
in
their
shaggy
watch
coats
and
with
their
heads
muffled
in
woollen
comforters
all
bedarned
and
ragged
and
their
beards
stiff
with
icicles
they
seemed
an
eruption
of
bears
from
labrador
they
had
just
landed
from
their
boat
and
this
was
the
first
house
they
entered
no
wonder
then
that
they
made
a
straight
wake
for
the
whale’s
mouth—the
bar—when
the
wrinkled
little
old
jonah
there
officiating
soon
poured
them
out
brimmers
all
round
one
complained
of
a
bad
cold
in
his
head
upon
which
jonah
mixed
him
a
pitch-like
potion
of
gin
and
molasses
which
he
swore
was
a
sovereign
cure
for
all
colds
and
catarrhs
whatsoever
never
mind
of
how
long
standing
or
whether
caught
off
the
coast
of
labrador
or
on
the
weather
side
of
an
ice-island
the
liquor
soon
mounted
into
their
heads
as
it
generally
does
even
with
the
arrantest
topers
newly
landed
from
sea
and
they
began
capering
about
most
obstreperously
i
observed
however
that
one
of
them
held
somewhat
aloof
and
though
he
seemed
desirous
not
to
spoil
the
hilarity
of
his
shipmates
by
his
own
sober
face
yet
upon
the
whole
he
refrained
from
making
as
much
noise
as
the
rest
this
man
interested
me
at
once
and
since
the
sea-gods
had
ordained
that
he
should
soon
become
my
shipmate
though
but
a
sleeping-partner
one
so
far
as
this
narrative
is
concerned
i
will
here
venture
upon
a
little
description
of
him
he
stood
full
six
feet
in
height
with
noble
shoulders
and
a
chest
like
a
coffer-dam
i
have
seldom
seen
such
brawn
in
a
man
his
face
was
deeply
brown
and
burnt
making
his
white
teeth
dazzling
by
the
contrast
while
in
the
deep
shadows
of
his
eyes
floated
some
reminiscences
that
did
not
seem
to
give
him
much
joy
his
voice
at
once
announced
that
he
was
a
southerner
and
from
his
fine
stature
i
thought
he
must
be
one
of
those
tall
mountaineers
from
the
alleghanian
ridge
in
virginia
when
the
revelry
of
his
companions
had
mounted
to
its
height
this
man
slipped
away
unobserved
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
till
he
became
my
comrade
on
the
sea
in
a
few
minutes
however
he
was
missed
by
his
shipmates
and
being
it
seems
for
some
reason
a
huge
favourite
with
them
they
raised
a
cry
of
“bulkington
bulkington
where’s
bulkington?”
and
darted
out
of
the
house
in
pursuit
of
him
it
was
now
about
nine
o’clock
and
the
room
seeming
almost
supernaturally
quiet
after
these
orgies
i
began
to
congratulate
myself
upon
a
little
plan
that
had
occurred
to
me
just
previous
to
the
entrance
of
the
seamen
no
man
prefers
to
sleep
two
in
a
bed
in
fact
you
would
a
good
deal
rather
not
sleep
with
your
own
brother
i
don’t
know
how
it
is
but
people
like
to
be
private
when
they
are
sleeping
and
when
it
comes
to
sleeping
with
an
unknown
stranger
in
a
strange
inn
in
a
strange
town
and
that
stranger
a
harpooneer
then
your
objections
indefinitely
multiply
nor
was
there
any
earthly
reason
why
i
as
a
sailor
should
sleep
two
in
a
bed
more
than
anybody
else
for
sailors
no
more
sleep
two
in
a
bed
at
sea
than
bachelor
kings
do
ashore
to
be
sure
they
all
sleep
together
in
one
apartment
but
you
have
your
own
hammock
and
cover
yourself
with
your
own
blanket
and
sleep
in
your
own
skin
the
more
i
pondered
over
this
harpooneer
the
more
i
abominated
the
thought
of
sleeping
with
him
it
was
fair
to
presume
that
being
a
harpooneer
his
linen
or
woollen
as
the
case
might
be
would
not
be
of
the
tidiest
certainly
none
of
the
finest
i
began
to
twitch
all
over
besides
it
was
getting
late
and
my
decent
harpooneer
ought
to
be
home
and
going
bedwards
suppose
now
he
should
tumble
in
upon
me
at
midnight—how
could
i
tell
from
what
vile
hole
he
had
been
coming
“landlord
i’ve
changed
my
mind
about
that
harpooneer.—i
shan’t
sleep
with
him
i’ll
try
the
bench
here.”
“just
as
you
please
i’m
sorry
i
can’t
spare
ye
a
tablecloth
for
a
mattress
and
it’s
a
plaguy
rough
board
here”—feeling
of
the
knots
and
notches
“but
wait
a
bit
skrimshander
i’ve
got
a
carpenter’s
plane
there
in
the
bar—wait
i
say
and
i’ll
make
ye
snug
enough.”
so
saying
he
procured
the
plane
and
with
his
old
silk
handkerchief
first
dusting
the
bench
vigorously
set
to
planing
away
at
my
bed
the
while
grinning
like
an
ape
the
shavings
flew
right
and
left
till
at
last
the
plane-iron
came
bump
against
an
indestructible
knot
the
landlord
was
near
spraining
his
wrist
and
i
told
him
for
heaven’s
sake
to
quit—the
bed
was
soft
enough
to
suit
me
and
i
did
not
know
how
all
the
planing
in
the
world
could
make
eider
down
of
a
pine
plank
so
gathering
up
the
shavings
with
another
grin
and
throwing
them
into
the
great
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
went
about
his
business
and
left
me
in
a
brown
study
i
now
took
the
measure
of
the
bench
and
found
that
it
was
a
foot
too
short
but
that
could
be
mended
with
a
chair
but
it
was
a
foot
too
narrow
and
the
other
bench
in
the
room
was
about
four
inches
higher
than
the
planed
one—so
there
was
no
yoking
them
i
then
placed
the
first
bench
lengthwise
along
the
only
clear
space
against
the
wall
leaving
a
little
interval
between
for
my
back
to
settle
down
in
but
i
soon
found
that
there
came
such
a
draught
of
cold
air
over
me
from
under
the
sill
of
the
window
that
this
plan
would
never
do
at
all
especially
as
another
current
from
the
rickety
door
met
the
one
from
the
window
and
both
together
formed
a
series
of
small
whirlwinds
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
spot
where
i
had
thought
to
spend
the
night
the
devil
fetch
that
harpooneer
thought
i
but
stop
couldn’t
i
steal
a
march
on
him—bolt
his
door
inside
and
jump
into
his
bed
not
to
be
wakened
by
the
most
violent
knockings
it
seemed
no
bad
idea
but
upon
second
thoughts
i
dismissed
it
for
who
could
tell
but
what
the
next
morning
so
soon
as
i
popped
out
of
the
room
the
harpooneer
might
be
standing
in
the
entry
all
ready
to
knock
me
down
still
looking
round
me
again
and
seeing
no
possible
chance
of
spending
a
sufferable
night
unless
in
some
other
person’s
bed
i
began
to
think
that
after
all
i
might
be
cherishing
unwarrantable
prejudices
against
this
unknown
harpooneer
thinks
i
i’ll
wait
awhile
he
must
be
dropping
in
before
long
i’ll
have
a
good
look
at
him
then
and
perhaps
we
may
become
jolly
good
bedfellows
after
all—there’s
no
telling
but
though
the
other
boarders
kept
coming
in
by
ones
twos
and
threes
and
going
to
bed
yet
no
sign
of
my
harpooneer
“landlord!”
said
i
“what
sort
of
a
chap
is
he—does
he
always
keep
such
late
hours?”
it
was
now
hard
upon
twelve
o’clock
the
landlord
chuckled
again
with
his
lean
chuckle
and
seemed
to
be
mightily
tickled
at
something
beyond
my
comprehension
“no,”
he
answered
“generally
he’s
an
early
bird—airley
to
bed
and
airley
to
rise—yes
he’s
the
bird
what
catches
the
worm
but
to-night
he
went
out
a
peddling
you
see
and
i
don’t
see
what
on
airth
keeps
him
so
late
unless
may
be
he
can’t
sell
his
head.”
“can’t
sell
his
head?—what
sort
of
a
bamboozingly
story
is
this
you
are
telling
me?”
getting
into
a
towering
rage
“do
you
pretend
to
say
landlord
that
this
harpooneer
is
actually
engaged
this
blessed
saturday
night
or
rather
sunday
morning
in
peddling
his
head
around
this
town?”
“that’s
precisely
it,”
said
the
landlord
“and
i
told
him
he
couldn’t
sell
it
here
the
market’s
overstocked.”
“with
what?”
shouted
i
“with
heads
to
be
sure
ain’t
there
too
many
heads
in
the
world?”
“i
tell
you
what
it
is
landlord,”
said
i
quite
calmly
“you’d
better
stop
spinning
that
yarn
to
me—i’m
not
green.”
“may
be
not,”
taking
out
a
stick
and
whittling
a
toothpick
“but
i
rayther
guess
you’ll
be
done
_brown_
if
that
ere
harpooneer
hears
you
a
slanderin’
his
head.”
“i’ll
break
it
for
him,”
said
i
now
flying
into
a
passion
again
at
this
unaccountable
farrago
of
the
landlord’s
“it’s
broke
a’ready,”
said
he
“broke,”
said
i—“_broke_
do
you
mean?”
“sartain
and
that’s
the
very
reason
he
can’t
sell
it
i
guess.”
“landlord,”
said
i
going
up
to
him
as
cool
as
mt
hecla
in
a
snow-storm—“landlord
stop
whittling
you
and
i
must
understand
one
another
and
that
too
without
delay
i
come
to
your
house
and
want
a
bed
you
tell
me
you
can
only
give
me
half
a
one
that
the
other
half
belongs
to
a
certain
harpooneer
and
about
this
harpooneer
whom
i
have
not
yet
seen
you
persist
in
telling
me
the
most
mystifying
and
exasperating
stories
tending
to
beget
in
me
an
uncomfortable
feeling
towards
the
man
whom
you
design
for
my
bedfellow—a
sort
of
connexion
landlord
which
is
an
intimate
and
confidential
one
in
the
highest
degree
i
now
demand
of
you
to
speak
out
and
tell
me
who
and
what
this
harpooneer
is
and
whether
i
shall
be
in
all
respects
safe
to
spend
the
night
with
him
and
in
the
first
place
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
unsay
that
story
about
selling
his
head
which
if
true
i
take
to
be
good
evidence
that
this
harpooneer
is
stark
mad
and
i’ve
no
idea
of
sleeping
with
a
madman
and
you
sir
_you_
i
mean
landlord
_you_
sir
by
trying
to
induce
me
to
do
so
knowingly
would
thereby
render
yourself
liable
to
a
criminal
prosecution.”
“wall,”
said
the
landlord
fetching
a
long
breath
“that’s
a
purty
long
sarmon
for
a
chap
that
rips
a
little
now
and
then
but
be
easy
be
easy
this
here
harpooneer
i
have
been
tellin’
you
of
has
just
arrived
from
the
south
seas
where
he
bought
up
a
lot
of
’balmed
new
zealand
heads
great
curios
you
know
and
he’s
sold
all
on
’em
but
one
and
that
one
he’s
trying
to
sell
to-night
cause
to-morrow’s
sunday
and
it
would
not
do
to
be
sellin’
human
heads
about
the
streets
when
folks
is
goin’
to
churches
he
wanted
to
last
sunday
but
i
stopped
him
just
as
he
was
goin’
out
of
the
door
with
four
heads
strung
on
a
string
for
all
the
airth
like
a
string
of
inions.”
this
account
cleared
up
the
otherwise
unaccountable
mystery
and
showed
that
the
landlord
after
all
had
had
no
idea
of
fooling
me—but
at
the
same
time
what
could
i
think
of
a
harpooneer
who
stayed
out
of
a
saturday
night
clean
into
the
holy
sabbath
engaged
in
such
a
cannibal
business
as
selling
the
heads
of
dead
idolators
“depend
upon
it
landlord
that
harpooneer
is
a
dangerous
man.”
“he
pays
reg’lar,”
was
the
rejoinder
“but
come
it’s
getting
dreadful
late
you
had
better
be
turning
flukes—it’s
a
nice
bed
sal
and
me
slept
in
that
ere
bed
the
night
we
were
spliced
there’s
plenty
of
room
for
two
to
kick
about
in
that
bed
it’s
an
almighty
big
bed
that
why
afore
we
give
it
up
sal
used
to
put
our
sam
and
little
johnny
in
the
foot
of
it
but
i
got
a
dreaming
and
sprawling
about
one
night
and
somehow
sam
got
pitched
on
the
floor
and
came
near
breaking
his
arm
arter
that
sal
said
it
wouldn’t
do
come
along
here
i’ll
give
ye
a
glim
in
a
jiffy;”
and
so
saying
he
lighted
a
candle
and
held
it
towards
me
offering
to
lead
the
way
but
i
stood
irresolute
when
looking
at
a
clock
in
the
corner
he
exclaimed
“i
vum
it’s
sunday—you
won’t
see
that
harpooneer
to-night
he’s
come
to
anchor
somewhere—come
along
then
_do_
come
_won’t_
ye
come?”
i
considered
the
matter
a
moment
and
then
up
stairs
we
went
and
i
was
ushered
into
a
small
room
cold
as
a
clam
and
furnished
sure
enough
with
a
prodigious
bed
almost
big
enough
indeed
for
any
four
harpooneers
to
sleep
abreast
“there,”
said
the
landlord
placing
the
candle
on
a
crazy
old
sea
chest
that
did
double
duty
as
a
wash-stand
and
centre
table
“there
make
yourself
comfortable
now
and
good
night
to
ye.”
i
turned
round
from
eyeing
the
bed
but
he
had
disappeared
folding
back
the
counterpane
i
stooped
over
the
bed
though
none
of
the
most
elegant
it
yet
stood
the
scrutiny
tolerably
well
i
then
glanced
round
the
room
and
besides
the
bedstead
and
centre
table
could
see
no
other
furniture
belonging
to
the
place
but
a
rude
shelf
the
four
walls
and
a
papered
fireboard
representing
a
man
striking
a
whale
of
things
not
properly
belonging
to
the
room
there
was
a
hammock
lashed
up
and
thrown
upon
the
floor
in
one
corner
also
a
large
seaman’s
bag
containing
the
harpooneer’s
wardrobe
no
doubt
in
lieu
of
a
land
trunk
likewise
there
was
a
parcel
of
outlandish
bone
fish
hooks
on
the
shelf
over
the
fire-place
and
a
tall
harpoon
standing
at
the
head
of
the
bed
but
what
is
this
on
the
chest
i
took
it
up
and
held
it
close
to
the
light
and
felt
it
and
smelt
it
and
tried
every
way
possible
to
arrive
at
some
satisfactory
conclusion
concerning
it
i
can
compare
it
to
nothing
but
a
large
door
mat
ornamented
at
the
edges
with
little
tinkling
tags
something
like
the
stained
porcupine
quills
round
an
indian
moccasin
there
was
a
hole
or
slit
in
the
middle
of
this
mat
as
you
see
the
same
in
south
american
ponchos
but
could
it
be
possible
that
any
sober
harpooneer
would
get
into
a
door
mat
and
parade
the
streets
of
any
christian
town
in
that
sort
of
guise
i
put
it
on
to
try
it
and
it
weighed
me
down
like
a
hamper
being
uncommonly
shaggy
and
thick
and
i
thought
a
little
damp
as
though
this
mysterious
harpooneer
had
been
wearing
it
of
a
rainy
day
i
went
up
in
it
to
a
bit
of
glass
stuck
against
the
wall
and
i
never
saw
such
a
sight
in
my
life
i
tore
myself
out
of
it
in
such
a
hurry
that
i
gave
myself
a
kink
in
the
neck
i
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
commenced
thinking
about
this
head-peddling
harpooneer
and
his
door
mat
after
thinking
some
time
on
the
bed-side
i
got
up
and
took
off
my
monkey
jacket
and
then
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
thinking
i
then
took
off
my
coat
and
thought
a
little
more
in
my
shirt
sleeves
but
beginning
to
feel
very
cold
now
half
undressed
as
i
was
and
remembering
what
the
landlord
said
about
the
harpooneer’s
not
coming
home
at
all
that
night
it
being
so
very
late
i
made
no
more
ado
but
jumped
out
of
my
pantaloons
and
boots
and
then
blowing
out
the
light
tumbled
into
bed
and
commended
myself
to
the
care
of
heaven
whether
that
mattress
was
stuffed
with
corn-cobs
or
broken
crockery
there
is
no
telling
but
i
rolled
about
a
good
deal
and
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
at
last
i
slid
off
into
a
light
doze
and
had
pretty
nearly
made
a
good
offing
towards
the
land
of
nod
when
i
heard
a
heavy
footfall
in
the
passage
and
saw
a
glimmer
of
light
come
into
the
room
from
under
the
door
lord
save
me
thinks
i
that
must
be
the
harpooneer
the
infernal
head-peddler
but
i
lay
perfectly
still
and
resolved
not
to
say
a
word
till
spoken
to
holding
a
light
in
one
hand
and
that
identical
new
zealand
head
in
the
other
the
stranger
entered
the
room
and
without
looking
towards
the
bed
placed
his
candle
a
good
way
off
from
me
on
the
floor
in
one
corner
and
then
began
working
away
at
the
knotted
cords
of
the
large
bag
i
before
spoke
of
as
being
in
the
room
i
was
all
eagerness
to
see
his
face
but
he
kept
it
averted
for
some
time
while
employed
in
unlacing
the
bag’s
mouth
this
accomplished
however
he
turned
round—when
good
heavens
what
a
sight
such
a
face
it
was
of
a
dark
purplish
yellow
colour
here
and
there
stuck
over
with
large
blackish
looking
squares
yes
it’s
just
as
i
thought
he’s
a
terrible
bedfellow
he’s
been
in
a
fight
got
dreadfully
cut
and
here
he
is
just
from
the
surgeon
but
at
that
moment
he
chanced
to
turn
his
face
so
towards
the
light
that
i
plainly
saw
they
could
not
be
sticking-plasters
at
all
those
black
squares
on
his
cheeks
they
were
stains
of
some
sort
or
other
at
first
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
this
but
soon
an
inkling
of
the
truth
occurred
to
me
i
remembered
a
story
of
a
white
man—a
whaleman
too—who
falling
among
the
cannibals
had
been
tattooed
by
them
i
concluded
that
this
harpooneer
in
the
course
of
his
distant
voyages
must
have
met
with
a
similar
adventure
and
what
is
it
thought
i
after
all
it’s
only
his
outside
a
man
can
be
honest
in
any
sort
of
skin
but
then
what
to
make
of
his
unearthly
complexion
that
part
of
it
i
mean
lying
round
about
and
completely
independent
of
the
squares
of
tattooing
to
be
sure
it
might
be
nothing
but
a
good
coat
of
tropical
tanning
but
i
never
heard
of
a
hot
sun’s
tanning
a
white
man
into
a
purplish
yellow
one
however
i
had
never
been
in
the
south
seas
and
perhaps
the
sun
there
produced
these
extraordinary
effects
upon
the
skin
now
while
all
these
ideas
were
passing
through
me
like
lightning
this
harpooneer
never
noticed
me
at
all
but
after
some
difficulty
having
opened
his
bag
he
commenced
fumbling
in
it
and
presently
pulled
out
a
sort
of
tomahawk
and
a
seal-skin
wallet
with
the
hair
on
placing
these
on
the
old
chest
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
then
took
the
new
zealand
head—a
ghastly
thing
enough—and
crammed
it
down
into
the
bag
he
now
took
off
his
hat—a
new
beaver
hat—when
i
came
nigh
singing
out
with
fresh
surprise
there
was
no
hair
on
his
head—none
to
speak
of
at
least—nothing
but
a
small
scalp-knot
twisted
up
on
his
forehead
his
bald
purplish
head
now
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
mildewed
skull
had
not
the
stranger
stood
between
me
and
the
door
i
would
have
bolted
out
of
it
quicker
than
ever
i
bolted
a
dinner
even
as
it
was
i
thought
something
of
slipping
out
of
the
window
but
it
was
the
second
floor
back
i
am
no
coward
but
what
to
make
of
this
head-peddling
purple
rascal
altogether
passed
my
comprehension
ignorance
is
the
parent
of
fear
and
being
completely
nonplussed
and
confounded
about
the
stranger
i
confess
i
was
now
as
much
afraid
of
him
as
if
it
was
the
devil
himself
who
had
thus
broken
into
my
room
at
the
dead
of
night
in
fact
i
was
so
afraid
of
him
that
i
was
not
game
enough
just
then
to
address
him
and
demand
a
satisfactory
answer
concerning
what
seemed
inexplicable
in
him
meanwhile
he
continued
the
business
of
undressing
and
at
last
showed
his
chest
and
arms
as
i
live
these
covered
parts
of
him
were
checkered
with
the
same
squares
as
his
face
his
back
too
was
all
over
the
same
dark
squares
he
seemed
to
have
been
in
a
thirty
years’
war
and
just
escaped
from
it
with
a
sticking-plaster
shirt
still
more
his
very
legs
were
marked
as
if
a
parcel
of
dark
green
frogs
were
running
up
the
trunks
of
young
palms
it
was
now
quite
plain
that
he
must
be
some
abominable
savage
or
other
shipped
aboard
of
a
whaleman
in
the
south
seas
and
so
landed
in
this
christian
country
i
quaked
to
think
of
it
a
peddler
of
heads
too—perhaps
the
heads
of
his
own
brothers
he
might
take
a
fancy
to
mine—heavens
look
at
that
tomahawk
but
there
was
no
time
for
shuddering
for
now
the
savage
went
about
something
that
completely
fascinated
my
attention
and
convinced
me
that
he
must
indeed
be
a
heathen
going
to
his
heavy
grego
or
wrapall
or
dreadnaught
which
he
had
previously
hung
on
a
chair
he
fumbled
in
the
pockets
and
produced
at
length
a
curious
little
deformed
image
with
a
hunch
on
its
back
and
exactly
the
colour
of
a
three
days’
old
congo
baby
remembering
the
embalmed
head
at
first
i
almost
thought
that
this
black
manikin
was
a
real
baby
preserved
in
some
similar
manner
but
seeing
that
it
was
not
at
all
limber
and
that
it
glistened
a
good
deal
like
polished
ebony
i
concluded
that
it
must
be
nothing
but
a
wooden
idol
which
indeed
it
proved
to
be
for
now
the
savage
goes
up
to
the
empty
fire-place
and
removing
the
papered
fire-board
sets
up
this
little
hunch-backed
image
like
a
tenpin
between
the
andirons
the
chimney
jambs
and
all
the
bricks
inside
were
very
sooty
so
that
i
thought
this
fire-place
made
a
very
appropriate
little
shrine
or
chapel
for
his
congo
idol
i
now
screwed
my
eyes
hard
towards
the
half
hidden
image
feeling
but
ill
at
ease
meantime—to
see
what
was
next
to
follow
first
he
takes
about
a
double
handful
of
shavings
out
of
his
grego
pocket
and
places
them
carefully
before
the
idol
then
laying
a
bit
of
ship
biscuit
on
top
and
applying
the
flame
from
the
lamp
he
kindled
the
shavings
into
a
sacrificial
blaze
presently
after
many
hasty
snatches
into
the
fire
and
still
hastier
withdrawals
of
his
fingers
whereby
he
seemed
to
be
scorching
them
badly
he
at
last
succeeded
in
drawing
out
the
biscuit
then
blowing
off
the
heat
and
ashes
a
little
he
made
a
polite
offer
of
it
to
the
little
negro
but
the
little
devil
did
not
seem
to
fancy
such
dry
sort
of
fare
at
all
he
never
moved
his
lips
all
these
strange
antics
were
accompanied
by
still
stranger
guttural
noises
from
the
devotee
who
seemed
to
be
praying
in
a
sing-song
or
else
singing
some
pagan
psalmody
or
other
during
which
his
face
twitched
about
in
the
most
unnatural
manner
at
last
extinguishing
the
fire
he
took
the
idol
up
very
unceremoniously
and
bagged
it
again
in
his
grego
pocket
as
carelessly
as
if
he
were
a
sportsman
bagging
a
dead
woodcock
all
these
queer
proceedings
increased
my
uncomfortableness
and
seeing
him
now
exhibiting
strong
symptoms
of
concluding
his
business
operations
and
jumping
into
bed
with
me
i
thought
it
was
high
time
now
or
never
before
the
light
was
put
out
to
break
the
spell
in
which
i
had
so
long
been
bound
but
the
interval
i
spent
in
deliberating
what
to
say
was
a
fatal
one
taking
up
his
tomahawk
from
the
table
he
examined
the
head
of
it
for
an
instant
and
then
holding
it
to
the
light
with
his
mouth
at
the
handle
he
puffed
out
great
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
the
next
moment
the
light
was
extinguished
and
this
wild
cannibal
tomahawk
between
his
teeth
sprang
into
bed
with
me
i
sang
out
i
could
not
help
it
now
and
giving
a
sudden
grunt
of
astonishment
he
began
feeling
me
stammering
out
something
i
knew
not
what
i
rolled
away
from
him
against
the
wall
and
then
conjured
him
whoever
or
whatever
he
might
be
to
keep
quiet
and
let
me
get
up
and
light
the
lamp
again
but
his
guttural
responses
satisfied
me
at
once
that
he
but
ill
comprehended
my
meaning
“who-e
debel
you?”—he
at
last
said—“you
no
speak-e
dam-me
i
kill-e.”
and
so
saying
the
lighted
tomahawk
began
flourishing
about
me
in
the
dark
“landlord
for
god’s
sake
peter
coffin!”
shouted
i
“landlord
watch
coffin
angels
save
me!”
“speak-e
tell-ee
me
who-ee
be
or
dam-me
i
kill-e!”
again
growled
the
cannibal
while
his
horrid
flourishings
of
the
tomahawk
scattered
the
hot
tobacco
ashes
about
me
till
i
thought
my
linen
would
get
on
fire
but
thank
heaven
at
that
moment
the
landlord
came
into
the
room
light
in
hand
and
leaping
from
the
bed
i
ran
up
to
him
“don’t
be
afraid
now,”
said
he
grinning
again
“queequeg
here
wouldn’t
harm
a
hair
of
your
head.”
“stop
your
grinning,”
shouted
i
“and
why
didn’t
you
tell
me
that
that
infernal
harpooneer
was
a
cannibal?”
“i
thought
ye
know’d
it;—didn’t
i
tell
ye
he
was
a
peddlin’
heads
around
town?—but
turn
flukes
again
and
go
to
sleep
queequeg
look
here—you
sabbee
me
i
sabbee—you
this
man
sleepe
you—you
sabbee?”
“me
sabbee
plenty”—grunted
queequeg
puffing
away
at
his
pipe
and
sitting
up
in
bed
“you
gettee
in,”
he
added
motioning
to
me
with
his
tomahawk
and
throwing
the
clothes
to
one
side
he
really
did
this
in
not
only
a
civil
but
a
really
kind
and
charitable
way
i
stood
looking
at
him
a
moment
for
all
his
tattooings
he
was
on
the
whole
a
clean
comely
looking
cannibal
what’s
all
this
fuss
i
have
been
making
about
thought
i
to
myself—the
man’s
a
human
being
just
as
i
am
he
has
just
as
much
reason
to
fear
me
as
i
have
to
be
afraid
of
him
better
sleep
with
a
sober
cannibal
than
a
drunken
christian
“landlord,”
said
i
“tell
him
to
stash
his
tomahawk
there
or
pipe
or
whatever
you
call
it
tell
him
to
stop
smoking
in
short
and
i
will
turn
in
with
him
but
i
don’t
fancy
having
a
man
smoking
in
bed
with
me
it’s
dangerous
besides
i
ain’t
insured.”
this
being
told
to
queequeg
he
at
once
complied
and
again
politely
motioned
me
to
get
into
bed—rolling
over
to
one
side
as
much
as
to
say—“i
won’t
touch
a
leg
of
ye.”
“good
night
landlord,”
said
i
“you
may
go.”
i
turned
in
and
never
slept
better
in
my
life
chapter
4
the
counterpane
upon
waking
next
morning
about
daylight
i
found
queequeg’s
arm
thrown
over
me
in
the
most
loving
and
affectionate
manner
you
had
almost
thought
i
had
been
his
wife
the
counterpane
was
of
patchwork
full
of
odd
little
parti-coloured
squares
and
triangles
and
this
arm
of
his
tattooed
all
over
with
an
interminable
cretan
labyrinth
of
a
figure
no
two
parts
of
which
were
of
one
precise
shade—owing
i
suppose
to
his
keeping
his
arm
at
sea
unmethodically
in
sun
and
shade
his
shirt
sleeves
irregularly
rolled
up
at
various
times—this
same
arm
of
his
i
say
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
strip
of
that
same
patchwork
quilt
indeed
partly
lying
on
it
as
the
arm
did
when
i
first
awoke
i
could
hardly
tell
it
from
the
quilt
they
so
blended
their
hues
together
and
it
was
only
by
the
sense
of
weight
and
pressure
that
i
could
tell
that
queequeg
was
hugging
me
my
sensations
were
strange
let
me
try
to
explain
them
when
i
was
a
child
i
well
remember
a
somewhat
similar
circumstance
that
befell
me
whether
it
was
a
reality
or
a
dream
i
never
could
entirely
settle
the
circumstance
was
this
i
had
been
cutting
up
some
caper
or
other—i
think
it
was
trying
to
crawl
up
the
chimney
as
i
had
seen
a
little
sweep
do
a
few
days
previous
and
my
stepmother
who
somehow
or
other
was
all
the
time
whipping
me
or
sending
me
to
bed
supperless,—my
mother
dragged
me
by
the
legs
out
of
the
chimney
and
packed
me
off
to
bed
though
it
was
only
two
o’clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
21st
june
the
longest
day
in
the
year
in
our
hemisphere
i
felt
dreadfully
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
up
stairs
i
went
to
my
little
room
in
the
third
floor
undressed
myself
as
slowly
as
possible
so
as
to
kill
time
and
with
a
bitter
sigh
got
between
the
sheets
i
lay
there
dismally
calculating
that
sixteen
entire
hours
must
elapse
before
i
could
hope
for
a
resurrection
sixteen
hours
in
bed
the
small
of
my
back
ached
to
think
of
it
and
it
was
so
light
too
the
sun
shining
in
at
the
window
and
a
great
rattling
of
coaches
in
the
streets
and
the
sound
of
gay
voices
all
over
the
house
i
felt
worse
and
worse—at
last
i
got
up
dressed
and
softly
going
down
in
my
stockinged
feet
sought
out
my
stepmother
and
suddenly
threw
myself
at
her
feet
beseeching
her
as
a
particular
favour
to
give
me
a
good
slippering
for
my
misbehaviour
anything
indeed
but
condemning
me
to
lie
abed
such
an
unendurable
length
of
time
but
she
was
the
best
and
most
conscientious
of
stepmothers
and
back
i
had
to
go
to
my
room
for
several
hours
i
lay
there
broad
awake
feeling
a
great
deal
worse
than
i
have
ever
done
since
even
from
the
greatest
subsequent
misfortunes
at
last
i
must
have
fallen
into
a
troubled
nightmare
of
a
doze
and
slowly
waking
from
it—half
steeped
in
dreams—i
opened
my
eyes
and
the
before
sun-lit
room
was
now
wrapped
in
outer
darkness
instantly
i
felt
a
shock
running
through
all
my
frame
nothing
was
to
be
seen
and
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
a
supernatural
hand
seemed
placed
in
mine
my
arm
hung
over
the
counterpane
and
the
nameless
unimaginable
silent
form
or
phantom
to
which
the
hand
belonged
seemed
closely
seated
by
my
bed-side
for
what
seemed
ages
piled
on
ages
i
lay
there
frozen
with
the
most
awful
fears
not
daring
to
drag
away
my
hand
yet
ever
thinking
that
if
i
could
but
stir
it
one
single
inch
the
horrid
spell
would
be
broken
i
knew
not
how
this
consciousness
at
last
glided
away
from
me
but
waking
in
the
morning
i
shudderingly
remembered
it
all
and
for
days
and
weeks
and
months
afterwards
i
lost
myself
in
confounding
attempts
to
explain
the
mystery
nay
to
this
very
hour
i
often
puzzle
myself
with
it
now
take
away
the
awful
fear
and
my
sensations
at
feeling
the
supernatural
hand
in
mine
were
very
similar
in
their
strangeness
to
those
which
i
experienced
on
waking
up
and
seeing
queequeg’s
pagan
arm
thrown
round
me
but
at
length
all
the
past
night’s
events
soberly
recurred
one
by
one
in
fixed
reality
and
then
i
lay
only
alive
to
the
comical
predicament
for
though
i
tried
to
move
his
arm—unlock
his
bridegroom
clasp—yet
sleeping
as
he
was
he
still
hugged
me
tightly
as
though
naught
but
death
should
part
us
twain
i
now
strove
to
rouse
him—“queequeg!”—but
his
only
answer
was
a
snore
i
then
rolled
over
my
neck
feeling
as
if
it
were
in
a
horse-collar
and
suddenly
felt
a
slight
scratch
throwing
aside
the
counterpane
there
lay
the
tomahawk
sleeping
by
the
savage’s
side
as
if
it
were
a
hatchet-faced
baby
a
pretty
pickle
truly
thought
i
abed
here
in
a
strange
house
in
the
broad
day
with
a
cannibal
and
a
tomahawk
“queequeg!—in
the
name
of
goodness
queequeg
wake!”
at
length
by
dint
of
much
wriggling
and
loud
and
incessant
expostulations
upon
the
unbecomingness
of
his
hugging
a
fellow
male
in
that
matrimonial
sort
of
style
i
succeeded
in
extracting
a
grunt
and
presently
he
drew
back
his
arm
shook
himself
all
over
like
a
newfoundland
dog
just
from
the
water
and
sat
up
in
bed
stiff
as
a
pike-staff
looking
at
me
and
rubbing
his
eyes
as
if
he
did
not
altogether
remember
how
i
came
to
be
there
though
a
dim
consciousness
of
knowing
something
about
me
seemed
slowly
dawning
over
him
meanwhile
i
lay
quietly
eyeing
him
having
no
serious
misgivings
now
and
bent
upon
narrowly
observing
so
curious
a
creature
when
at
last
his
mind
seemed
made
up
touching
the
character
of
his
bedfellow
and
he
became
as
it
were
reconciled
to
the
fact
he
jumped
out
upon
the
floor
and
by
certain
signs
and
sounds
gave
me
to
understand
that
if
it
pleased
me
he
would
dress
first
and
then
leave
me
to
dress
afterwards
leaving
the
whole
apartment
to
myself
thinks
i
queequeg
under
the
circumstances
this
is
a
very
civilized
overture
but
the
truth
is
these
savages
have
an
innate
sense
of
delicacy
say
what
you
will
it
is
marvellous
how
essentially
polite
they
are
i
pay
this
particular
compliment
to
queequeg
because
he
treated
me
with
so
much
civility
and
consideration
while
i
was
guilty
of
great
rudeness
staring
at
him
from
the
bed
and
watching
all
his
toilette
motions
for
the
time
my
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
my
breeding
nevertheless
a
man
like
queequeg
you
don’t
see
every
day
he
and
his
ways
were
well
worth
unusual
regarding
he
commenced
dressing
at
top
by
donning
his
beaver
hat
a
very
tall
one
by
the
by
and
then—still
minus
his
trowsers—he
hunted
up
his
boots
what
under
the
heavens
he
did
it
for
i
cannot
tell
but
his
next
movement
was
to
crush
himself—boots
in
hand
and
hat
on—under
the
bed
when
from
sundry
violent
gaspings
and
strainings
i
inferred
he
was
hard
at
work
booting
himself
though
by
no
law
of
propriety
that
i
ever
heard
of
is
any
man
required
to
be
private
when
putting
on
his
boots
but
queequeg
do
you
see
was
a
creature
in
the
transition
stage—neither
caterpillar
nor
butterfly
he
was
just
enough
civilized
to
show
off
his
outlandishness
in
the
strangest
possible
manners
his
education
was
not
yet
completed
he
was
an
undergraduate
if
he
had
not
been
a
small
degree
civilized
he
very
probably
would
not
have
troubled
himself
with
boots
at
all
but
then
if
he
had
not
been
still
a
savage
he
never
would
have
dreamt
of
getting
under
the
bed
to
put
them
on
at
last
he
emerged
with
his
hat
very
much
dented
and
crushed
down
over
his
eyes
and
began
creaking
and
limping
about
the
room
as
if
not
being
much
accustomed
to
boots
his
pair
of
damp
wrinkled
cowhide
ones—probably
not
made
to
order
either—rather
pinched
and
tormented
him
at
the
first
go
off
of
a
bitter
cold
morning
seeing
now
that
there
were
no
curtains
to
the
window
and
that
the
street
being
very
narrow
the
house
opposite
commanded
a
plain
view
into
the
room
and
observing
more
and
more
the
indecorous
figure
that
queequeg
made
staving
about
with
little
else
but
his
hat
and
boots
on
i
begged
him
as
well
as
i
could
to
accelerate
his
toilet
somewhat
and
particularly
to
get
into
his
pantaloons
as
soon
as
possible
he
complied
and
then
proceeded
to
wash
himself
at
that
time
in
the
morning
any
christian
would
have
washed
his
face
but
queequeg
to
my
amazement
contented
himself
with
restricting
his
ablutions
to
his
chest
arms
and
hands
he
then
donned
his
waistcoat
and
taking
up
a
piece
of
hard
soap
on
the
wash-stand
centre
table
dipped
it
into
water
and
commenced
lathering
his
face
i
was
watching
to
see
where
he
kept
his
razor
when
lo
and
behold
he
takes
the
harpoon
from
the
bed
corner
slips
out
the
long
wooden
stock
unsheathes
the
head
whets
it
a
little
on
his
boot
and
striding
up
to
the
bit
of
mirror
against
the
wall
begins
a
vigorous
scraping
or
rather
harpooning
of
his
cheeks
thinks
i
queequeg
this
is
using
rogers’s
best
cutlery
with
a
vengeance
afterwards
i
wondered
the
less
at
this
operation
when
i
came
to
know
of
what
fine
steel
the
head
of
a
harpoon
is
made
and
how
exceedingly
sharp
the
long
straight
edges
are
always
kept
the
rest
of
his
toilet
was
soon
achieved
and
he
proudly
marched
out
of
the
room
wrapped
up
in
his
great
pilot
monkey
jacket
and
sporting
his
harpoon
like
a
marshal’s
baton
chapter

breakfast
i
quickly
followed
suit
and
descending
into
the
bar-room
accosted
the
grinning
landlord
very
pleasantly
i
cherished
no
malice
towards
him
though
he
had
been
skylarking
with
me
not
a
little
in
the
matter
of
my
bedfellow
however
a
good
laugh
is
a
mighty
good
thing
and
rather
too
scarce
a
good
thing
the
more’s
the
pity
so
if
any
one
man
in
his
own
proper
person
afford
stuff
for
a
good
joke
to
anybody
let
him
not
be
backward
but
let
him
cheerfully
allow
himself
to
spend
and
be
spent
in
that
way
and
the
man
that
has
anything
bountifully
laughable
about
him
be
sure
there
is
more
in
that
man
than
you
perhaps
think
for
the
bar-room
was
now
full
of
the
boarders
who
had
been
dropping
in
the
night
previous
and
whom
i
had
not
as
yet
had
a
good
look
at
they
were
nearly
all
whalemen
chief
mates
and
second
mates
and
third
mates
and
sea
carpenters
and
sea
coopers
and
sea
blacksmiths
and
harpooneers
and
ship
keepers
a
brown
and
brawny
company
with
bosky
beards
an
unshorn
shaggy
set
all
wearing
monkey
jackets
for
morning
gowns
you
could
pretty
plainly
tell
how
long
each
one
had
been
ashore
this
young
fellow’s
healthy
cheek
is
like
a
sun-toasted
pear
in
hue
and
would
seem
to
smell
almost
as
musky
he
cannot
have
been
three
days
landed
from
his
indian
voyage
that
man
next
him
looks
a
few
shades
lighter
you
might
say
a
touch
of
satin
wood
is
in
him
in
the
complexion
of
a
third
still
lingers
a
tropic
tawn
but
slightly
bleached
withal
_he_
doubtless
has
tarried
whole
weeks
ashore
but
who
could
show
a
cheek
like
queequeg
which
barred
with
various
tints
seemed
like
the
andes’
western
slope
to
show
forth
in
one
array
contrasting
climates
zone
by
zone
“grub
ho!”
now
cried
the
landlord
flinging
open
a
door
and
in
we
went
to
breakfast
they
say
that
men
who
have
seen
the
world
thereby
become
quite
at
ease
in
manner
quite
self-possessed
in
company
not
always
though
ledyard
the
great
new
england
traveller
and
mungo
park
the
scotch
one
of
all
men
they
possessed
the
least
assurance
in
the
parlor
but
perhaps
the
mere
crossing
of
siberia
in
a
sledge
drawn
by
dogs
as
ledyard
did
or
the
taking
a
long
solitary
walk
on
an
empty
stomach
in
the
negro
heart
of
africa
which
was
the
sum
of
poor
mungo’s
performances—this
kind
of
travel
i
say
may
not
be
the
very
best
mode
of
attaining
a
high
social
polish
still
for
the
most
part
that
sort
of
thing
is
to
be
had
anywhere
these
reflections
just
here
are
occasioned
by
the
circumstance
that
after
we
were
all
seated
at
the
table
and
i
was
preparing
to
hear
some
good
stories
about
whaling
to
my
no
small
surprise
nearly
every
man
maintained
a
profound
silence
and
not
only
that
but
they
looked
embarrassed
yes
here
were
a
set
of
sea-dogs
many
of
whom
without
the
slightest
bashfulness
had
boarded
great
whales
on
the
high
seas—entire
strangers
to
them—and
duelled
them
dead
without
winking
and
yet
here
they
sat
at
a
social
breakfast
table—all
of
the
same
calling
all
of
kindred
tastes—looking
round
as
sheepishly
at
each
other
as
though
they
had
never
been
out
of
sight
of
some
sheepfold
among
the
green
mountains
a
curious
sight
these
bashful
bears
these
timid
warrior
whalemen
but
as
for
queequeg—why
queequeg
sat
there
among
them—at
the
head
of
the
table
too
it
so
chanced
as
cool
as
an
icicle
to
be
sure
i
cannot
say
much
for
his
breeding
his
greatest
admirer
could
not
have
cordially
justified
his
bringing
his
harpoon
into
breakfast
with
him
and
using
it
there
without
ceremony
reaching
over
the
table
with
it
to
the
imminent
jeopardy
of
many
heads
and
grappling
the
beefsteaks
towards
him
but
_that_
was
certainly
very
coolly
done
by
him
and
every
one
knows
that
in
most
people’s
estimation
to
do
anything
coolly
is
to
do
it
genteelly
we
will
not
speak
of
all
queequeg’s
peculiarities
here
how
he
eschewed
coffee
and
hot
rolls
and
applied
his
undivided
attention
to
beefsteaks
done
rare
enough
that
when
breakfast
was
over
he
withdrew
like
the
rest
into
the
public
room
lighted
his
tomahawk-pipe
and
was
sitting
there
quietly
digesting
and
smoking
with
his
inseparable
hat
on
when
i
sallied
out
for
a
stroll
chapter

the
street
if
i
had
been
astonished
at
first
catching
a
glimpse
of
so
outlandish
an
individual
as
queequeg
circulating
among
the
polite
society
of
a
civilized
town
that
astonishment
soon
departed
upon
taking
my
first
daylight
stroll
through
the
streets
of
new
bedford
in
thoroughfares
nigh
the
docks
any
considerable
seaport
will
frequently
offer
to
view
the
queerest
looking
nondescripts
from
foreign
parts
even
in
broadway
and
chestnut
streets
mediterranean
mariners
will
sometimes
jostle
the
affrighted
ladies
regent
street
is
not
unknown
to
lascars
and
malays
and
at
bombay
in
the
apollo
green
live
yankees
have
often
scared
the
natives
but
new
bedford
beats
all
water
street
and
wapping
in
these
last-mentioned
haunts
you
see
only
sailors
but
in
new
bedford
actual
cannibals
stand
chatting
at
street
corners
savages
outright
many
of
whom
yet
carry
on
their
bones
unholy
flesh
it
makes
a
stranger
stare
but
besides
the
feegeeans
tongatobooarrs
erromanggoans
pannangians
and
brighggians
and
besides
the
wild
specimens
of
the
whaling-craft
which
unheeded
reel
about
the
streets
you
will
see
other
sights
still
more
curious
certainly
more
comical
there
weekly
arrive
in
this
town
scores
of
green
vermonters
and
new
hampshire
men
all
athirst
for
gain
and
glory
in
the
fishery
they
are
mostly
young
of
stalwart
frames
fellows
who
have
felled
forests
and
now
seek
to
drop
the
axe
and
snatch
the
whale-lance
many
are
as
green
as
the
green
mountains
whence
they
came
in
some
things
you
would
think
them
but
a
few
hours
old
look
there
that
chap
strutting
round
the
corner
he
wears
a
beaver
hat
and
swallow-tailed
coat
girdled
with
a
sailor-belt
and
sheath-knife
here
comes
another
with
a
sou’-wester
and
a
bombazine
cloak
no
town-bred
dandy
will
compare
with
a
country-bred
one—i
mean
a
downright
bumpkin
dandy—a
fellow
that
in
the
dog-days
will
mow
his
two
acres
in
buckskin
gloves
for
fear
of
tanning
his
hands
now
when
a
country
dandy
like
this
takes
it
into
his
head
to
make
a
distinguished
reputation
and
joins
the
great
whale-fishery
you
should
see
the
comical
things
he
does
upon
reaching
the
seaport
in
bespeaking
his
sea-outfit
he
orders
bell-buttons
to
his
waistcoats
straps
to
his
canvas
trowsers
ah
poor
hay-seed
how
bitterly
will
burst
those
straps
in
the
first
howling
gale
when
thou
art
driven
straps
buttons
and
all
down
the
throat
of
the
tempest
but
think
not
that
this
famous
town
has
only
harpooneers
cannibals
and
bumpkins
to
show
her
visitors
not
at
all
still
new
bedford
is
a
queer
place
had
it
not
been
for
us
whalemen
that
tract
of
land
would
this
day
perhaps
have
been
in
as
howling
condition
as
the
coast
of
labrador
as
it
is
parts
of
her
back
country
are
enough
to
frighten
one
they
look
so
bony
the
town
itself
is
perhaps
the
dearest
place
to
live
in
in
all
new
england
it
is
a
land
of
oil
true
enough
but
not
like
canaan
a
land
also
of
corn
and
wine
the
streets
do
not
run
with
milk
nor
in
the
spring-time
do
they
pave
them
with
fresh
eggs
yet
in
spite
of
this
nowhere
in
all
america
will
you
find
more
patrician-like
houses
parks
and
gardens
more
opulent
than
in
new
bedford
whence
came
they
how
planted
upon
this
once
scraggy
scoria
of
a
country
go
and
gaze
upon
the
iron
emblematical
harpoons
round
yonder
lofty
mansion
and
your
question
will
be
answered
yes
all
these
brave
houses
and
flowery
gardens
came
from
the
atlantic
pacific
and
indian
oceans
one
and
all
they
were
harpooned
and
dragged
up
hither
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
can
herr
alexander
perform
a
feat
like
that
in
new
bedford
fathers
they
say
give
whales
for
dowers
to
their
daughters
and
portion
off
their
nieces
with
a
few
porpoises
a-piece
you
must
go
to
new
bedford
to
see
a
brilliant
wedding
for
they
say
they
have
reservoirs
of
oil
in
every
house
and
every
night
recklessly
burn
their
lengths
in
spermaceti
candles
in
summer
time
the
town
is
sweet
to
see
full
of
fine
maples—long
avenues
of
green
and
gold
and
in
august
high
in
air
the
beautiful
and
bountiful
horse-chestnuts
candelabra-wise
proffer
the
passer-by
their
tapering
upright
cones
of
congregated
blossoms
so
omnipotent
is
art
which
in
many
a
district
of
new
bedford
has
superinduced
bright
terraces
of
flowers
upon
the
barren
refuse
rocks
thrown
aside
at
creation’s
final
day
and
the
women
of
new
bedford
they
bloom
like
their
own
red
roses
but
roses
only
bloom
in
summer
whereas
the
fine
carnation
of
their
cheeks
is
perennial
as
sunlight
in
the
seventh
heavens
elsewhere
match
that
bloom
of
theirs
ye
cannot
save
in
salem
where
they
tell
me
the
young
girls
breathe
such
musk
their
sailor
sweethearts
smell
them
miles
off
shore
as
though
they
were
drawing
nigh
the
odorous
moluccas
instead
of
the
puritanic
sands
chapter

the
chapel
in
this
same
new
bedford
there
stands
a
whaleman’s
chapel
and
few
are
the
moody
fishermen
shortly
bound
for
the
indian
ocean
or
pacific
who
fail
to
make
a
sunday
visit
to
the
spot
i
am
sure
that
i
did
not
returning
from
my
first
morning
stroll
i
again
sallied
out
upon
this
special
errand
the
sky
had
changed
from
clear
sunny
cold
to
driving
sleet
and
mist
wrapping
myself
in
my
shaggy
jacket
of
the
cloth
called
bearskin
i
fought
my
way
against
the
stubborn
storm
entering
i
found
a
small
scattered
congregation
of
sailors
and
sailors’
wives
and
widows
a
muffled
silence
reigned
only
broken
at
times
by
the
shrieks
of
the
storm
each
silent
worshipper
seemed
purposely
sitting
apart
from
the
other
as
if
each
silent
grief
were
insular
and
incommunicable
the
chaplain
had
not
yet
arrived
and
there
these
silent
islands
of
men
and
women
sat
steadfastly
eyeing
several
marble
tablets
with
black
borders
masoned
into
the
wall
on
either
side
the
pulpit
three
of
them
ran
something
like
the
following
but
i
do
not
pretend
to
quote:—
sacred
to
the
memory
of
john
talbot
who
at
the
age
of
eighteen
was
lost
overboard
near
the
isle
of
desolation
off
patagonia
_november_
1_st_
1836
this
tablet
is
erected
to
his
memory
by
his
sister
sacred
to
the
memory
of
robert
long
willis
ellery
nathan
coleman
walter
canny
seth
macy
and
samuel
gleig
forming
one
of
the
boats’
crews
of
the
ship
eliza
who
were
towed
out
of
sight
by
a
whale
on
the
off-shore
ground
in
the
pacific
_december_
31_st_
1839
this
marble
is
here
placed
by
their
surviving
shipmates
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
late
captain
ezekiel
hardy
who
in
the
bows
of
his
boat
was
killed
by
a
sperm
whale
on
the
coast
of
japan
_august_
3_d_
1833
this
tablet
is
erected
to
his
memory
by
his
widow
shaking
off
the
sleet
from
my
ice-glazed
hat
and
jacket
i
seated
myself
near
the
door
and
turning
sideways
was
surprised
to
see
queequeg
near
me
affected
by
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
there
was
a
wondering
gaze
of
incredulous
curiosity
in
his
countenance
this
savage
was
the
only
person
present
who
seemed
to
notice
my
entrance
because
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
not
read
and
therefore
was
not
reading
those
frigid
inscriptions
on
the
wall
whether
any
of
the
relatives
of
the
seamen
whose
names
appeared
there
were
now
among
the
congregation
i
knew
not
but
so
many
are
the
unrecorded
accidents
in
the
fishery
and
so
plainly
did
several
women
present
wear
the
countenance
if
not
the
trappings
of
some
unceasing
grief
that
i
feel
sure
that
here
before
me
were
assembled
those
in
whose
unhealing
hearts
the
sight
of
those
bleak
tablets
sympathetically
caused
the
old
wounds
to
bleed
afresh
oh
ye
whose
dead
lie
buried
beneath
the
green
grass
who
standing
among
flowers
can
say—here
_here_
lies
my
beloved
ye
know
not
the
desolation
that
broods
in
bosoms
like
these
what
bitter
blanks
in
those
black-bordered
marbles
which
cover
no
ashes
what
despair
in
those
immovable
inscriptions
what
deadly
voids
and
unbidden
infidelities
in
the
lines
that
seem
to
gnaw
upon
all
faith
and
refuse
resurrections
to
the
beings
who
have
placelessly
perished
without
a
grave
as
well
might
those
tablets
stand
in
the
cave
of
elephanta
as
here
in
what
census
of
living
creatures
the
dead
of
mankind
are
included
why
it
is
that
a
universal
proverb
says
of
them
that
they
tell
no
tales
though
containing
more
secrets
than
the
goodwin
sands
how
it
is
that
to
his
name
who
yesterday
departed
for
the
other
world
we
prefix
so
significant
and
infidel
a
word
and
yet
do
not
thus
entitle
him
if
he
but
embarks
for
the
remotest
indies
of
this
living
earth
why
the
life
insurance
companies
pay
death-forfeitures
upon
immortals
in
what
eternal
unstirring
paralysis
and
deadly
hopeless
trance
yet
lies
antique
adam
who
died
sixty
round
centuries
ago
how
it
is
that
we
still
refuse
to
be
comforted
for
those
who
we
nevertheless
maintain
are
dwelling
in
unspeakable
bliss
why
all
the
living
so
strive
to
hush
all
the
dead
wherefore
but
the
rumor
of
a
knocking
in
a
tomb
will
terrify
a
whole
city
all
these
things
are
not
without
their
meanings
but
faith
like
a
jackal
feeds
among
the
tombs
and
even
from
these
dead
doubts
she
gathers
her
most
vital
hope
it
needs
scarcely
to
be
told
with
what
feelings
on
the
eve
of
a
nantucket
voyage
i
regarded
those
marble
tablets
and
by
the
murky
light
of
that
darkened
doleful
day
read
the
fate
of
the
whalemen
who
had
gone
before
me
yes
ishmael
the
same
fate
may
be
thine
but
somehow
i
grew
merry
again
delightful
inducements
to
embark
fine
chance
for
promotion
it
seems—aye
a
stove
boat
will
make
me
an
immortal
by
brevet
yes
there
is
death
in
this
business
of
whaling—a
speechlessly
quick
chaotic
bundling
of
a
man
into
eternity
but
what
then
methinks
we
have
hugely
mistaken
this
matter
of
life
and
death
methinks
that
what
they
call
my
shadow
here
on
earth
is
my
true
substance
methinks
that
in
looking
at
things
spiritual
we
are
too
much
like
oysters
observing
the
sun
through
the
water
and
thinking
that
thick
water
the
thinnest
of
air
methinks
my
body
is
but
the
lees
of
my
better
being
in
fact
take
my
body
who
will
take
it
i
say
it
is
not
me
and
therefore
three

8
the
pulpit
i
had
not
been
seated
very
long
ere
a
man
of
a
certain
venerable
robustness
entered
immediately
as
the
storm-pelted
door
flew
back
upon
admitting
him
a
quick
regardful
eyeing
of
him
by
all
the
congregation
sufficiently
attested
that
this
fine
old
man
was
the
chaplain
yes
it
was
the
famous
father
mapple
so
called
by
the
whalemen
among
whom
he
was
a
very
great
favourite
he
had
been
a
sailor
and
a
harpooneer
in
his
youth
but
for
many
years
past
had
dedicated
his
life
to
the
ministry
at
the
time
i
now
write
of
father
mapple
was
in
the
hardy
winter
of
a
healthy
old
age
that
sort
of
old
age
which
seems
merging
into
a
second
flowering
youth
for
among
all
the
fissures
of
his
wrinkles
there
shone
certain
mild
gleams
of
a
newly
developing
bloom—the
spring
verdure
peeping
forth
even
beneath
february’s
snow
no
one
having
previously
heard
his
history
could
for
the
first
time
behold
father
mapple
without
the
utmost
interest
because
there
were
certain
engrafted
clerical
peculiarities
about
him
imputable
to
that
adventurous
maritime
life
he
had
led
when
he
entered
i
observed
that
he
carried
no
umbrella
and
certainly
had
not
come
in
his
carriage
for
his
tarpaulin
hat
ran
down
with
melting
sleet
and
his
great
pilot
cloth
jacket
seemed
almost
to
drag
him
to
the
floor
with
the
weight
of
the
water
it
had
absorbed
however
hat
and
coat
and
overshoes
were
one
by
one
removed
and
hung
up
in
a
little
space
in
an
adjacent
corner
when
arrayed
in
a
decent
suit
he
quietly
approached
the
pulpit
like
most
old
fashioned
pulpits
it
was
a
very
lofty
one
and
since
a
regular
stairs
to
such
a
height
would
by
its
long
angle
with
the
floor
seriously
contract
the
already
small
area
of
the
chapel
the
architect
it
seemed
had
acted
upon
the
hint
of
father
mapple
and
finished
the
pulpit
without
a
stairs
substituting
a
perpendicular
side
ladder
like
those
used
in
mounting
a
ship
from
a
boat
at
sea
the
wife
of
a
whaling
captain
had
provided
the
chapel
with
a
handsome
pair
of
red
worsted
man-ropes
for
this
ladder
which
being
itself
nicely
headed
and
stained
with
a
mahogany
colour
the
whole
contrivance
considering
what
manner
of
chapel
it
was
seemed
by
no
means
in
bad
taste
halting
for
an
instant
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
and
with
both
hands
grasping
the
ornamental
knobs
of
the
man-ropes
father
mapple
cast
a
look
upwards
and
then
with
a
truly
sailor-like
but
still
reverential
dexterity
hand
over
hand
mounted
the
steps
as
if
ascending
the
main-top
of
his
vessel
the
perpendicular
parts
of
this
side
ladder
as
is
usually
the
case
with
swinging
ones
were
of
cloth-covered
rope
only
the
rounds
were
of
wood
so
that
at
every
step
there
was
a
joint
at
my
first
glimpse
of
the
pulpit
it
had
not
escaped
me
that
however
convenient
for
a
ship
these
joints
in
the
present
instance
seemed
unnecessary
for
i
was
not
prepared
to
see
father
mapple
after
gaining
the
height
slowly
turn
round
and
stooping
over
the
pulpit
deliberately
drag
up
the
ladder
step
by
step
till
the
whole
was
deposited
within
leaving
him
impregnable
in
his
little
quebec
i
pondered
some
time
without
fully
comprehending
the
reason
for
this
father
mapple
enjoyed
such
a
wide
reputation
for
sincerity
and
sanctity
that
i
could
not
suspect
him
of
courting
notoriety
by
any
mere
tricks
of
the
stage
no
thought
i
there
must
be
some
sober
reason
for
this
thing
furthermore
it
must
symbolize
something
unseen
can
it
be
then
that
by
that
act
of
physical
isolation
he
signifies
his
spiritual
withdrawal
for
the
time
from
all
outward
worldly
ties
and
connexions
yes
for
replenished
with
the
meat
and
wine
of
the
word
to
the
faithful
man
of
god
this
pulpit
i
see
is
a
self-containing
stronghold—a
lofty
ehrenbreitstein
with
a
perennial
well
of
water
within
the
walls
but
the
side
ladder
was
not
the
only
strange
feature
of
the
place
borrowed
from
the
chaplain’s
former
sea-farings
between
the
marble
cenotaphs
on
either
hand
of
the
pulpit
the
wall
which
formed
its
back
was
adorned
with
a
large
painting
representing
a
gallant
ship
beating
against
a
terrible
storm
off
a
lee
coast
of
black
rocks
and
snowy
breakers
but
high
above
the
flying
scud
and
dark-rolling
clouds
there
floated
a
little
isle
of
sunlight
from
which
beamed
forth
an
angel’s
face
and
this
bright
face
shed
a
distinct
spot
of
radiance
upon
the
ship’s
tossed
deck
something
like
that
silver
plate
now
inserted
into
the
victory’s
plank
where
nelson
fell
“ah
noble
ship,”
the
angel
seemed
to
say
“beat
on
beat
on
thou
noble
ship
and
bear
a
hardy
helm
for
lo
the
sun
is
breaking
through
the
clouds
are
rolling
off—serenest
azure
is
at
hand.”
nor
was
the
pulpit
itself
without
a
trace
of
the
same
sea-taste
that
had
achieved
the
ladder
and
the
picture
its
panelled
front
was
in
the
likeness
of
a
ship’s
bluff
bows
and
the
holy
bible
rested
on
a
projecting
piece
of
scroll
work
fashioned
after
a
ship’s
fiddle-headed
beak
what
could
be
more
full
of
meaning?—for
the
pulpit
is
ever
this
earth’s
foremost
part
all
the
rest
comes
in
its
rear
the
pulpit
leads
the
world
from
thence
it
is
the
storm
of
god’s
quick
wrath
is
first
descried
and
the
bow
must
bear
the
earliest
brunt
from
thence
it
is
the
god
of
breezes
fair
or
foul
is
first
invoked
for
favourable
winds
yes
the
world’s
a
ship
on
its
passage
out
and
not
a
voyage
complete
and
the
pulpit
is
its
prow
chapter
9
the
sermon
father
mapple
rose
and
in
a
mild
voice
of
unassuming
authority
ordered
the
scattered
people
to
condense
“starboard
gangway
there
side
away
to
larboard—larboard
gangway
to
starboard
midships
midships!”
there
was
a
low
rumbling
of
heavy
sea-boots
among
the
benches
and
a
still
slighter
shuffling
of
women’s
shoes
and
all
was
quiet
again
and
every
eye
on
the
preacher
he
paused
a
little
then
kneeling
in
the
pulpit’s
bows
folded
his
large
brown
hands
across
his
chest
uplifted
his
closed
eyes
and
offered
a
prayer
so
deeply
devout
that
he
seemed
kneeling
and
praying
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
this
ended
in
prolonged
solemn
tones
like
the
continual
tolling
of
a
bell
in
a
ship
that
is
foundering
at
sea
in
a
fog—in
such
tones
he
commenced
reading
the
following
hymn
but
changing
his
manner
towards
the
concluding
stanzas
burst
forth
with
a
pealing
exultation
and
joy—
“the
ribs
and
terrors
in
the
whale
arched
over
me
a
dismal
gloom
while
all
god’s
sun-lit
waves
rolled
by
and
lift
me
deepening
down
to
doom
“i
saw
the
opening
maw
of
hell
with
endless
pains
and
sorrows
there
which
none
but
they
that
feel
can
tell—
oh
i
was
plunging
to
despair
“in
black
distress
i
called
my
god
when
i
could
scarce
believe
him
mine
he
bowed
his
ear
to
my
complaints—
no
more
the
whale
did
me
confine
“with
speed
he
flew
to
my
relief
as
on
a
radiant
dolphin
borne
awful
yet
bright
as
lightning
shone
the
face
of
my
deliverer
god
“my
song
for
ever
shall
record
that
terrible
that
joyful
hour
i
give
the
glory
to
my
god
his
all
the
mercy
and
the
power.”
nearly
all
joined
in
singing
this
hymn
which
swelled
high
above
the
howling
of
the
storm
a
brief
pause
ensued
the
preacher
slowly
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
bible
and
at
last
folding
his
hand
down
upon
the
proper
page
said
“beloved
shipmates
clinch
the
last
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
jonah—‘and
god
had
prepared
a
great
fish
to
swallow
up
jonah.’”
“shipmates
this
book
containing
only
four
chapters—four
yarns—is
one
of
the
smallest
strands
in
the
mighty
cable
of
the
scriptures
yet
what
depths
of
the
soul
does
jonah’s
deep
sealine
sound
what
a
pregnant
lesson
to
us
is
this
prophet
what
a
noble
thing
is
that
canticle
in
the
fish’s
belly
how
billow-like
and
boisterously
grand
we
feel
the
floods
surging
over
us
we
sound
with
him
to
the
kelpy
bottom
of
the
waters
sea-weed
and
all
the
slime
of
the
sea
is
about
us
but
_what_
is
this
lesson
that
the
book
of
jonah
teaches
shipmates
it
is
a
two-stranded
lesson
a
lesson
to
us
all
as
sinful
men
and
a
lesson
to
me
as
a
pilot
of
the
living
god
as
sinful
men
it
is
a
lesson
to
us
all
because
it
is
a
story
of
the
sin
hard-heartedness
suddenly
awakened
fears
the
swift
punishment
repentance
prayers
and
finally
the
deliverance
and
joy
of
jonah
as
with
all
sinners
among
men
the
sin
of
this
son
of
amittai
was
in
his
wilful
disobedience
of
the
command
of
god—never
mind
now
what
that
command
was
or
how
conveyed—which
he
found
a
hard
command
but
all
the
things
that
god
would
have
us
do
are
hard
for
us
to
do—remember
that—and
hence
he
oftener
commands
us
than
endeavors
to
persuade
and
if
we
obey
god
we
must
disobey
ourselves
and
it
is
in
this
disobeying
ourselves
wherein
the
hardness
of
obeying
god
consists
“with
this
sin
of
disobedience
in
him
jonah
still
further
flouts
at
god
by
seeking
to
flee
from
him
he
thinks
that
a
ship
made
by
men
will
carry
him
into
countries
where
god
does
not
reign
but
only
the
captains
of
this
earth
he
skulks
about
the
wharves
of
joppa
and
seeks
a
ship
that’s
bound
for
tarshish
there
lurks
perhaps
a
hitherto
unheeded
meaning
here
by
all
accounts
tarshish
could
have
been
no
other
city
than
the
modern
cadiz
that’s
the
opinion
of
learned
men
and
where
is
cadiz
shipmates
cadiz
is
in
spain
as
far
by
water
from
joppa
as
jonah
could
possibly
have
sailed
in
those
ancient
days
when
the
atlantic
was
an
almost
unknown
sea
because
joppa
the
modern
jaffa
shipmates
is
on
the
most
easterly
coast
of
the
mediterranean
the
syrian
and
tarshish
or
cadiz
more
than
two
thousand
miles
to
the
westward
from
that
just
outside
the
straits
of
gibraltar
see
ye
not
then
shipmates
that
jonah
sought
to
flee
world-wide
from
god
miserable
man
oh
most
contemptible
and
worthy
of
all
scorn
with
slouched
hat
and
guilty
eye
skulking
from
his
god
prowling
among
the
shipping
like
a
vile
burglar
hastening
to
cross
the
seas
so
disordered
self-condemning
is
his
look
that
had
there
been
policemen
in
those
days
jonah
on
the
mere
suspicion
of
something
wrong
had
been
arrested
ere
he
touched
a
deck
how
plainly
he’s
a
fugitive
no
baggage
not
a
hat-box
valise
or
carpet-bag,—no
friends
accompany
him
to
the
wharf
with
their
adieux
at
last
after
much
dodging
search
he
finds
the
tarshish
ship
receiving
the
last
items
of
her
cargo
and
as
he
steps
on
board
to
see
its
captain
in
the
cabin
all
the
sailors
for
the
moment
desist
from
hoisting
in
the
goods
to
mark
the
stranger’s
evil
eye
jonah
sees
this
but
in
vain
he
tries
to
look
all
ease
and
confidence
in
vain
essays
his
wretched
smile
strong
intuitions
of
the
man
assure
the
mariners
he
can
be
no
innocent
in
their
gamesome
but
still
serious
way
one
whispers
to
the
other—“jack
he’s
robbed
a
widow;”
or
“joe
do
you
mark
him
he’s
a
bigamist;”
or
“harry
lad
i
guess
he’s
the
adulterer
that
broke
jail
in
old
gomorrah
or
belike
one
of
the
missing
murderers
from
sodom.”
another
runs
to
read
the
bill
that’s
stuck
against
the
spile
upon
the
wharf
to
which
the
ship
is
moored
offering
five
hundred
gold
coins
for
the
apprehension
of
a
parricide
and
containing
a
description
of
his
person
he
reads
and
looks
from
jonah
to
the
bill
while
all
his
sympathetic
shipmates
now
crowd
round
jonah
prepared
to
lay
their
hands
upon
him
frighted
jonah
trembles
and
summoning
all
his
boldness
to
his
face
only
looks
so
much
the
more
a
coward
he
will
not
confess
himself
suspected
but
that
itself
is
strong
suspicion
so
he
makes
the
best
of
it
and
when
the
sailors
find
him
not
to
be
the
man
that
is
advertised
they
let
him
pass
and
he
descends
into
the
cabin
“‘who’s
there?’
cries
the
captain
at
his
busy
desk
hurriedly
making
out
his
papers
for
the
customs—‘who’s
there?’
oh
how
that
harmless
question
mangles
jonah
for
the
instant
he
almost
turns
to
flee
again
but
he
rallies
‘i
seek
a
passage
in
this
ship
to
tarshish
how
soon
sail
ye
sir?’
thus
far
the
busy
captain
had
not
looked
up
to
jonah
though
the
man
now
stands
before
him
but
no
sooner
does
he
hear
that
hollow
voice
than
he
darts
a
scrutinizing
glance
‘we
sail
with
the
next
coming
tide,’
at
last
he
slowly
answered
still
intently
eyeing
him
‘no
sooner
sir?’—‘soon
enough
for
any
honest
man
that
goes
a
passenger.’
ha
jonah
that’s
another
stab
but
he
swiftly
calls
away
the
captain
from
that
scent
‘i’ll
sail
with
ye,’—he
says,—‘the
passage
money
how
much
is
that?—i’ll
pay
now.’
for
it
is
particularly
written
shipmates
as
if
it
were
a
thing
not
to
be
overlooked
in
this
history
‘that
he
paid
the
fare
thereof’
ere
the
craft
did
sail
and
taken
with
the
context
this
is
full
of
meaning
“now
jonah’s
captain
shipmates
was
one
whose
discernment
detects
crime
in
any
but
whose
cupidity
exposes
it
only
in
the
penniless
in
this
world
shipmates
sin
that
pays
its
way
can
travel
freely
and
without
a
passport
whereas
virtue
if
a
pauper
is
stopped
at
all
frontiers
so
jonah’s
captain
prepares
to
test
the
length
of
jonah’s
purse
ere
he
judge
him
openly
he
charges
him
thrice
the
usual
sum
and
it’s
assented
to
then
the
captain
knows
that
jonah
is
a
fugitive
but
at
the
same
time
resolves
to
help
a
flight
that
paves
its
rear
with
gold
yet
when
jonah
fairly
takes
out
his
purse
prudent
suspicions
still
molest
the
captain
he
rings
every
coin
to
find
a
counterfeit
not
a
forger
any
way
he
mutters
and
jonah
is
put
down
for
his
passage
‘point
out
my
state-room
sir,’
says
jonah
now
‘i’m
travel-weary
i
need
sleep.’
‘thou
lookest
like
it,’
says
the
captain
‘there’s
thy
room.’
jonah
enters
and
would
lock
the
door
but
the
lock
contains
no
key
hearing
him
foolishly
fumbling
there
the
captain
laughs
lowly
to
himself
and
mutters
something
about
the
doors
of
convicts’
cells
being
never
allowed
to
be
locked
within
all
dressed
and
dusty
as
he
is
jonah
throws
himself
into
his
berth
and
finds
the
little
state-room
ceiling
almost
resting
on
his
forehead
the
air
is
close
and
jonah
gasps
then
in
that
contracted
hole
sunk
too
beneath
the
ship’s
water-line
jonah
feels
the
heralding
presentiment
of
that
stifling
hour
when
the
whale
shall
hold
him
in
the
smallest
of
his
bowels’
wards
“screwed
at
its
axis
against

eyes
roll
round
the
place
and
this
thus
far
successful
fugitive
finds
no
refuge
for
his
restless
glance
but
that
contradiction
in
the
lamp
more
and
more
appals
him
the
floor
the
ceiling
and
the
side
are
all
awry
‘oh
so
my
conscience
hangs
in
me!’
he
groans
‘straight
upwards
so
it
burns
but
the
chambers
of
my
soul
are
all
in
crookedness!’
“like
one
who
after
a
night
of
drunken
revelry
hies
to
his
bed
still
reeling
but
with
conscience
yet
pricking
him
as
the
plungings
of
the
roman
race-horse
but
so
much
the
more
strike
his
steel
tags
into
him
as
one
who
in
that
miserable
plight
still
turns
and
turns
in
giddy
anguish
praying
god
for
annihilation
until
the
fit
be
passed
and
at
last
amid
the
whirl
of
woe
he
feels
a
deep
stupor
steals
over
him
as
over
the
man
who
bleeds
to
death
for
conscience
is
the
wound
and
there’s
naught
to
staunch
it
so
after
sore
wrestlings
in
his
berth
jonah’s
prodigy
of
ponderous
misery
drags
him
drowning
down
to
sleep
“and
now
the
time
of
tide
has
come
the
ship
casts
off
her
cables
and
from
the
deserted
wharf
the
uncheered
ship
for
tarshish
all
careening
glides
to
sea
that
ship
my
friends
was
the
first
of
recorded
smugglers
the
contraband
was
jonah
but
the
sea
rebels
he
will
not
bear
the
wicked
burden
a
dreadful
storm
comes
on
the
ship
is
like
to
break
but
now
when
the
boatswain
calls
all
hands
to
lighten
her
when
boxes
bales
and
jars
are
clattering
overboard
when
the
wind
is
shrieking
and
the
men
are
yelling
and
every
plank
thunders
with
trampling
feet
right
over
jonah’s
head
in
all
this
raging
tumult
jonah
sleeps
his
hideous
sleep
he
sees
no
black
sky
and
raging
sea
feels
not
the
reeling
timbers
and
little
hears
he
or
heeds
he
the
far
rush
of
the
mighty
whale
which
even
now
with
open
mouth
is
cleaving
the
seas
after
him
aye
shipmates
jonah
was
gone
down
into
the
sides
of
the
ship—a
berth
in
the
cabin
as
i
have
taken
it
and
was
fast
asleep
but
the
frightened
master
comes
to
him
and
shrieks
in
his
dead
ear
‘what
meanest
thou
o
sleeper
arise!’
startled
from
his
lethargy
by
that
direful
cry
jonah
staggers
to
his
feet
and
stumbling
to
the
deck
grasps
a
shroud
to
look
out
upon
the
sea
but
at
that
moment
he
is
sprung
upon
by
a
panther
billow
leaping
over
the
bulwarks
wave
after
wave
thus
leaps
into
the
ship
and
finding
no
speedy
vent
runs
roaring
fore
and
aft
till
the
mariners
come
nigh
to
drowning
while
yet
afloat
and
ever
as
the
white
moon
shows
her
affrighted
face
from
the
steep
gullies
in
the
blackness
overhead
aghast
jonah
sees
the
rearing
bowsprit
pointing
high
upward
but
soon
beat
downward
again
towards
the
tormented
deep
“terrors
upon
terrors
run
shouting
through
his
soul
in
all
his
cringing
attitudes
the
god-fugitive
is
now
too
plainly
known
the
sailors
mark
him
more
and
more
certain
grow
their
suspicions
of
him
and
at
last
fully
to
test
the
truth
by
referring
the
whole
matter
to
high
heaven
they
fall
to
casting
lots
to
see
for
whose
cause
this
great
tempest
was
upon
them
the
lot
is
jonah’s
that
discovered
then
how
furiously
they
mob
him
with
their
questions
‘what
is
thine
occupation
whence
comest
thou
thy
country
what
people
but
mark
now
my
shipmates
the
behavior
of
poor
jonah
the
eager
mariners
but
ask
him
who
he
is
and
where
from
whereas
they
not
only
receive
an
answer
to
those
questions
but
likewise
another
answer
to
a
question
not
put
by
them
but
the
unsolicited
answer
is
forced
from
jonah
by
the
hard
hand
of
god
that
is
upon
him
“‘i
am
a
hebrew,’
he
cries—and
then—‘i
fear
the
lord
the
god
of
heaven
who
hath
made
the
sea
and
the
dry
land!’
fear
him
o
jonah
aye
well
mightest
thou
fear
the
lord
god
_then!_
straightway
he
now
goes
on
to
make
a
full
confession
whereupon
the
mariners
became
more
and
more
appalled
but
still
are
pitiful
for
when
jonah
not
yet
supplicating
god
for
mercy
since
he
but
too
well
knew
the
darkness
of
his
deserts,—when
wretched
jonah
cries
out
to
them
to
take
him
and
cast
him
forth
into
the
sea
for
he
knew
that
for
_his_
sake
this
great
tempest
was
upon
them
they
mercifully
turn
from
him
and
seek
by
other
means
to
save
the
ship
but
all
in
vain
the
indignant
gale
howls
louder
then
with
one
hand
raised
invokingly
to
god
with
the
other
they
not
unreluctantly
lay
hold
of
jonah
“and
now
behold
jonah
taken
up
as
an
anchor
and
dropped
into
the
sea
when
instantly
an
oily
calmness
floats
out
from
the
east
and
the
sea
is
still
as
jonah
carries
down
the
gale
with
him
leaving
smooth
water
behind
he
goes
down
in
the
whirling
heart
of
such
a
masterless
commotion
that
he
scarce
heeds
the
moment
when
he
drops
seething
into
the
yawning
jaws
awaiting
him
and
the
whale
shoots-to
all
his
ivory
teeth
like
so
many
white
bolts
upon
his
prison
then
jonah
prayed
unto
the
lord
out
of
the
fish’s
belly
but
observe
his
prayer
and
learn
a
weighty
lesson
for
sinful
as
he
is
jonah
does
not
weep
and
wail
for
direct
deliverance
he
feels
that
his
dreadful
punishment
is
just
he
leaves
all
his
deliverance
to
god
contenting
himself
with
this
that
spite
of
all
his
pains
and
pangs
he
will
still
look
towards
his
holy
temple
and
here
shipmates
is
true
and
faithful
repentance
not
clamorous
for
pardon
but
grateful
for
punishment
and
how
pleasing
to
god
was
this
conduct
in
jonah
is
shown
in
the
eventual
deliverance
of
him
from
the
sea
and
the
whale
shipmates
i
do
not
place
jonah
before
you
to
be
copied
for
his
sin
but
i
do
place
him
before
you
as
a
model
for
repentance
sin
not
but
if
you
do
take
heed
to
repent
of
it
like
jonah.”
while
he
was
speaking
these
words
the
howling
of
the
shrieking
slanting
storm
without
seemed
to
add
new
power
to
the
preacher
who
when
describing
jonah’s
sea-storm
seemed
tossed
by
a
storm
himself
his
deep
chest
heaved
as
with
a
ground-swell
his
tossed
arms
seemed
the
warring
elements
at
work
and
the
thunders
that
rolled
away
from
off
his
swarthy
brow
and
the
light
leaping
from
his
eye
made
all
his
simple
hearers
look
on
him
with
a
quick
fear
that
was
strange
to
them
there
now
came
a
lull
in
his
look
as
he
silently
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
once
more
and
at
last
standing
motionless
with
closed
eyes
for
the
moment
seemed
communing
with
god
and
himself
but
again
he
leaned
over
towards
the
people
and
bowing
his
head
lowly
with
an
aspect
of
the
deepest
yet
manliest
humility
he
spake
these
words
“shipmates
god
has
laid
but
one
hand
upon
you
both
his
hands
press
upon
me
i
have
read
ye
by
what
murky
light
may
be
mine
the
lesson
that
jonah
teaches
to
all
sinners
and
therefore
to
ye
and
still
more
to
me
for
i
am
a
greater
sinner
than
ye
and
now
how
gladly
would
i
come
down
from
this
mast-head
and
sit
on
the
hatches
there
where
you
sit
and
listen
as
you
listen
while
some
one
of
you
reads
_me_
that
other
and
more
awful
lesson
which
jonah
teaches
to
_me_
as
a
pilot
of
the
living
god
how
being
an
anointed
pilot-prophet
or
speaker
of
true
things
and
bidden
by
the
lord
to
sound
those
unwelcome
truths
in
the
ears
of
a
wicked
nineveh
jonah
appalled
at
the
hostility
he
should
raise
fled
from
his
mission
and
sought
to
escape
his
duty
and
his
god
by
taking
ship
at
joppa
but
god
is
everywhere
tarshish
he
never
reached
as
we
have
seen
god
came
upon
him
in
the
whale
and
swallowed
him
down
to
living
gulfs
of
doom
and
with
swift
slantings
tore
him
along
‘into
the
midst
of
the
seas,’
where
the
eddying
depths
sucked
him
ten
thousand
fathoms
down
and
‘the
weeds
were
wrapped
about
his
head,’
and
all
the
watery
world
of
woe
bowled
over
him
yet
even
then
beyond
the
reach
of
any
plummet—‘out
of
the
belly
of
hell’—when
the
whale
grounded
upon
the
ocean’s
utmost
bones
even
then
god
heard
the
engulphed
repenting
prophet
when
he
cried
then
god
spake
unto
the
fish
and
from
the
shuddering
cold
and
blackness
of
the
sea
the
whale
came
breeching
up
towards
the
warm
and
pleasant
sun
and
all
the
delights
of
air
and
earth
and
‘vomited
out
jonah
upon
the
dry
land;’
when
the
word
of
the
lord
came
a
second
time
and
jonah
bruised
and
beaten—his
ears
like
two
sea-shells
still
multitudinously
murmuring
of
the
ocean—jonah
did
the
almighty’s
bidding
and
what
was
that
shipmates
to
preach
the
truth
to
the
face
of
falsehood
that
was
it
“this
shipmates
this
is
that
other
lesson
and
woe
to
that
pilot
of
the
living
god
who
slights
it
woe
to
him
whom
this
world
charms
from
gospel
duty
woe
to
him
who
seeks
to
pour
oil
upon
the
waters
when
god
has
brewed
them
into
a
gale
woe
to
him
who
seeks
to
please
rather
than
to
appal
woe
to
him
whose
good
name
is
more
to
him
than
goodness
woe
to
him
who
in
this
world
courts
not
dishonor
woe
to
him
who
would
not
be
true
even
though
to
be
false
were
salvation
yea
woe
to
him
who
as
the
great
pilot
paul
has
it
while
preaching
to
others
is
himself
a
castaway!”
he
dropped
and
fell
away
from
himself
for
a
moment
then
lifting
his
face
to
them
again
showed
a
deep
joy
in
his
eyes
as
he
cried
out
with
a
heavenly
enthusiasm,—“but
oh
shipmates
on
the
starboard
hand
of
every
woe
there
is
a
sure
delight
and
higher
the
top
of
that
delight
than
the
bottom
of
the
woe
is
deep
is
not
the
main-truck
higher
than
the
kelson
is
low
delight
is
to
him—a
far
far
upward
and
inward
delight—who
against
the
proud
gods
and
commodores
of
this
earth
ever
stands
forth
his
own
inexorable
self

is
to
him
whose
strong
arms
yet
support
him
when
the

of
this
base
treacherous
world

gone
down

is
to
him

gives
no

and
destroys
all
sin
though
he

it
out
from

the

his

is
to
him

billows
of
the

can
never
shake
from
this
sure
keel
of
the
ages

eternal
delight

deliciousness
will
be

coming
to
lay
him
down

say
with
his
final
breath—o

me

he
said
no
more
but
slowly
waving
a
benediction
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
so
remained
kneeling
till
all
the
people
had
departed
and
he
was
left
alone
in
the
place
chapter
10
a
bosom
friend
returning
to
the
spouter-inn
from
the
chapel
i
found
queequeg
there
quite
alone
he
having
left
the
chapel
before
the
benediction
some
time
he
was
sitting
on
a
bench
before
the
fire
with
his
feet
on
the
stove
hearth
and
in
one
hand
was
holding
close
up
to
his
face
that
little
negro
idol
of
his
peering
hard
into
its
face
and
with
a
jack-knife
gently
whittling
away
at
its
nose
meanwhile
humming
to
himself
in
his
heathenish
way
but
being
now
interrupted
he
put
up
the
image
and
pretty
soon
going
to
the
table
took
up
a
large
book
there
and
placing
it
on
his
lap
began
counting
the
pages
with
deliberate
regularity
at
every
fiftieth
page—as
i
fancied—stopping
a
moment
looking
vacantly
around
him
and
giving
utterance
to
a
long-drawn
gurgling
whistle
of
astonishment
he
would
then
begin
again
at
the
next
fifty
seeming
to
commence
at
number
one
each
time
as
though
he
could
not
count
more
than
fifty
and
it
was
only
by
such
a
large
number
of
fifties
being
found
together
that
his
astonishment
at
the
multitude
of
pages
was
excited
with
much
interest
i
sat
watching
him
savage
though
he
was
and
hideously
marred
about
the
face—at
least
to
my
taste—his
countenance
yet
had
a
something
in
it
which
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
you
cannot
hide
the
soul
through
all
his
unearthly
tattooings
i
thought
i
saw
the
traces
of
a
simple
honest
heart
and
in
his
large
deep
eyes
fiery
black
and
bold
there
seemed
tokens
of
a
spirit
that
would
dare
a
thousand
devils
and
besides
all
this
there
was
a
certain
lofty
bearing
about
the
pagan
which
even
his
uncouthness
could
not
altogether
maim
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
never
cringed
and
never
had
had
a
creditor
whether
it
was
too
that
his
head
being
shaved
his
forehead
was
drawn
out
in
freer
and
brighter
relief
and
looked
more
expansive
than
it
otherwise
would
this
i
will
not
venture
to
decide
but
certain
it
was
his
head
was
phrenologically
an
excellent
one
it
may
seem
ridiculous
but
it
reminded
me
of
general
washington’s
head
as
seen
in
the
popular
busts
of
him
it
had
the
same
long
regularly
graded
retreating
slope
from
above
the
brows
which
were
likewise
very
projecting
like
two
long
promontories
thickly
wooded
on
top
queequeg
was
george
washington
cannibalistically
developed
whilst
i
was
thus
closely
scanning
him
half-pretending
meanwhile
to
be
looking
out
at
the
storm
from
the
casement
he
never
heeded
my
presence
never
troubled
himself
with
so
much
as
a
single
glance
but
appeared
wholly
occupied
with
counting
the
pages
of
the
marvellous
book
considering
how
sociably
we
had
been
sleeping
together
the
night
previous
and
especially
considering
the
affectionate
arm
i
had
found
thrown
over
me
upon
waking
in
the
morning
i
thought
this
indifference
of
his
very
strange
but
savages
are
strange
beings
at
times
you
do
not
know
exactly
how
to
take
them
at
first
they
are
overawing
their
calm
self-collectedness
of
simplicity
seems
a
socratic
wisdom
i
had
noticed
also
that
queequeg
never
consorted
at
all
or
but
very
little
with
the
other
seamen
in
the
inn
he
made
no
advances
whatever
appeared
to
have
no
desire
to
enlarge
the
circle
of
his
acquaintances
all
this
struck
me
as
mighty
singular
yet
upon
second
thoughts
there
was
something
almost
sublime
in
it
here
was
a
man
some
twenty
thousand
miles
from
home
by
the
way
of
cape
horn
that
is—which
was
the
only
way
he
could
get
there—thrown
among
people
as
strange
to
him
as
though
he
were
in
the
planet
jupiter
and
yet
he
seemed
entirely
at
his
ease
preserving
the
utmost
serenity
content
with
his
own
companionship
always
equal
to
himself
surely
this
was
a
touch
of
fine
philosophy
though
no
doubt
he
had
never
heard
there
was
such
a
thing
as
that
but
perhaps
to
be
true
philosophers
we
mortals
should
not
be
conscious
of
so
living
or
so
striving
so
soon
as
i
hear
that
such
or
such
a
man
gives
himself
out
for
a
philosopher
i
conclude
that
like
the
dyspeptic
old
woman
he
must
have
“broken
his
digester.”
as
i
sat
there
in
that
now
lonely
room
the
fire
burning
low
in
that
mild
stage
when
after
its
first
intensity
has
warmed
the
air
it
then
only
glows
to
be
looked
at
the
evening
shades
and
phantoms
gathering
round
the
casements
and
peering
in
upon
us
silent
solitary
twain
the
storm
booming
without
in
solemn
swells
i
began
to
be
sensible
of
strange
feelings
i
felt
a
melting
in
me
no
more
my
splintered
heart
and
maddened
hand
were
turned
against
the
wolfish
world
this
soothing
savage
had
redeemed
it
there
he
sat
his
very
indifference
speaking
a
nature
in
which
there
lurked
no
civilized
hypocrisies
and
bland
deceits
wild
he
was
a
very
sight
of
sights
to
see
yet
i
began
to
feel
myself
mysteriously
drawn
towards
him
and
those
same
things
that
would
have
repelled
most
others
they
were
the
very
magnets
that
thus
drew
me
i’ll
try
a
pagan
friend
thought
i
since
christian
kindness
has
proved
but
hollow
courtesy
i
drew
my
bench
near
him
and
made
some
friendly
signs
and
hints
doing
my
best
to
talk
with
him
meanwhile
at
first
he
little
noticed
these
advances
but
presently
upon
my
referring
to
his
last
night’s
hospitalities
he
made
out
to
ask
me
whether
we
were
again
to
be
bedfellows
i
told
him
yes
whereat
i
thought
he
looked
pleased
perhaps
a
little
complimented
we
then
turned
over
the
book
together
and
i
endeavored
to
explain
to
him
the
purpose
of
the
printing
and
the
meaning
of
the
few
pictures
that
were
in
it
thus
i
soon
engaged
his
interest
and
from
that
we
went
to
jabbering
the
best
we
could
about
the
various
outer
sights
to
be
seen
in
this
famous
town
soon
i
proposed
a
social
smoke
and
producing
his
pouch
and
tomahawk
he
quietly
offered
me
a
puff
and
then
we
sat
exchanging
puffs
from
that
wild
pipe
of
his
and
keeping
it
regularly
passing
between
us
if
there
yet
lurked
any
ice
of
indifference
towards
me
in
the
pagan’s
breast
this
pleasant
genial
smoke
we
had
soon
thawed
it
out
and
left
us
cronies
he
seemed
to
take
to
me
quite
as
naturally
and
unbiddenly
as
i
to
him
and
when
our
smoke
was
over
he
pressed
his
forehead
against
mine
clasped
me
round
the
waist
and
said
that
henceforth
we
were
married
meaning
in
his
country’s
phrase
that
we
were
bosom
friends
he
would
gladly
die
for
me
if
need
should
be
in
a
countryman
this
sudden
flame
of
friendship
would
have
seemed
far
too
premature
a
thing
to
be
much
distrusted
but
in
this
simple
savage
those
old
rules
would
not
apply
after
supper
and
another
social
chat
and
smoke
we
went
to
our
room
together
he
made
me
a
present
of
his
embalmed
head
took
out
his
enormous
tobacco
wallet
and
groping
under
the
tobacco
drew
out
some
thirty
dollars
in
silver
then
spreading
them
on
the
table
and
mechanically
dividing
them
into
two
equal
portions
pushed
one
of
them
towards
me
and
said
it
was
mine
i
was
going
to
remonstrate
but
he
silenced
me
by
pouring
them
into
my
trowsers’
pockets
i
let
them
stay
he
then
went
about
his
evening
prayers
took
out
his
idol
and
removed
the
paper
fireboard
by
certain
signs
and
symptoms
i
thought
he
seemed
anxious
for
me
to
join
him
but
well
knowing
what
was
to
follow
i
deliberated
a
moment
whether
in
case
he
invited
me
i
would
comply
or
otherwise
i
was
a
good
christian
born
and
bred
in
the
bosom
of
the
infallible
presbyterian
church
how
then
could
i
unite
with
this
wild
idolator
in
worshipping
his
piece
of
wood
but
what
is
worship
thought
i
do
you
suppose
now
ishmael
that
the
magnanimous
god
of
heaven
and
earth—pagans
and
all
included—can
possibly
be
jealous
of
an
insignificant
bit
of
black
wood
impossible
but
what
is
worship?—to
do
the
will
of
god—_that_
is
worship
and
what
is
the
will
of
god?—to
do
to
my
fellow
man
what
i
would
have
my
fellow
man
to
do
to
me—_that_
is
the
will
of
god
now
queequeg
is
my
fellow
man
and
what
do
i
wish
that
this
queequeg
would
do
to
me
why
unite
with
me
in
my
particular
presbyterian
form
of
worship
consequently
i
must
then
unite
with
him
in
his
ergo
i
must
turn
idolator
so
i
kindled
the
shavings
helped
prop
up
the
innocent
little
idol
offered
him
burnt
biscuit
with
queequeg
salamed
before
him
twice
or
thrice
kissed
his
nose
and
that
done
we
undressed
and
went
to
bed
at
peace
with
our
own
consciences
and
all
the
world
but
we
did
not
go
to
sleep
without
some
little
chat
how
it
is
i
know
not
but
there
is
no
place
like
a
bed
for
confidential
disclosures
between
friends
man
and
wife
they
say
there
open
the
very
bottom
of
their
souls
to
each
other
and
some
old
couples
often
lie
and
chat
over
old
times
till
nearly
morning
thus
then
in
our
hearts’
honeymoon
lay
i
and
queequeg—a
cosy
loving
pair
chapter
11
nightgown
we
had
lain
thus
in
bed
chatting
and
napping
at
short
intervals
and
queequeg
now
and
then
affectionately
throwing
his
brown
tattooed
legs
over
mine
and
then
drawing
them
back
so
entirely
sociable
and
free
and
easy
were
we
when
at
last
by
reason
of
our
confabulations
what
little
nappishness
remained
in
us
altogether
departed
and
we
felt
like
getting
up
again
though
day-break
was
yet
some
way
down
the
future
yes
we
became
very
wakeful
so
much
so
that
our
recumbent
position
began
to
grow
wearisome
and
by
little
and
little
we
found
ourselves
sitting
up
the
clothes
well
tucked
around
us
leaning
against
the
head-board
with
our
four
knees
drawn
up
close
together
and
our
two
noses
bending
over
them
as
if
our
kneepans
were
warming-pans
we
felt
very
nice
and
snug
the
more
so
since
it
was
so
chilly
out
of
doors
indeed
out
of
bed-clothes
too
seeing
that
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
the
more
so
i
say
because
truly
to
enjoy
bodily
warmth
some
small
part
of
you
must
be
cold
for
there
is
no
quality
in
this
world
that
is
not
what
it
is
merely
by
contrast
nothing
exists
in
itself
if
you
flatter
yourself
that
you
are
all
over
comfortable
and
have
been
so
a
long
time
then
you
cannot
be
said
to
be
comfortable
any
more
but
if
like
queequeg
and
me
in
the
bed
the
tip
of
your
nose
or
the
crown
of
your
head
be
slightly
chilled
why
then
indeed
in
the
general
consciousness
you
feel
most
delightfully
and
unmistakably
warm
for
this
reason
a
sleeping
apartment
should
never
be
furnished
with
a
fire
which
is
one
of
the
luxurious
discomforts
of
the
rich
for
the
height
of
this
sort
of
deliciousness
is
to
have
nothing
but
the
blanket
between
you
and
your
snugness
and
the
cold
of
the
outer
air
then
there
you
lie
like
the
one
warm
spark
in
the
heart
of
an
arctic
crystal
we
had
been
sitting
in
this
crouching
manner
for
some
time
when
all
at
once
i
thought
i
would
open
my
eyes
for
when
between
sheets
whether
by
day
or
by
night
and
whether
asleep
or
awake
i
have
a
way
of
always
keeping
my
eyes
shut
in
order
the
more
to
concentrate
the
snugness
of
being
in
bed
because
no
man
can
ever
feel
his
own
identity
aright
except
his
eyes
be
closed
as
if
darkness
were
indeed
the
proper
element
of
our
essences
though
light
be
more
congenial
to
our
clayey
part
upon
opening
my
eyes
then
and
coming
out
of
my
own
pleasant
and
self-created
darkness
into
the
imposed
and
coarse
outer
gloom
of
the
unilluminated
twelve-o’clock-at-night
i
experienced
a
disagreeable
revulsion
nor
did
i
at
all
object
to
the
hint
from
queequeg
that
perhaps
it
were
best
to
strike
a
light
seeing
that
we
were
so
wide
awake
and
besides
he
felt
a
strong
desire
to
have
a
few
quiet
puffs
from
his
tomahawk
be
it
said
that
though
i
had
felt
such
a
strong
repugnance
to
his
smoking
in
the
bed
the
night
before
yet
see
how
elastic
our
stiff
prejudices
grow
when
love
once
comes
to
bend
them
for
now
i
liked
nothing
better
than
to
have
queequeg
smoking
by
me
even
in
bed
because
he
seemed
to
be
full
of
such
serene
household
joy
then
i
no
more
felt
unduly
concerned
for
the
landlord’s
policy
of
insurance
i
was
only
alive
to
the
condensed
confidential
comfortableness
of
sharing
a
pipe
and
a
blanket
with
a
real
friend
with
our
shaggy
jackets
drawn
about
our
shoulders
we
now
passed
the
tomahawk
from
one
to
the
other
till
slowly
there
grew
over
us
a
blue
hanging
tester
of
smoke
illuminated
by
the
flame
of
the
new-lit
lamp
whether
it
was
that
this
undulating
tester
rolled
the
savage
away
to
far
distant
scenes
i
know
not
but
he
now
spoke
of
his
native
island
and
eager
to
hear
his
history
i
begged
him
to
go
on
and
tell
it
he
gladly
complied
though
at
the
time
i
but
ill
comprehended
not
a
few
of
his
words
yet
subsequent
disclosures
when
i
had
become
more
familiar
with
his
broken
phraseology
now
enable
me
to
present
the
whole
story
such
as
it
may
prove
in
the
mere
skeleton
i
give
chapter
12
biographical
queequeg
was
a
native
of
rokovoko
an
island
far
away
to
the
west
and
south
it
is
not
down
in
any
map
true
places
never
are
when
a
new-hatched
savage
running
wild
about
his
native
woodlands
in
a
grass
clout
followed
by
the
nibbling
goats
as
if
he
were
a
green
sapling
even
then
in
queequeg’s
ambitious
soul
lurked
a
strong
desire
to
see
something
more
of
christendom
than
a
specimen
whaler
or
two
his
father
was
a
high
chief
a
king
his
uncle
a
high
priest
and
on
the
maternal
side
he
boasted
aunts
who
were
the
wives
of
unconquerable
warriors
there
was
excellent
blood
in
his
veins—royal
stuff
though
sadly
vitiated
i
fear
by
the
cannibal
propensity
he
nourished
in
his
untutored
youth
a
sag
harbor
ship
visited
his
father’s
bay
and
queequeg
sought
a
passage
to
christian
lands
but
the
ship
having
her
full
complement
of
seamen
spurned
his
suit
and
not
all
the
king
his
father’s
influence
could
prevail
but
queequeg
vowed
a
vow
alone
in
his
canoe
he
paddled
off
to
a
distant
strait
which
he
knew
the
ship
must
pass
through
when
she
quitted
the
island
on
one
side
was
a
coral
reef
on
the
other
a
low
tongue
of
land
covered
with
mangrove
thickets
that
grew
out
into
the
water
hiding
his
canoe
still
afloat
among
these
thickets
with
its
prow
seaward
he
sat
down
in
the
stern
paddle
low
in
hand
and
when
the
ship
was
gliding
by
like
a
flash
he
darted
out
gained
her
side
with
one
backward
dash
of
his
foot
capsized
and
sank
his
canoe
climbed
up
the
chains
and
throwing
himself
at
full
length
upon
the
deck
grappled
a
ring-bolt
there
and
swore
not
to
let
it
go
though
hacked
in
pieces
in
vain
the
captain
threatened
to
throw
him
overboard
suspended
a
cutlass
over
his
naked
wrists
queequeg
was
the
son
of
a
king
and
queequeg
budged
not
struck
by
his
desperate
dauntlessness
and
his
wild
desire
to
visit
christendom
the
captain
at
last
relented
and
told
him
he
might
make
himself
at
home
but
this
fine
young
savage—this
sea
prince
of
wales
never
saw
the
captain’s
cabin
they
put
him
down
among
the
sailors
and
made
a
whaleman
of
him
but
like
czar
peter
content
to
toil
in
the
shipyards
of
foreign
cities
queequeg
disdained
no
seeming
ignominy
if
thereby
he
might
happily
gain
the
power
of
enlightening
his
untutored
countrymen
for
at
bottom—so
he
told
me—he
was
actuated
by
a
profound
desire
to
learn
among
the
christians
the
arts
whereby
to
make
his
people
still
happier
than
they
were
and
more
than
that
still
better
than
they
were
but
alas
the
practices
of
whalemen
soon
convinced
him
that
even
christians
could
be
both
miserable
and
wicked
infinitely
more
so
than
all
his
father’s
heathens
arrived
at
last
in
old
sag
harbor
and
seeing
what
the
sailors
did
there
and
then
going
on
to
nantucket
and
seeing
how
they
spent
their
wages
in
_that_
place
also
poor
queequeg
gave
it
up
for
lost
thought
he
it’s
a
wicked
world
in
all
meridians
i’ll
die
a
pagan
and
thus
an
old
idolator
at
heart
he
yet
lived
among
these
christians
wore
their
clothes
and
tried
to
talk
their
gibberish
hence
the
queer
ways
about
him
though
now
some
time
from
home
by
hints
i
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
propose
going
back
and
having
a
coronation
since
he
might
now
consider
his
father
dead
and
gone
he
being
very
old
and
feeble
at
the
last
accounts
he
answered
no
not
yet
and
added
that
he
was
fearful
christianity
or
rather
christians
had
unfitted
him
for
ascending
the
pure
and
undefiled
throne
of
thirty
pagan
kings
before
him
but
by
and
by
he
said
he
would
return,—as
soon
as
he
felt
himself
baptized
again
for
the
nonce
however
he
proposed
to
sail
about
and
sow
his
wild
oats
in
all
four
oceans
they
had
made
a
harpooneer
of
him
and
that
barbed
iron
was
in
lieu
of
a
sceptre
now
i
asked
him
what
might
be
his
immediate
purpose
touching
his
future
movements
he
answered
to
go
to
sea
again
in
his
old
vocation
upon
this
i
told
him
that
whaling
was
my
own
design
and
informed
him
of
my
intention
to
sail
out
of
nantucket
as
being
the
most
promising
port
for
an
adventurous
whaleman
to
embark
from
he
at
once
resolved
to
accompany
me
to
that
island
ship
aboard
the
same
vessel
get
into
the
same
watch
the
same
boat
the
same
mess
with
me
in
short
to
share
my
every
hap
with
both
my
hands
in
his
boldly
dip
into
the
potluck
of
both
worlds
to
all
this
i
joyously
assented
for
besides
the
affection
i
now
felt
for
queequeg
he
was
an
experienced
harpooneer
and
as
such
could
not
fail
to
be
of
great
usefulness
to
one
who
like
me
was
wholly
ignorant
of
the
mysteries
of
whaling
though
well
acquainted
with
the
sea
as
known
to
merchant
seamen
his
story
being
ended
with
his
pipe’s
last
dying
puff
queequeg
embraced
me
pressed
his
forehead
against
mine
and

out
the
light
we
rolled
over

other

wheelbarrow
next
morning
monday
after
disposing
of
the
embalmed
head
to
a
barber
for
a
block
i
settled
my
own
and
comrade’s
bill
using
however
my
comrade’s
money
the
grinning
landlord
as
well
as
the
boarders
seemed
amazingly
tickled
at
the
sudden
friendship
which
had
sprung
up
between
me
and
queequeg—especially
as
peter
coffin’s
cock
and
bull
stories
about
him
had
previously
so
much
alarmed
me
concerning
the
very
person
whom
i
now
companied
with
we
borrowed
a
wheelbarrow
and
embarking
our
things
including
my
own
poor
carpet-bag
and
queequeg’s
canvas
sack
and
hammock
away
we
went
down
to
“the
moss,”
the
little
nantucket
packet
schooner
moored
at
the
wharf
as
we
were
going
along
the
people
stared
not
at
queequeg
so
much—for
they
were
used
to
seeing
cannibals
like
him
in
their
streets,—but
at
seeing
him
and
me
upon
such
confidential
terms
but
we
heeded
them
not
going
along
wheeling
the
barrow
by
turns
and
queequeg
now
and
then
stopping
to
adjust
the
sheath
on
his
harpoon
barbs
i
asked
him
why
he
carried
such
a
troublesome
thing
with
him
ashore
and
whether
all
whaling
ships
did
not
find
their
own
harpoons
to
this
in
substance
he
replied
that
though
what
i
hinted
was
true
enough
yet
he
had
a
particular
affection
for
his
own
harpoon
because
it
was
of
assured
stuff
well
tried
in
many
a
mortal
combat
and
deeply
intimate
with
the
hearts
of
whales
in
short
like
many
inland
reapers
and
mowers
who
go
into
the
farmers’
meadows
armed
with
their
own
scythes—though
in
no
wise
obliged
to
furnish
them—even
so
queequeg
for
his
own
private
reasons
preferred
his
own
harpoon
shifting
the
barrow
from
my
hand
to
his
he
told
me
a
funny
story
about
the
first
wheelbarrow
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
in
sag
harbor
the
owners
of
his
ship
it
seems
had
lent
him
one
in
which
to
carry
his
heavy
chest
to
his
boarding
house
not
to
seem
ignorant
about
the
thing—though
in
truth
he
was
entirely
so
concerning
the
precise
way
in
which
to
manage
the
barrow—queequeg
puts
his
chest
upon
it
lashes
it
fast
and
then
shoulders
the
barrow
and
marches
up
the
wharf
“why,”
said
i
“queequeg
you
might
have
known
better
than
that
one
would
think
didn’t
the
people
laugh?”
upon
this
he
told
me
another
story
the
people
of
his
island
of
rokovoko
it
seems
at
their
wedding
feasts
express
the
fragrant
water
of
young
cocoanuts
into
a
large
stained
calabash
like
a
punchbowl
and
this
punchbowl
always
forms
the
great
central
ornament
on
the
braided
mat
where
the
feast
is
held
now
a
certain
grand
merchant
ship
once
touched
at
rokovoko
and
its
commander—from
all
accounts
a
very
stately
punctilious
gentleman
at
least
for
a
sea
captain—this
commander
was
invited
to
the
wedding
feast
of
queequeg’s
sister
a
pretty
young
princess
just
turned
of
ten
well
when
all
the
wedding
guests
were
assembled
at
the
bride’s
bamboo
cottage
this
captain
marches
in
and
being
assigned
the
post
of
honor
placed
himself
over
against
the
punchbowl
and
between
the
high
priest
and
his
majesty
the
king
queequeg’s
father
grace
being
said,—for
those
people
have
their
grace
as
well
as
we—though
queequeg
told
me
that
unlike
us
who
at
such
times
look
downwards
to
our
platters
they
on
the
contrary
copying
the
ducks
glance
upwards
to
the
great
giver
of
all
feasts—grace
i
say
being
said
the
high
priest
opens
the
banquet
by
the
immemorial
ceremony
of
the
island
that
is
dipping
his
consecrated
and
consecrating
fingers
into
the
bowl
before
the
blessed
beverage
circulates
seeing
himself
placed
next
the
priest
and
noting
the
ceremony
and
thinking
himself—being
captain
of
a
ship—as
having
plain
precedence
over
a
mere
island
king
especially
in
the
king’s
own
house—the
captain
coolly
proceeds
to
wash
his
hands
in
the
punchbowl;—taking
it
i
suppose
for
a
huge
finger-glass
“now,”
said
queequeg
“what
you
tink
now?—didn’t
our
people
laugh?”
at
last
passage
paid
and
luggage
safe
we
stood
on
board
the
schooner
hoisting
sail
it
glided
down
the
acushnet
river
on
one
side
new
bedford
rose
in
terraces
of
streets
their
ice-covered
trees
all
glittering
in
the
clear
cold
air
huge
hills
and
mountains
of
casks
on
casks
were
piled
upon
her
wharves
and
side
by
side
the
world-wandering
whale
ships
lay
silent
and
safely
moored
at
last
while
from
others
came
a
sound
of
carpenters
and
coopers
with
blended
noises
of
fires
and
forges
to
melt
the
pitch
all
betokening
that
new
cruises
were
on
the
start
that
one
most
perilous
and
long
voyage
ended
only
begins
a
second
and
a
second
ended
only
begins
a
third
and
so
on
for
ever
and
for
aye
such
is
the
endlessness
yea
the
intolerableness
of
all
earthly
effort
gaining
the
more
open
water
the
bracing
breeze
waxed
fresh
the
little
moss
tossed
the
quick
foam
from
her
bows
as
a
young
colt
his
snortings
how
i
snuffed
that
tartar
air!—how
i
spurned
that
turnpike
earth!—that
common
highway
all
over
dented
with
the
marks
of
slavish
heels
and
hoofs
and
turned
me
to
admire
the
magnanimity
of
the
sea
which
will
permit
no
records
at
the
same
foam-fountain
queequeg
seemed
to
drink
and
reel
with
me
his
dusky
nostrils
swelled
apart
he
showed
his
filed
and
pointed
teeth
on
on
we
flew
and
our
offing
gained
the
moss
did
homage
to
the
blast
ducked
and
dived
her
bows
as
a
slave
before
the
sultan
sideways
leaning
we
sideways
darted
every
ropeyarn
tingling
like
a
wire
the
two
tall
masts
buckling
like
indian
canes
in
land
tornadoes
so
full
of
this
reeling
scene
were
we
as
we
stood
by
the
plunging
bowsprit
that
for
some
time
we
did
not
notice
the
jeering
glances
of
the
passengers
a
lubber-like
assembly
who
marvelled
that
two
fellow
beings
should
be
so
companionable
as
though
a
white
man
were
anything
more
dignified
than
a
whitewashed
negro
but
there
were
some
boobies
and
bumpkins
there
who
by
their
intense
greenness
must
have
come
from
the
heart
and
centre
of
all
verdure
queequeg
caught
one
of
these
young
saplings
mimicking
him
behind
his
back
i
thought
the
bumpkin’s
hour
of
doom
was
come
dropping
his
harpoon
the
brawny
savage
caught
him
in
his
arms
and
by
an
almost
miraculous
dexterity
and
strength
sent
him
high
up
bodily
into
the
air
then
slightly
tapping
his
stern
in
mid-somerset
the
fellow
landed
with
bursting
lungs
upon
his
feet
while
queequeg
turning
his
back
upon
him
lighted
his
tomahawk
pipe
and
passed
it
to
me
for
a
puff
“capting
capting!”
yelled
the
bumpkin
running
towards
that
officer
“capting
capting
here’s
the
devil.”
“hallo
_you_
sir,”
cried
the
captain
a
gaunt
rib
of
the
sea
stalking
up
to
queequeg
“what
in
thunder
do
you
mean
by
that
don’t
you
know
you
might
have
killed
that
chap?”
“what
him
say?”
said
queequeg
as
he
mildly
turned
to
me
“he
say,”
said
i
“that
you
came
near
kill-e
that
man
there,”
pointing
to
the
still
shivering
greenhorn
“kill-e,”
cried
queequeg
twisting
his
tattooed
face
into
an
unearthly
expression
of
disdain
“ah
him
bevy
small-e
fish-e
queequeg
no
kill-e
so
small-e
fish-e
queequeg
kill-e
big
whale!”
“look
you,”
roared
the
captain
“i’ll
kill-e
_you_
you
cannibal
if
you
try
any
more
of
your
tricks
aboard
here
so
mind
your
eye.”
but
it
so
happened
just
then
that
it
was
high
time
for
the
captain
to
mind
his
own
eye
the
prodigious
strain
upon
the
main-sail
had
parted
the
weather-sheet
and
the
tremendous
boom
was
now
flying
from
side
to
side
completely
sweeping
the
entire
after
part
of
the
deck
the
poor
fellow
whom
queequeg
had
handled
so
roughly
was
swept
overboard
all
hands
were
in
a
panic
and
to
attempt
snatching
at
the
boom
to
stay
it
seemed
madness
it
flew
from
right
to
left
and
back
again
almost
in
one
ticking
of
a
watch
and
every
instant
seemed
on
the
point
of
snapping
into
splinters
nothing
was
done
and
nothing
seemed
capable
of
being
done
those
on
deck
rushed
towards
the
bows
and
stood
eyeing
the
boom
as
if
it
were
the
lower
jaw
of
an
exasperated
whale
in
the
midst
of
this
consternation
queequeg
dropped
deftly
to
his
knees
and
crawling
under
the
path
of
the
boom
whipped
hold
of
a
rope
secured
one
end
to
the
bulwarks
and
then
flinging
the
other
like
a
lasso
caught
it
round
the
boom
as
it
swept
over
his
head
and
at
the
next
jerk
the
spar
was
that
way
trapped
and
all
was
safe
the
schooner
was
run
into
the
wind
and
while
the
hands
were
clearing
away
the
stern
boat
queequeg
stripped
to
the
waist
darted
from
the
side
with
a
long
living
arc
of
a
leap
for
three
minutes
or
more
he
was
seen
swimming
like
a
dog
throwing
his
long
arms
straight
out
before
him
and
by
turns
revealing
his
brawny
shoulders
through
the
freezing
foam
i
looked
at
the
grand
and
glorious
fellow
but
saw
no
one
to
be
saved
the
greenhorn
had
gone
down
shooting
himself
perpendicularly
from
the
water
queequeg
now
took
an
instant’s
glance
around
him
and
seeming
to
see
just
how
matters
were
dived
down
and
disappeared
a
few
minutes
more
and
he
rose
again
one
arm
still
striking
out
and
with
the
other
dragging
a
lifeless
form
the
boat
soon
picked
them
up
the
poor
bumpkin
was
restored
all
hands
voted
queequeg
a
noble
trump
the
captain
begged
his
pardon
from
that
hour
i
clove
to
queequeg
like
a
barnacle
yea
till
poor
queequeg
took
his
last
long
dive
was
there
ever
such
unconsciousness
he
did
not
seem
to
think
that
he
at
all
deserved
a
medal
from
the
humane
and
magnanimous
societies
he
only
asked
for
water—fresh
water—something
to
wipe
the
brine
off
that
done
he
put
on
dry
clothes
lighted
his
pipe
and
leaning
against
the
bulwarks
and
mildly
eyeing
those
around
him
seemed
to
be
saying
to
himself—“it’s
a
mutual
joint-stock
world
in
all
meridians
we
cannibals
must
help
these
christians.”

nantucket
nothing
more
happened
on
the
passage
worthy
the
mentioning
so
after
a
fine
run
we
safely
arrived
in
nantucket
nantucket
take
out
your
map
and
look
at
it
see
what
a
real
corner
of
the
world
it
occupies
how
it
stands
there
away
off
shore
more
lonely
than
the
eddystone
lighthouse
look
at
it—a
mere
hillock
and
elbow
of
sand
all
beach
without
a
background
there
is
more
sand
there
than
you
would
use
in
twenty
years
as
a
substitute
for
blotting
paper
some
gamesome
wights
will
tell
you
that
they
have
to
plant
weeds
there
they
don’t
grow
naturally
that
they
import
canada
thistles
that
they
have
to
send
beyond
seas
for
a
spile
to
stop
a
leak
in
an
oil
cask
that
pieces
of
wood
in
nantucket
are
carried
about
like
bits
of
the
true
cross
in
rome
that
people
there
plant
toadstools
before
their
houses
to
get
under
the
shade
in
summer
time
that
one
blade
of
grass
makes
an
oasis
three
blades
in
a
day’s
walk
a
prairie
that
they
wear
quicksand
shoes
something
like
laplander
snow-shoes
that
they
are
so
shut
up
belted
about
every
way
inclosed
surrounded
and
made
an
utter
island
of
by
the
ocean
that
to
their
very
chairs
and
tables
small
clams
will
sometimes
be
found
adhering
as
to
the
backs
of
sea
turtles
but
these
extravaganzas
only
show
that
nantucket
is
no
illinois
look
now
at
the
wondrous
traditional
story
of
how
this
island
was
settled
by
the
red-men
thus
goes
the
legend
in
olden
times
an
eagle
swooped
down
upon
the
new
england
coast
and
carried
off
an
infant
indian
in
his
talons
with
loud
lament
the
parents
saw
their
child
borne
out
of
sight
over
the
wide
waters
they
resolved
to
follow
in
the
same
direction
setting
out
in
their
canoes
after
a
perilous
passage
they
discovered
the
island
and
there
they
found
an
empty
ivory
casket,—the
poor
little
indian’s
skeleton
what
wonder
then
that
these
nantucketers
born
on
a
beach
should
take
to
the
sea
for
a
livelihood
they
first
caught
crabs
and
quohogs
in
the
sand
grown
bolder
they
waded
out
with
nets
for
mackerel
more
experienced
they
pushed
off
in
boats
and
captured
cod
and
at
last
launching
a
navy
of
great
ships
on
the
sea
explored
this
watery
world
put
an
incessant
belt
of
circumnavigations
round
it
peeped
in
at
behring’s
straits
and
in
all
seasons
and
all
oceans
declared
everlasting
war
with
the
mightiest
animated
mass
that
has
survived
the
flood
most
monstrous
and
most
mountainous
that
himmalehan
salt-sea
mastodon
clothed
with
such
portentousness
of
unconscious
power
that
his
very
panics
are
more
to
be
dreaded
than
his
most
fearless
and
malicious
assaults
and
thus
have
these
naked
nantucketers
these
sea
hermits
issuing
from
their
ant-hill
in
the
sea
overrun
and
conquered
the
watery
world
like
so
many
alexanders
parcelling
out
among
them
the
atlantic
pacific
and
indian
oceans
as
the
three
pirate
powers
did
poland
let
america
add
mexico
to
texas
and
pile
cuba
upon

let
the
english
overswarm
all
india
and
hang
out
their
blazing
banner
from
the
sun
two
thirds
of
this
terraqueous
globe
are
the
nantucketer’s
for
the
sea
is
his
he
owns
it
as

own

other

but
a
right
of

through

bridges
armed

even

though
following
the
sea
as
highwaymen
the
road
they
but
plunder
other
ships
other
fragments
of
the
land
like
themselves
without
seeking
to
draw
their
living
from
the
bottomless
deep
itself
the
nantucketer
he
alone
resides
and
riots
on
the
sea
he
alone
in
bible
language
goes
down
to
it
in
ships
to
and
fro
ploughing
it
as
his
own
special
plantation
_there_
is
his
home
_there_
lies
his
business
which
a
noah’s
flood
would
not
interrupt
though
it
overwhelmed
all
the
millions
in
china
he
lives
on
the
sea
as
prairie
cocks
in
the
prairie
he
hides
among
the
waves
he
climbs
them
as
chamois
hunters
climb
the
alps
for
years
he
knows
not
the
land
so
that
when
he
comes
to
it
at
last
it
smells
like
another
world
more
strangely
than
the
moon
would
to
an
earthsman
with
the
landless
gull
that
at
sunset
folds
her
wings
and
is
rocked
to
sleep
between
billows
so
at
nightfall
the
nantucketer
out
of
sight
of
land
furls
his
sails
and
lays
him
to
his
rest
while
under
his
very
pillow
rush
herds
of
walruses
and
whales

chowder
it
was
quite
late
in
the
evening
when
the
little
moss
came
snugly
to
anchor
and
queequeg
and
i
went
ashore
so
we
could
attend
to
no
business
that
day
at
least
none
but
a
supper
and
a
bed
the
landlord
of
the
spouter-inn
had
recommended
us
to
his
cousin
hosea
hussey
of
the
try
pots
whom
he
asserted
to
be
the
proprietor
of
one
of
the
best
kept
hotels
in
all
nantucket
and
moreover
he
had
assured
us
that
cousin
hosea
as
he
called
him
was
famous
for
his
chowders
in
short
he
plainly
hinted
that
we
could
not
possibly
do
better
than
try
pot-luck
at
the
try
pots
but
the
directions
he
had
given
us
about
keeping
a
yellow
warehouse
on
our
starboard
hand
till
we
opened
a
white
church
to
the
larboard
and
then
keeping
that
on
the
larboard
hand
till
we
made
a
corner
three
points
to
the
starboard
and
that
done
then
ask
the
first
man
we
met
where
the
place
was
these
crooked
directions
of
his
very
much
puzzled
us
at
first
especially
as
at
the
outset
queequeg
insisted
that
the
yellow
warehouse—our
first
point
of
departure—must
be
left
on
the
larboard
hand
whereas
i
had
understood
peter
coffin
to
say
it
was
on
the
starboard
however
by
dint
of
beating
about
a
little
in
the
dark
and
now
and
then
knocking
up
a
peaceable
inhabitant
to
inquire
the
way
we
at
last
came
to
something
which
there
was
no
mistaking
two
enormous
wooden
pots
painted
black
and
suspended
by
asses’
ears
swung
from
the
cross-trees
of
an
old
top-mast
planted
in
front
of
an
old
doorway
the
horns
of
the
cross-trees
were
sawed
off
on
the
other
side
so
that
this
old
top-mast
looked
not
a
little
like
a
gallows
perhaps
i
was
over
sensitive
to
such
impressions
at
the
time
but
i
could
not
help
staring
at
this
gallows
with
a
vague
misgiving
a
sort
of
crick
was
in
my
neck
as
i
gazed
up
to
the
two
remaining
horns
yes
_two_
of
them
one
for
queequeg
and
one
for
me
it’s
ominous
thinks
i
a
coffin
my
innkeeper
upon
landing
in
my
first
whaling
port
tombstones
staring
at
me
in
the
whalemen’s
chapel
and
here
a
gallows
and
a
pair
of
prodigious
black
pots
too
are
these
last
throwing
out
oblique
hints
touching
tophet
i
was
called
from
these
reflections
by
the
sight
of
a
freckled
woman
with
yellow
hair
and
a
yellow
gown
standing
in
the
porch
of
the
inn
under
a
dull
red
lamp
swinging
there
that
looked
much
like
an
injured
eye
and
carrying
on
a
brisk
scolding
with
a
man
in
a
purple
woollen
shirt
“get
along
with
ye,”
said
she
to
the
man
“or
i’ll
be
combing
ye!”
“come
on
queequeg,”
said
i
“all
right
there’s
mrs
hussey.”
and
so
it
turned
out
mr
hosea
hussey
being
from
home
but
leaving
mrs
hussey
entirely
competent
to
attend
to
all
his
affairs
upon
making
known
our
desires
for
a
supper
and
a
bed
mrs
hussey
postponing
further
scolding
for
the
present
ushered
us
into
a
little
room
and
seating
us
at
a
table
spread
with
the
relics
of
a
recently
concluded
repast
turned
round
to
us
and
said—“clam
or
cod?”
“what’s
that
about
cods
ma’am?”
said
i
with
much
politeness
“clam
or
cod?”
she
repeated
“a
clam
for
supper
a
cold
clam
is
_that_
what
you
mean
mrs
hussey?”
says
i
“but
that’s
a
rather
cold
and
clammy
reception
in
the
winter
time
ain’t
it
mrs
hussey?”
but
being
in
a
great
hurry
to
resume
scolding
the
man
in
the
purple
shirt
who
was
waiting
for
it
in
the
entry
and
seeming
to
hear
nothing
but
the
word
“clam,”
mrs
hussey
hurried
towards
an
open
door
leading
to
the
kitchen
and
bawling
out
“clam
for
two,”
disappeared
“queequeg,”
said
i
“do
you
think
that
we
can
make
out
a
supper
for
us
both
on
one
clam?”
however
a
warm
savory
steam
from
the
kitchen
served
to
belie
the
apparently
cheerless
prospect
before
us
but
when
that
smoking
chowder
came
in
the
mystery
was
delightfully
explained
oh
sweet
friends
hearken
to
me
it
was
made
of
small
juicy
clams
scarcely
bigger
than
hazel
nuts
mixed
with
pounded
ship
biscuit
and
salted
pork
cut
up
into
little
flakes
the
whole
enriched
with
butter
and
plentifully
seasoned
with
pepper
and
salt
our
appetites
being
sharpened
by
the
frosty
voyage
and
in
particular
queequeg
seeing
his
favourite
fishing
food
before
him
and
the
chowder
being
surpassingly
excellent
we
despatched
it
with
great
expedition
when
leaning
back
a
moment
and
bethinking
me
of
mrs
hussey’s
clam
and
cod
announcement
i
thought
i
would
try
a
little
experiment
stepping
to
the
kitchen
door
i
uttered
the
word
“cod”
with
great
emphasis
and
resumed
my
seat
in
a
few
moments
the
savoury
steam
came
forth
again
but
with
a
different
flavor
and
in
good
time
a
fine
cod-chowder
was
placed
before
us
we
resumed
business
and
while
plying
our
spoons
in
the
bowl
thinks
i
to
myself
i
wonder
now
if
this
here
has
any
effect
on
the
head
what’s
that
stultifying
saying
about
chowder-headed
people
“but
look
queequeg
ain’t
that
a
live
eel
in
your
bowl
where’s
your
harpoon?”
fishiest
of
all
fishy
places
was
the
try
pots
which
well
deserved
its
name
for
the
pots
there
were
always
boiling
chowders
chowder
for
breakfast
and
chowder
for
dinner
and
chowder
for
supper
till
you
began
to
look
for
fish-bones
coming
through
your
clothes
the
area
before
the
house
was
paved
with
clam-shells
mrs
hussey
wore
a
polished
necklace
of
codfish
vertebra
and
hosea
hussey
had
his
account
books
bound
in
superior
old
shark-skin
there
was
a
fishy
flavor
to
the
milk
too
which
i
could
not
at
all
account
for
till
one
morning
happening
to
take
a
stroll
along
the
beach
among
some
fishermen’s
boats
i
saw
hosea’s
brindled
cow
feeding
on
fish
remnants
and
marching
along
the
sand
with
each
foot
in
a
cod’s
decapitated
head
looking
very
slip-shod
i
assure
ye
supper
concluded
we
received
a
lamp
and
directions
from
mrs
hussey
concerning
the
nearest
way
to
bed
but
as
queequeg
was
about
to
precede
me
up
the
stairs
the
lady
reached
forth
her
arm
and
demanded
his
harpoon
she
allowed
no
harpoon
in
her
chambers
“why
not?”
said
i
“every
true
whaleman
sleeps
with
his
harpoon—but
why
not?”
“because
it’s
dangerous,”
says
she
“ever
since
young
stiggs
coming
from
that
unfort’nt
v’y’ge
of
his
when
he
was
gone
four
years
and
a
half
with
only
three
barrels
of
_ile_
was
found
dead
in
my
first
floor
back
with
his
harpoon
in
his
side
ever
since
then
i
allow
no
boarders
to
take
sich
dangerous
weepons
in
their
rooms
at
night
so
mr
queequeg”
for
she
had
learned
his
name
“i
will
just
take
this
here
iron
and
keep
it
for
you
till
morning
but
the
chowder
clam
or
cod
to-morrow
for
breakfast
men?”
“both,”
says
i
“and
let’s
have
a
couple
of
smoked
herring
by
way
of
variety.”
chapter
16
the
ship
in
bed
we
concocted
our
plans
for
the
morrow
but
to
my
surprise
and
no
small
concern
queequeg
now
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
had
been
diligently
consulting
yojo—the
name
of
his
black
little
god—and
yojo
had
told
him
two
or
three
times
over
and
strongly
insisted
upon
it
everyway
that
instead
of
our
going
together
among
the
whaling-fleet
in
harbor
and
in
concert
selecting
our
craft
instead
of
this
i
say
yojo
earnestly
enjoined
that
the
selection
of
the
ship
should
rest
wholly
with
me
inasmuch
as
yojo
purposed
befriending
us
and
in
order
to
do
so
had
already
pitched
upon
a
vessel
which
if
left
to
myself
i
ishmael
should
infallibly
light
upon
for
all
the
world
as
though
it
had
turned
out
by
chance
and
in
that
vessel
i
must
immediately
ship
myself
for
the
present
irrespective
of
queequeg
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
that
in
many
things
queequeg
placed
great
confidence
in
the
excellence
of
yojo’s
judgment
and
surprising
forecast
of
things
and
cherished
yojo
with
considerable
esteem
as
a
rather
good
sort
of
god
who
perhaps
meant
well
enough
upon
the
whole
but
in
all
cases
did
not
succeed
in
his
benevolent
designs
now
this
plan
of
queequeg’s
or
rather
yojo’s
touching
the
selection
of
our
craft
i
did
not
like
that
plan
at
all
i
had
not
a
little
relied
upon
queequeg’s
sagacity
to
point
out
the
whaler
best
fitted
to
carry
us
and
our
fortunes
securely
but
as
all
my
remonstrances
produced
no
effect
upon
queequeg
i
was
obliged
to
acquiesce
and
accordingly
prepared
to
set
about
this
business
with
a
determined
rushing
sort
of
energy
and
vigor
that
should
quickly
settle
that
trifling
little
affair
next
morning
early
leaving
queequeg
shut
up
with
yojo
in
our
little
bedroom—for
it
seemed
that
it
was
some
sort
of
lent
or
ramadan
or
day
of
fasting
humiliation
and
prayer
with
queequeg
and
yojo
that
day
_how_
it
was
i
never
could
find
out
for
though
i
applied
myself
to
it
several
times
i
never
could
master
his
liturgies
and
xxxix
articles—leaving
queequeg
then
fasting
on
his
tomahawk
pipe
and
yojo
warming
himself
at
his
sacrificial
fire
of
shavings
i
sallied
out
among
the
shipping
after
much
prolonged
sauntering
and
many
random
inquiries
i
learnt
that
there
were
three
ships
up
for
three-years’
voyages—the
devil-dam
the
tit-bit
and
the
pequod
_devil-dam_
i
do
not
know
the
origin
of
_tit-bit_
is
obvious
_pequod_
you
will
no
doubt
remember
was
the
name
of
a
celebrated
tribe
of
massachusetts
indians
now
extinct
as
the
ancient
medes
i
peered
and
pryed
about
the
devil-dam
from
her
hopped
over
to
the
tit-bit
and
finally
going
on
board
the
pequod
looked
around
her
for
a
moment
and
then
decided
that
this
was
the
very
ship
for
us
you
may
have
seen
many
a
quaint
craft
in
your
day
for
aught
i
know;—square-toed
luggers
mountainous
japanese
junks
butter-box
galliots
and
what
not
but
take
my
word
for
it
you
never
saw
such
a
rare
old
craft
as
this
same
rare
old
pequod
she
was
a
ship
of
the
old
school
rather
small
if
anything
with
an
old-fashioned
claw-footed
look
about
her
long
seasoned
and
weather-stained
in
the
typhoons
and
calms
of
all
four
oceans
her
old
hull’s
complexion
was
darkened
like
a
french
grenadier’s
who
has
alike
fought
in
egypt
and
siberia
her
venerable
bows
looked
bearded
her
masts—cut
somewhere
on
the
coast
of
japan
where
her
original
ones
were
lost
overboard
in
a
gale—her
masts
stood
stiffly
up
like
the
spines
of
the
three
old
kings
of
cologne
her
ancient
decks
were
worn
and
wrinkled
like
the
pilgrim-worshipped
flag-stone
in
canterbury
cathedral
where
becket
bled
but
to
all
these
her
old
antiquities
were
added
new
and
marvellous
features
pertaining
to
the
wild
business
that
for
more
than
half
a
century
she
had
followed
old
captain
peleg
many
years
her
chief-mate
before
he
commanded
another
vessel
of
his
own
and
now
a
retired
seaman
and
one
of
the
principal
owners
of
the
pequod,—this
old
peleg
during
the
term
of
his
chief-mateship
had
built
upon
her
original
grotesqueness
and
inlaid
it
all
over
with
a
quaintness
both
of
material
and
device
unmatched
by
anything
except
it
be
thorkill-hake’s
carved
buckler
or
bedstead
she
was
apparelled
like
any
barbaric
ethiopian
emperor
his
neck
heavy
with
pendants
of
polished
ivory
she
was
a
thing
of
trophies
a
cannibal
of
a
craft
tricking
herself
forth
in
the
chased
bones
of
her
enemies
all
round
her
unpanelled
open
bulwarks
were
garnished
like
one
continuous
jaw
with
the
long
sharp
teeth
of
the
sperm
whale
inserted
there
for
pins
to
fasten
her
old
hempen
thews
and
tendons
to
those
thews
ran
not
through
base
blocks
of
land
wood
but
deftly
travelled
over
sheaves
of
sea-ivory
scorning
a
turnstile
wheel
at
her
reverend
helm
she
sported
there
a
tiller
and
that
tiller
was
in
one
mass
curiously
carved
from
the
long
narrow
lower
jaw
of
her
hereditary
foe
the
helmsman
who
steered
by
that
tiller
in
a
tempest
felt
like
the
tartar
when
he
holds
back
his
fiery
steed
by
clutching
its
jaw
a
noble
craft
but
somehow
a
most
melancholy
all
noble
things
are
touched
with
that
now
when
i
looked
about
the
quarter-deck
for
some
one
having
authority
in
order
to
propose
myself
as
a
candidate
for
the
voyage
at
first
i
saw
nobody
but
i
could
not
well
overlook
a
strange
sort
of
tent
or
rather
wigwam
pitched
a
little
behind
the
main-mast
it
seemed
only
a
temporary
erection
used
in
port
it
was
of
a
conical
shape
some
ten
feet
high
consisting
of
the
long
huge
slabs
of
limber
black
bone
taken
from
the
middle
and
highest
part
of
the
jaws
of
the
right-whale
planted
with
their
broad
ends
on
the
deck
a
circle
of
these
slabs
laced
together
mutually
sloped
towards
each
other
and
at
the
apex
united
in
a
tufted
point
where
the
loose
hairy
fibres
waved
to
and
fro
like
the
top-knot
on
some
old
pottowottamie
sachem’s
head
a
triangular
opening
faced
towards
the
bows
of
the
ship
so
that
the
insider
commanded
a
complete
view
forward
and
half
concealed
in
this
queer
tenement
i
at
length
found
one
who
by
his
aspect
seemed
to
have
authority
and
who
it
being
noon
and
the
ship’s
work
suspended
was
now
enjoying
respite
from
the
burden
of
command
he
was
seated
on
an
old-fashioned
oaken
chair
wriggling
all
over
with
curious
carving
and
the
bottom
of
which
was
formed
of
a
stout
interlacing
of
the
same
elastic
stuff
of
which
the
wigwam
was
constructed
there
was
nothing
so
very
particular
perhaps
about
the
appearance
of
the
elderly
man
i
saw
he
was
brown
and
brawny
like
most
old
seamen
and
heavily
rolled
up
in
blue
pilot-cloth
cut
in
the
quaker
style
only
there
was
a
fine
and
almost
microscopic
net-work
of
the
minutest
wrinkles
interlacing
round
his
eyes
which
must
have
arisen
from
his
continual
sailings
in
many
hard
gales
and
always
looking
to
windward;—for
this
causes
the
muscles
about
the
eyes
to
become
pursed
together
such
eye-wrinkles
are
very
effectual
in
a
scowl
“is
this
the
captain
of
the
pequod?”
said
i
advancing
to
the
door
of
the
tent
“supposing
it
be
the
captain
of
the
pequod
what
dost
thou
want
of
him?”
he
demanded
“i
was
thinking
of
shipping.”
“thou
wast
wast
thou
i
see
thou
art
no
nantucketer—ever
been
in
a
stove
boat?”
“no
sir
i
never
have.”
“dost
know
nothing
at
all
about
whaling
i
dare
say—eh
“nothing
sir
but
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
soon
learn
i’ve
been
several
voyages
in
the
merchant
service
and
i
think
that—”
“merchant
service
be
damned
talk
not
that
lingo
to
me
dost
see
that
leg?—i’ll
take
that
leg
away
from
thy
stern
if
ever
thou
talkest
of
the
marchant
service
to
me
again
marchant
service
indeed
i
suppose
now
ye
feel
considerable
proud
of
having
served
in
those
marchant
ships
but
flukes
man
what
makes
thee
want
to
go
a
whaling
eh?—it
looks
a
little
suspicious
don’t
it
eh?—hast
not
been
a
pirate
hast
thou?—didst
not
rob
thy
last
captain
didst
thou?—dost
not
think
of
murdering
the
officers
when
thou
gettest
to
sea?”
i
protested
my
innocence
of
these
things
i
saw
that
under
the
mask
of
these
half
humorous
innuendoes
this
old
seaman
as
an
insulated
quakerish
nantucketer
was
full
of
his
insular
prejudices
and
rather
distrustful
of
all
aliens
unless
they
hailed
from
cape
cod
or
the
vineyard
“but
what
takes
thee
a-whaling
i
want
to
know
that
before
i
think
of
shipping
ye.”
“well
sir
i
want
to
see
what
whaling
is
i
want
to
see
the
world.”
“want
to
see
what
whaling
is
eh
have
ye
clapped
eye
on
captain
ahab?”
“who
is
captain
ahab
sir?”
“aye
aye
i
thought
so
captain
ahab
is
the
captain
of
this
ship.”
“i
am
mistaken
then
i
thought
i
was
speaking
to
the
captain
himself.”
“thou
art
speaking
to
captain
peleg—that’s
who
ye
are
speaking
to
young
man
it
belongs
to
me
and
captain
bildad
to
see
the
pequod
fitted
out
for
the
voyage
and
supplied
with
all
her
needs
including
crew
we
are
part
owners
and
agents
but
as
i
was
going
to
say
if
thou
wantest
to
know
what
whaling
is
as
thou
tellest
ye
do
i
can
put
ye
in
a
way
of
finding
it
out
before
ye
bind
yourself
to
it
past
backing
out
clap
eye
on
captain
ahab
young
man
and
thou
wilt
find
that
he
has
only
one
leg.”
“what
do
you
mean
sir
was
the
other
one
lost
by
a
whale?”
“lost
by
a
whale
young
man
come
nearer
to
me
it
was
devoured
chewed
up
crunched
by
the
monstrousest
parmacetty
that
ever
chipped
a
boat!—ah
ah!”
i
was
a
little
alarmed
by
his
energy
perhaps
also
a
little
touched
at
the
hearty
grief
in
his
concluding
exclamation
but
said
as
calmly
as
i
could
“what
you
say
is
no
doubt
true
enough
sir
but
how
could
i
know
there
was
any
peculiar
ferocity
in
that
particular
whale
though
indeed
i
might
have
inferred
as
much
from
the
simple
fact
of
the
accident.”
“look
ye
now
young
man
thy
lungs
are
a
sort
of
soft
d’ye
see
thou
dost
not
talk
shark
a
bit
_sure_
ye’ve
been
to
sea
before
now
sure
of
that?”
“sir,”
said
i
“i
thought
i
told
you
that
i
had
been
four
voyages
in
the
merchant—”
“hard
down
out
of
that
mind
what
i
said
about
the
marchant
service—don’t
aggravate
me—i
won’t
have
it
but
let
us
understand
each
other
i
have
given
thee
a
hint
about
what
whaling
is
do
ye
yet
feel
inclined
for
it?”
“i
do
sir.”
“very
good
now
art
thou
the
man
to
pitch
a
harpoon
down
a
live
whale’s
throat
and
then
jump
after
it
answer
quick!”
“i
am
sir
if
it
should
be
positively
indispensable
to
do
so
not
to
be
got
rid
of
that
is
which
i
don’t
take
to
be
the
fact.”
“good
again
now
then
thou
not
only
wantest
to
go
a-whaling
to
find
out
by
experience
what
whaling
is
but
ye
also
want
to
go
in
order
to
see
the
world
was
not
that
what
ye
said
i
thought
so
well
then
just
step
forward
there
and
take
a
peep
over
the
weather-bow
and
then
back
to
me
and
tell
me
what
ye
see
there.”
for
a
moment
i
stood
a
little
puzzled
by
this
curious
request
not
knowing
exactly
how
to
take
it
whether
humorously
or
in
earnest
but
concentrating
all
his
crow’s
feet
into
one
scowl
captain
peleg
started
me
on
the
errand
going
forward
and
glancing
over
the
weather
bow
i
perceived
that
the
ship
swinging
to
her
anchor
with
the
flood-tide
was
now
obliquely
pointing
towards
the
open
ocean
the
prospect
was
unlimited
but
exceedingly
monotonous
and
forbidding
not
the
slightest
variety
that
i
could
see
“well
what’s
the
report?”
said
peleg
when
i
came
back
“what
did
ye
see?”
“not
much,”
i
replied—“nothing
but
water
considerable
horizon
though
and
there’s
a
squall
coming
up
i
think.”
“well
what
does
thou
think
then
of
seeing
the
world
do
ye
wish
to
go
round
cape
horn
to
see
any
more
of
it
eh
can’t
ye
see
the
world
where
you
stand?”
i
was
a
little
staggered
but
go
a-whaling
i
must
and
i
would
and
the
pequod
was
as
good
a
ship
as
any—i
thought
the
best—and
all
this
i
now
repeated
to
peleg
seeing
me
so
determined
he
expressed
his
willingness
to
ship
me
“and
thou
mayest
as
well
sign
the
papers
right
off,”
he
added—“come
along
with
ye.”
and
so
saying
he
led
the
way
below
deck
into
the
cabin
seated
on
the
transom
was
what
seemed
to
me
a
most
uncommon
and
surprising
figure
it
turned
out
to
be
captain
bildad
who
along
with
captain
peleg
was
one
of
the
largest
owners
of
the
vessel
the
other
shares
as
is
sometimes
the
case
in
these
ports
being
held
by
a
crowd
of
old
annuitants
widows
fatherless
children
and
chancery
wards
each
owning
about
the
value
of
a
timber
head
or
a
foot
of
plank
or
a
nail
or
two
in
the
ship
people
in
nantucket
invest
their
money
in
whaling
vessels
the
same
way
that
you
do
yours
in
approved
state
stocks
bringing
in
good
interest
now
bildad
like
peleg
and
indeed
many
other
nantucketers
was
a
quaker
the
island
having
been
originally
settled
by
that
sect
and
to
this
day
its
inhabitants
in
general
retain
in
an
uncommon
measure
the
peculiarities
of
the
quaker
only
variously
and
anomalously
modified
by
things
altogether
alien
and
heterogeneous
for
some
of
these
same
quakers
are
the
most
sanguinary
of
all
sailors
and
whale-hunters
they
are
fighting
quakers
they
are
quakers
with
a
vengeance
so
that
there
are
instances
among
them
of
men
who
named
with
scripture
names—a
singularly
common
fashion
on
the
island—and
in
childhood
naturally
imbibing
the
stately
dramatic
thee
and
thou
of
the
quaker
idiom
still
from
the
audacious
daring
and
boundless
adventure
of
their
subsequent
lives
strangely
blend
with
these
unoutgrown
peculiarities
a
thousand
bold
dashes
of
character
not
unworthy
a
scandinavian
sea-king
or
a
poetical
pagan
roman
and
when
these
things
unite
in
a
man
of
greatly
superior
natural
force
with
a
globular
brain
and
a
ponderous
heart
who
has
also
by
the
stillness
and
seclusion
of
many
long
night-watches
in
the
remotest
waters
and
beneath
constellations
never
seen
here
at
the
north
been
led
to
think
untraditionally
and
independently
receiving
all
nature’s
sweet
or
savage
impressions
fresh
from
her
own
virgin
voluntary
and
confiding
breast
and
thereby
chiefly
but
with
some
help
from
accidental
advantages
to
learn
a
bold
and
nervous
lofty
language—that
man
makes
one
in
a
whole
nation’s
census—a
mighty
pageant
creature
formed
for
noble
tragedies
nor
will
it
at
all
detract
from
him
dramatically
regarded
if
either
by
birth
or
other
circumstances
he
have
what
seems
a
half
wilful
overruling
morbidness
at
the
bottom
of
his
nature
for
all
men
tragically
great
are
made
so
through
a
certain
morbidness
be
sure
of
this
o
young
ambition
all
mortal
greatness
is
but
disease
but
as
yet
we
have
not
to
do
with
such
an
one
but
with
quite
another
and
still
a
man
who
if
indeed
peculiar
it
only
results
again
from
another
phase
of
the
quaker
modified
by
individual
circumstances
like
captain
peleg
captain
bildad
was
a
well-to-do
retired
whaleman
but
unlike
captain
peleg—who
cared
not
a
rush
for
what
are
called
serious
things
and
indeed
deemed
those
self-same
serious
things
the
veriest
of
all
trifles—captain
bildad
had
not
only
been
originally
educated
according
to
the
strictest
sect
of
nantucket
quakerism
but
all
his
subsequent
ocean
life
and
the
sight
of
many
unclad
lovely
island
creatures
round
the
horn—all
that
had
not
moved
this
native
born
quaker
one
single
jot
had
not
so
much
as
altered
one
angle
of
his
vest
still
for
all
this
immutableness
was
there
some
lack
of
common
consistency
about
worthy
captain
bildad
though
refusing
from
conscientious
scruples
to
bear
arms
against
land
invaders
yet
himself
had
illimitably
invaded
the
atlantic
and
pacific
and
though
a
sworn
foe
to
human
bloodshed
yet
had
he
in
his
straight-bodied
coat
spilled
tuns
upon
tuns
of
leviathan
gore
how
now
in
the
contemplative
evening
of
his
days
the
pious
bildad
reconciled
these
things
in
the
reminiscence
i
do
not
know
but
it
did
not
seem
to
concern
him
much
and
very
probably
he
had
long
since
come
to
the
sage
and
sensible
conclusion
that
a
man’s
religion
is
one
thing
and
this
practical
world
quite
another
this
world
pays
dividends
rising
from
a
little
cabin-boy
in
short
clothes
of
the
drabbest
drab
to
a
harpooneer
in
a
broad
shad-bellied
waistcoat
from
that
becoming
boat-header
chief-mate
and
captain
and
finally
a
ship
owner
bildad
as
i
hinted
before
had
concluded
his
adventurous
career
by
wholly
retiring
from
active
life
at
the
goodly
age
of
sixty
and
dedicating
his
remaining
days
to
the
quiet
receiving
of
his
well-earned
income
now
bildad
i
am
sorry
to
say
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
incorrigible
old
hunks
and
in
his
sea-going
days
a
bitter
hard
task-master
they
told
me
in
nantucket
though
it
certainly
seems
a
curious
story
that
when
he
sailed
the
old
categut
whaleman
his
crew
upon
arriving
home
were
mostly
all
carried
ashore
to
the
hospital
sore
exhausted
and
worn
out
for
a
pious
man
especially
for
a
quaker
he
was
certainly
rather
hard-hearted
to
say
the
least
he
never
used
to
swear
though
at
his
men
they
said
but
somehow
he
got
an
inordinate
quantity
of
cruel
unmitigated
hard
work
out
of
them
when
bildad
was
a
chief-mate
to
have
his
drab-coloured
eye
intently
looking
at
you
made
you
feel
completely
nervous
till
you
could
clutch
something—a
hammer
or
a
marling-spike
and
go
to
work
like
mad
at
something
or
other
never
mind
what
indolence
and
idleness
perished
before
him
his
own
person
was
the
exact
embodiment
of
his
utilitarian
character
on
his
long
gaunt
body
he
carried
no
spare
flesh
no
superfluous
beard
his
chin
having
a
soft
economical
nap
to
it
like
the
worn
nap
of
his
broad-brimmed
hat
such
then
was
the
person
that
i
saw
seated
on
the
transom
when
i
followed
captain
peleg
down
into
the
cabin
the
space
between
the
decks
was
small
and
there
bolt-upright
sat
old
bildad
who
always
sat
so
and
never
leaned
and
this
to
save
his
coat
tails
his
broad-brim
was
placed
beside
him
his
legs
were
stiffly
crossed
his
drab
vesture
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
and
spectacles
on
nose
he
seemed
absorbed
in
reading
from
a
ponderous
volume
“bildad,”
cried
captain
peleg
“at
it
again
bildad
eh
ye
have
been
studying
those
scriptures
now
for
the
last
thirty
years
to
my
certain
knowledge
how
far
ye
got
bildad?”
as
if
long
habituated
to
such
profane
talk
from
his
old
shipmate
bildad
without
noticing
his
present
irreverence
quietly
looked
up
and
seeing
me
glanced
again
inquiringly
towards
peleg
“he
says
he’s
our
man
bildad,”
said
peleg
“he
wants
to
ship.”
“dost
thee?”
said
bildad
in
a
hollow
tone
and
turning
round
to
me
“i
_dost_,”
said
i
unconsciously
he
was
so
intense
a
quaker
“what
do
ye
think
of
him
bildad?”
said
peleg
“he’ll
do,”
said
bildad
eyeing
me
and
then
went
on
spelling
away
at
his
book
in
a
mumbling
tone
quite
audible
i
thought
him
the
queerest
old
quaker
i
ever
saw
especially
as
peleg
his
friend
and
old
shipmate
seemed
such
a
blusterer
but
i
said
nothing
only
looking
round
me
sharply
peleg
now
threw
open
a
chest
and
drawing
forth
the
ship’s
articles
placed
pen
and
ink
before
him
and
seated
himself
at
a
little
table
i
began
to
think
it
was
high
time
to
settle
with
myself
at
what
terms
i
would
be
willing
to
engage
for
the
voyage
i
was
already
aware
that
in
the
whaling
business
they
paid
no
wages
but
all
hands
including
the
captain
received
certain
shares
of
the
profits
called
_lays_
and
that
these
lays
were
proportioned
to
the
degree
of
importance
pertaining
to
the
respective
duties
of
the
ship’s
company
i
was
also
aware
that
being
a
green
hand
at
whaling
my
own
lay
would
not
be
very
large
but
considering
that
i
was
used
to
the
sea
could
steer
a
ship
splice
a
rope
and
all
that
i
made
no
doubt
that
from
all
i
had
heard
i
should
be
offered
at
least
the
275th
lay—that
is
the
275th
part
of
the
clear
net
proceeds
of
the
voyage
whatever
that
might
eventually
amount
to
and
though
the
275th
lay
was
what
they
call
a
rather
_long
lay_
yet
it
was
better
than
nothing
and
if
we
had
a
lucky
voyage
might
pretty
nearly
pay
for
the
clothing
i
would
wear
out
on
it
not
to
speak
of
my
three
years’
beef
and
board
for
which
i
would
not
have
to
pay
one
stiver
it
might
be
thought
that
this
was
a
poor
way
to
accumulate
a
princely
fortune—and
so
it
was
a
very
poor
way
indeed
but
i
am
one
of
those
that
never
take
on
about
princely
fortunes
and
am
quite
content
if
the
world
is
ready
to
board
and
lodge
me
while
i
am
putting
up
at
this
grim
sign
of
the
thunder
cloud
upon
the
whole
i
thought
that
the
275th
lay
would
be
about
the
fair
thing
but
would
not
have
been
surprised
had
i
been
offered
the
200th
considering
i
was
of
a
broad-shouldered
make
but
one
thing
nevertheless
that
made
me
a
little
distrustful
about
receiving
a
generous
share
of
the
profits
was
this
ashore
i
had
heard
something
of
both
captain
peleg
and
his
unaccountable
old
crony
bildad
how
that
they
being
the
principal
proprietors
of
the
pequod
therefore
the
other
and
more
inconsiderable
and
scattered
owners
left
nearly
the
whole
management
of
the
ship’s
affairs
to
these
two
and
i
did
not
know
but
what
the
stingy
old
bildad
might
have
a
mighty
deal
to
say
about
shipping
hands
especially
as
i
now
found
him
on
board
the
pequod
quite
at
home
there
in
the
cabin
and
reading
his
bible
as
if
at
his
own
fireside
now
while
peleg
was
vainly
trying
to
mend
a
pen
with
his
jack-knife
old
bildad
to
my
no
small
surprise
considering
that
he
was
such
an
interested
party
in
these
proceedings
bildad
never
heeded
us
but
went
on
mumbling
to
himself
out
of
his
book
“_lay_
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
upon
earth
where
moth—”
“well
captain
bildad,”
interrupted
peleg
“what
d’ye
say
what
lay
shall
we
give
this
young
man?”
“thou
knowest
best,”
was
the
sepulchral
reply
“the
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
wouldn’t
be
too
much
would
it?—‘where
moth
and
rust
do
corrupt
but
_lay_—’”
_lay_
indeed
thought
i
and
such
a
lay
the
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
well
old
bildad
you
are
determined
that
i
for
one
shall
not
_lay_
up
many
_lays_
here
below
where
moth
and
rust
do
corrupt
it
was
an
exceedingly
_long
lay_
that
indeed
and
though
from
the
magnitude
of
the
figure
it
might
at
first
deceive
a
landsman
yet
the
slightest
consideration
will
show
that
though
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seven
is
a
pretty
large
number
yet
when
you
come
to
make
a
_teenth_
of
it
you
will
then
see
i
say
that
the
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
part
of
a
farthing
is
a
good
deal
less
than
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seven
gold
doubloons
and
so
i
thought
at
the
time
“why
blast
your
eyes
bildad,”
cried
peleg
“thou
dost
not
want
to
swindle
this
young
man
he
must
have
more
than
that.”
“seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh,”
again
said
bildad
without
lifting
his
eyes
and
then
went
on
mumbling—“for
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also.”
“i
am
going
to
put
him
down
for
the
three
hundredth,”
said
peleg
“do
ye
hear
that
bildad
the
three
hundredth
lay
i
say.”
bildad
laid
down
his
book
and
turning
solemnly
towards
him
said
“captain
peleg
thou
hast
a
generous
heart
but
thou
must
consider
the
duty
thou
owest
to
the
other
owners
of
this
ship—widows
and
orphans
many
of
them—and
that
if
we
too
abundantly
reward
the
labors
of
this
young
man
we
may
be
taking
the
bread
from
those
widows
and
those
orphans
the
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
lay
captain
peleg.”
“thou
bildad!”
roared
peleg
starting
up
and
clattering
about
the
cabin
“blast
ye
captain
bildad
if
i
had
followed
thy
advice
in
these
matters
i
would
afore
now
had
a
conscience
to
lug
about
that
would
be
heavy
enough
to
founder
the
largest
ship
that
ever
sailed
round
cape
horn.”
“captain
peleg,”
said
bildad
steadily
“thy
conscience
may
be
drawing
ten
inches
of
water
or
ten
fathoms
i
can’t
tell
but
as
thou
art
still
an
impenitent
man
captain
peleg
i
greatly
fear
lest
thy
conscience
be
but
a
leaky
one
and
will
in
the
end
sink
thee
foundering
down
to
the
fiery
pit
captain
peleg.”
“fiery
pit
fiery
pit
ye
insult
me
man
past
all
natural
bearing
ye
insult
me
it’s
an
all-fired
outrage
to
tell
any
human
creature
that
he’s
bound
to
hell
flukes
and
flames
bildad
say
that
again
to
me
and
start
my
soul-bolts
but
i’ll—i’ll—yes
i’ll
swallow
a
live
goat
with
all
his
hair
and
horns
on
out
of
the
cabin
ye
canting
drab-coloured
son
of
a
wooden
gun—a
straight
wake
with
ye!”
as
he
thundered
out
this
he
made
a
rush
at
bildad
but
with
a
marvellous
oblique
sliding
celerity
bildad
for
that
time
eluded
him
alarmed
at
this
terrible
outburst
between
the
two
principal
and
responsible
owners
of
the
ship
and
feeling
half
a
mind
to
give
up
all
idea
of
sailing
in
a
vessel
so
questionably
owned
and
temporarily
commanded
i
stepped
aside
from
the
door
to
give
egress
to
bildad
who
i
made
no
doubt
was
all
eagerness
to
vanish
from
before
the
awakened
wrath
of
peleg
but
to
my
astonishment
he
sat
down
again
on
the
transom
very
quietly
and
seemed
to
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
withdrawing
he
seemed
quite
used
to
impenitent
peleg
and
his
ways
as
for
peleg
after
letting
off
his
rage
as
he
had
there
seemed
no
more
left
in
him
and
he
too
sat
down
like
a
lamb
though
he
twitched
a
little
as
if
still
nervously
agitated
“whew!”
he
whistled
at
last—“the
squall’s
gone
off
to
leeward
i
think
bildad
thou
used
to
be
good
at
sharpening
a
lance
mend
that
pen
will
ye
my
jack-knife
here
needs
the
grindstone
that’s
he
thank
ye
bildad
now
then
my
young
man
ishmael’s
thy
name
didn’t
ye
say
well
then
down
ye
go
here
ishmael
for
the
three
hundredth
lay.”
“captain
peleg,”
said
i
“i
have
a
friend
with
me
who
wants
to
ship
too—shall
i
bring
him
down
to-morrow?”
“to
be
sure,”
said
peleg
“fetch
him
along
and
we’ll
look
at
him.”
“what
lay
does
he
want?”
groaned
bildad
glancing
up
from
the
book
in
which
he
had
again
been
burying
himself
“oh
never
thee
mind
about
that
bildad,”
said
peleg
“has
he
ever
whaled
it
any?”
turning
to
me
“killed
more
whales
than
i
can
count
captain
peleg.”
“well
bring
him
along
then.”
and
after
signing
the
papers
off
i
went
nothing
doubting
but
that
i
had
done
a
good
morning’s
work
and
that
the
pequod
was
the
identical
ship
that
yojo
had
provided
to
carry
queequeg
and
me
round
the
cape
but
i
had
not
proceeded
far
when
i
began
to
bethink
me
that
the
captain
with
whom
i
was
to
sail
yet
remained
unseen
by
me
though
indeed
in
many
cases
a
whale-ship
will
be
completely
fitted
out
and
receive
all
her
crew
on
board
ere
the
captain
makes
himself
visible
by
arriving
to
take
command
for
sometimes
these
voyages
are
so
prolonged
and
the
shore
intervals
at
home
so
exceedingly
brief
that
if
the
captain
have
a
family
or
any
absorbing
concernment
of
that
sort
he
does
not
trouble
himself
much
about
his
ship
in
port
but
leaves
her
to
the
owners
till
all
is
ready
for
sea
however
it
is
always
as
well
to
have
a
look
at
him
before
irrevocably
committing
yourself
into
his
hands
turning
back
i
accosted
captain
peleg
inquiring
where
captain
ahab
was
to
be
found
“and
what
dost
thou
want
of
captain
ahab
it’s
all
right
enough
thou
art
shipped.”
“yes
but
i
should
like
to
see
him.”
“but
i
don’t
think
thou
wilt
be
able
to
at
present
i
don’t
know
exactly
what’s
the
matter
with
him
but
he
keeps
close
inside
the
house
a
sort
of
sick
and
yet
he
don’t
look
so
in
fact
he
ain’t
sick
but
no
he
isn’t
well
either
any
how
young
man
he
won’t
always
see
me
so
i
don’t
suppose
he
will
thee
he’s
a
queer
man
captain
ahab—so
some
think—but
a
good
one
oh
thou’lt
like
him
well
enough
no
fear
no
fear
he’s
a
grand
ungodly
god-like
man
captain
ahab
doesn’t
speak
much
but
when
he
does
speak
then
you
may
well
listen
mark
ye
be
forewarned
ahab’s
above
the
common
ahab’s
been
in
colleges
as
well
as
’mong
the
cannibals
been
used
to
deeper
wonders
than
the
waves
fixed
his
fiery
lance
in
mightier
stranger
foes
than
whales
his
lance
aye
the
keenest
and
the
surest
that
out
of
all
our
isle
oh
he
ain’t
captain
bildad
no
and
he
ain’t
captain
peleg
_he’s
ahab_
boy
and
ahab
of
old
thou
knowest
was
a
crowned
king!”
“and
a
very
vile
one
when
that
wicked
king
was
slain
the
dogs
did
they
not
lick
his
blood?”
“come
hither
to
me—hither
hither,”
said
peleg
with
a
significance
in
his
eye
that
almost
startled
me
“look
ye
lad
never
say
that
on
board
the
pequod
never
say
it
anywhere
captain
ahab
did
not
name
himself
’twas
a
foolish
ignorant
whim
of
his
crazy
widowed
mother
who
died
when
he
was
only
a
twelvemonth
old
and
yet
the
old
squaw
tistig
at
gayhead
said
that
the
name
would
somehow
prove
prophetic
and
perhaps
other
fools
like
her
may
tell
thee
the
same
i
wish
to
warn
thee
it’s
a
lie
i
know
captain
ahab
well
i’ve
sailed
with
him
as
mate
years
ago
i
know
what
he
is—a
good
man—not
a
pious
good
man
like
bildad
but
a
swearing
good
man—something
like
me—only
there’s
a
good
deal
more
of
him
aye
aye
i
know
that
he
was
never
very
jolly
and
i
know
that
on
the
passage
home
he
was
a
little
out
of
his
mind
for
a
spell
but
it
was
the
sharp
shooting
pains
in
his
bleeding
stump
that
brought
that
about
as
any
one
might
see
i
know
too
that
ever
since
he
lost
his
leg
last
voyage
by
that
accursed
whale
he’s
been
a
kind
of
moody—desperate
moody
and
savage
sometimes
but
that
will
all
pass
off
and
once
for
all
let
me
tell
thee
and
assure
thee
young
man
it’s
better
to
sail
with
a
moody
good
captain
than
a
laughing
bad
one
so
good-bye
to
thee—and
wrong
not
captain
ahab
because
he
happens
to
have
a
wicked
name
besides
my
boy
he
has
a
wife—not
three
voyages
wedded—a
sweet
resigned
girl
think
of
that
by
that
sweet
girl
that
old
man
has
a
child
hold
ye
then
there
can
be
any
utter
hopeless
harm
in
ahab
no
no
my
lad
stricken
blasted
if
he
be
ahab
has
his
humanities!”
as
i
walked
away
i
was
full
of
thoughtfulness
what
had
been
incidentally
revealed
to
me
of
captain
ahab
filled
me
with
a
certain
wild
vagueness
of
painfulness
concerning
him
and
somehow
at
the
time
i
felt
a
sympathy
and
a
sorrow
for
him
but
for
i
don’t
know
what
unless
it
was
the
cruel
loss
of
his
leg
and
yet
i
also
felt
a
strange
awe
of
him
but
that
sort
of
awe
which
i
cannot
at
all
describe
was
not
exactly
awe
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
but
i
felt
it
and
it
did
not
disincline
me
towards
him
though
i
felt
impatience
at
what
seemed
like
mystery
in
him
so
imperfectly
as
he
was
known
to
me
then
however
my
thoughts
were
at
length
carried
in
other
directions
so
that
for
the
present
dark
ahab
slipped
my
mind
chapter
17
the
ramadan
as
queequeg’s
ramadan
or
fasting
and
humiliation
was
to
continue
all
day
i
did
not
choose
to
disturb
him
till
towards
night-fall
for
i
cherish
the
greatest
respect
towards
everybody’s
religious
obligations
never
mind
how
comical
and
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
undervalue
even
a
congregation
of
ants
worshipping
a
toad-stool
or
those
other
creatures
in
certain
parts
of
our
earth
who
with
a
degree
of
footmanism
quite
unprecedented
in
other
planets
bow
down
before
the
torso
of
a
deceased
landed
proprietor
merely
on
account
of
the
inordinate
possessions
yet
owned
and
rented
in
his
name
i
say
we
good
presbyterian
christians
should
be
charitable
in
these
things
and
not
fancy
ourselves
so
vastly
superior
to
other
mortals
pagans
and
what
not
because
of
their
half-crazy
conceits
on
these
subjects
there
was
queequeg
now
certainly
entertaining
the
most
absurd
notions
about
yojo
and
his
ramadan;—but
what
of
that
queequeg
thought
he
knew
what
he
was
about
i
suppose
he
seemed
to
be
content
and
there
let
him
rest
all
our
arguing
with
him
would
not
avail
let
him
be
i
say
and
heaven
have
mercy
on
us
all—presbyterians
and
pagans
alike—for
we
are
all
somehow
dreadfully
cracked
about
the
head
and
sadly
need
mending
towards
evening
when
i
felt
assured
that
all
his
performances
and
rituals
must
be
over
i
went
up
to
his
room
and
knocked
at
the
door
but
no
answer
i
tried
to
open
it
but
it
was
fastened
inside
“queequeg,”
said
i
softly
through
the
key-hole:—all
silent
“i
say
queequeg
why
don’t
you
speak
it’s
i—ishmael.”
but
all
remained
still
as
before
i
began
to
grow
alarmed
i
had
allowed
him
such
abundant
time
i
thought
he
might
have
had
an
apoplectic
fit
i
looked
through
the
key-hole
but
the
door
opening
into
an
odd
corner
of
the
room
the
key-hole
prospect
was
but
a
crooked
and
sinister
one
i
could
only
see
part
of
the
foot-board
of
the
bed
and
a
line
of
the
wall
but
nothing
more
i
was
surprised
to
behold
resting
against
the
wall
the
wooden
shaft
of
queequeg’s
harpoon
which
the
landlady
the
evening
previous
had
taken
from
him
before
our
mounting
to
the
chamber
that’s
strange
thought
i
but
at
any
rate
since
the
harpoon
stands
yonder
and
he
seldom
or
never
goes
abroad
without
it
therefore
he
must
be
inside
here
and
no
possible
mistake
“queequeg!—queequeg!”—all
still
something
must
have
happened
apoplexy
i
tried
to
burst
open
the
door
but
it
stubbornly
resisted
running
down
stairs
i
quickly
stated
my
suspicions
to
the
first
person
i
met—the
chamber-maid
“la
la!”
she
cried
“i
thought
something
must
be
the
matter
i
went
to
make
the
bed
after
breakfast
and
the
door
was
locked
and
not
a
mouse
to
be
heard
and
it’s
been
just
so
silent
ever
since
but
i
thought
may
be
you
had
both
gone
off
and
locked
your
baggage
in
for
safe
keeping
la
la
ma’am!—mistress
murder
mrs
hussey
apoplexy!”—and
with
these
cries
she
ran
towards
the
kitchen
i
following
mrs
hussey
soon
appeared
with
a
mustard-pot
in
one
hand
and
a
vinegar-cruet
in
the
other
having
just
broken
away
from
the
occupation
of
attending
to
the
castors
and
scolding
her
little
black
boy
meantime
“wood-house!”
cried
i
“which
way
to
it
run
for
god’s
sake
and
fetch
something
to
pry
open
the
door—the
axe!—the
axe
he’s
had
a
stroke
depend
upon
it!”—and
so
saying
i
was
unmethodically
rushing
up
stairs
again
empty-handed
when
mrs
hussey
interposed
the
mustard-pot
and
vinegar-cruet
and
the
entire
castor
of
her
countenance
“what’s
the
matter
with
you
young
man?”
“get
the
axe
for
god’s
sake
run
for
the
doctor
some
one
while
i
pry
it
open!”
“look
here,”
said
the
landlady
quickly
putting
down
the
vinegar-cruet
so
as
to
have
one
hand
free
“look
here
are
you
talking
about
prying
open
any
of
my
doors?”—and
with
that
she
seized
my
arm
“what’s
the
matter
with
you
what’s
the
matter
with
you
shipmate?”
in
as
calm
but
rapid
a
manner
as
possible
i
gave
her
to
understand
the
whole
case
unconsciously
clapping
the
vinegar-cruet
to
one
side
of
her
nose
she
ruminated
for
an
instant
then
exclaimed—“no
i
haven’t
seen
it
since
i
put
it
there.”
running
to
a
little
closet
under
the
landing
of
the
stairs
she
glanced
in
and
returning
told
me
that
queequeg’s
harpoon
was
missing
“he’s
killed
himself,”
she
cried
“it’s
unfort’nate
stiggs
done
over
again—there
goes
another
counterpane—god
pity
his
poor
mother!—it
will
be
the
ruin
of
my
house
has
the
poor
lad
a
sister
where’s
that
girl?—there
betty
go
to
snarles
the
painter
and
tell
him
to
paint
me
a
sign
with—“no
suicides
permitted
here
and
no
smoking
in
the
parlor;”—might
as
well
kill
both
birds
at
once
kill
the
lord
be
merciful
to
his
ghost
what’s
that
noise
there
you
young
man
avast
there!”
and
running
up
after
me
she
caught
me
as
i
was
again
trying
to
force
open
the
door
“i
don’t
allow
it
i
won’t
have
my
premises
spoiled
go
for
the
locksmith
there’s
one
about
a
mile
from
here
but
avast!”
putting
her
hand
in
her
side-pocket
“here’s
a
key
that’ll
fit
i
guess
let’s
see.”
and
with
that
she
turned
it
in
the
lock
but
alas
queequeg’s
supplemental
bolt
remained
unwithdrawn
within
“have
to
burst
it
open,”
said
i
and
was
running
down
the
entry
a
little
for
a
good
start
when
the
landlady
caught
at
me
again
vowing
i
should
not
break
down
her
premises
but
i
tore
from
her
and
with
a
sudden
bodily
rush
dashed
myself
full
against
the
mark
with
a
prodigious
noise
the
door
flew
open
and
the
knob
slamming
against
the
wall
sent
the
plaster
to
the
ceiling
and
there
good
heavens
there
sat
queequeg
altogether
cool
and
self-collected
right
in
the
middle
of
the
room
squatting
on
his
hams
and
holding
yojo
on
top
of
his
head
he
looked
neither
one
way
nor
the
other
way
but
sat
like
a
carved
image
with
scarce
a
sign
of
active
life
“queequeg,”
said
i
going
up
to
him
“queequeg
what’s
the
matter
with
you?”
“he
hain’t
been
a
sittin’
so
all
day
has
he?”
said
the
landlady
but
all
we
said
not
a
word
could
we
drag
out
of
him
i
almost
felt
like
pushing
him
over
so
as
to
change
his
position
for
it
was
almost
intolerable
it
seemed
so
painfully
and
unnaturally
constrained
especially
as
in
all
probability
he
had
been
sitting
so
for
upwards
of
eight
or
ten
hours
going
too
without
his
regular
meals
“mrs
hussey,”
said
i
“he’s
_alive_
at
all
events
so
leave
us
if
you
please
and
i
will
see
to
this
strange
affair
myself.”
closing
the
door
upon
the
landlady
i
endeavored
to
prevail
upon
queequeg
to
take
a
chair
but
in
vain
there
he
sat
and
all
he
could
do—for
all
my
polite
arts
and
blandishments—he
would
not
move
a
peg
nor
say
a
single
word
nor
even
look
at
me
nor
notice
my
presence
in
the
slightest
way
i
wonder
thought
i
if
this
can
possibly
be
a
part
of
his
ramadan
do
they
fast
on
their
hams
that
way
in
his
native
island
it
must
be
so
yes
it’s
part
of
his
creed
i
suppose
well
then
let
him
rest
he’ll
get
up
sooner
or
later
no
doubt
it
can’t
last
for
ever
thank
god
and
his
ramadan
only
comes
once
a
year
and
i
don’t
believe
it’s
very
punctual
then
i
went
down
to
supper
after
sitting
a
long
time
listening
to
the
long
stories
of
some
sailors
who
had
just
come
from
a
plum-pudding
voyage
as
they
called
it
that
is
a
short
whaling-voyage
in
a
schooner
or
brig
confined
to
the
north
of
the
line
in
the
atlantic
ocean
only
after
listening
to
these
plum-puddingers
till
nearly
eleven
o’clock
i
went
up
stairs
to
go
to
bed
feeling
quite
sure
by
this
time
queequeg
must
certainly
have
brought
his
ramadan
to
a
termination
but
no
there
he
was
just
where
i
had
left
him
he
had
not
stirred
an
inch
i
began
to
grow
vexed
with
him
it
seemed
so
downright
senseless
and
insane
to
be
sitting
there
all
day
and
half
the
night
on
his
hams
in
a
cold
room
holding
a
piece
of
wood
on
his
head
“for
heaven’s
sake
queequeg
get
up
and
shake
yourself
get
up
and
have
some
supper
you’ll
starve
you’ll
kill
yourself
queequeg.”
but
not
a
word
did
he
reply
despairing
of
him
therefore
i
determined
to
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
and
no
doubt
before
a
great
while
he
would
follow
me
but
previous
to
turning
in
i
took
my
heavy
bearskin
jacket
and
threw
it
over
him
as
it
promised
to
be
a
very
cold
night
and
he
had
nothing
but
his
ordinary
round
jacket
on
for
some
time
do
all
i
would
i
could
not
get
into
the
faintest
doze
i
had
blown
out
the
candle
and
the
mere
thought
of
queequeg—not
four
feet
off—sitting
there
in
that
uneasy
position
stark
alone
in
the
cold
and
dark
this
made
me
really
wretched
think
of
it
sleeping
all
night
in
the
same
room
with
a
wide
awake
pagan
on
his
hams
in
this
dreary
unaccountable
ramadan
but
somehow
i
dropped
off
at
last
and
knew
nothing
more
till
break
of
day
when
looking
over
the
bedside
there
squatted
queequeg
as
if
he
had
been
screwed
down
to
the
floor
but
as
soon
as
the
first
glimpse
of
sun
entered
the
window
up
he
got
with
stiff
and
grating
joints
but
with
a
cheerful
look
limped
towards
me
where
i
lay
pressed
his
forehead
again
against
mine
and
said
his
ramadan
was
over
now
as
i
before
hinted
i
have
no
objection
to
any
person’s
religion
be
it
what
it
may
so
long
as
that
person
does
not
kill
or
insult
any
other
person
because
that
other
person
don’t
believe
it
also
but
when
a
man’s
religion
becomes
really
frantic
when
it
is
a
positive
torment
to
him
and
in
fine
makes
this
earth
of
ours
an
uncomfortable
inn
to
lodge
in
then
i
think
it
high
time
to
take
that
individual
aside
and
argue
the
point
with
him
and
just
so
i
now
did
with
queequeg
“queequeg,”
said
i
“get
into
bed
now
and
lie
and
listen
to
me.”
i
then
went
on
beginning
with
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
primitive
religions
and
coming
down
to
the
various
religions
of
the
present
time
during
which
time
i
labored
to
show
queequeg
that
all
these
lents
ramadans
and
prolonged
ham-squattings
in
cold
cheerless
rooms
were
stark
nonsense
bad
for
the
health
useless
for
the
soul
opposed
in
short
to
the
obvious
laws
of
hygiene
and
common
sense
i
told
him
too
that
he
being
in
other
things
such
an
extremely
sensible
and
sagacious
savage
it
pained
me
very
badly
pained
me
to
see
him
now
so
deplorably
foolish
about
this
ridiculous
ramadan
of
his
besides
argued
i
fasting
makes
the
body
cave
in
hence
the
spirit
caves
in
and
all
thoughts
born
of
a
fast
must
necessarily
be
half-starved
this
is
the
reason
why
most
dyspeptic
religionists
cherish
such
melancholy
notions
about
their
hereafters
in
one
word
queequeg
said
i
rather
digressively
hell
is
an
idea
first
born
on
an
undigested
apple-dumpling
and
since
then
perpetuated
through
the
hereditary
dyspepsias
nurtured
by
ramadans
i
then
asked
queequeg
whether
he
himself
was
ever
troubled
with
dyspepsia
expressing
the
idea
very
plainly
so
that
he
could
take
it
in
he
said
no
only
upon
one
memorable
occasion
it
was
after
a
great
feast
given
by
his
father
the
king
on
the
gaining
of
a
great
battle
wherein
fifty
of
the
enemy
had
been
killed
by
about
two
o’clock
in
the
afternoon
and
all
cooked
and
eaten
that
very
evening
“no
more
queequeg,”
said
i
shuddering
“that
will
do;”
for
i
knew
the
inferences
without
his
further
hinting
them
i
had
seen
a
sailor
who
had
visited
that
very
island
and
he
told
me
that
it
was
the
custom
when
a
great
battle
had
been
gained
there
to
barbecue
all
the
slain
in
the
yard
or
garden
of
the
victor
and
then
one
by
one
they
were
placed
in
great
wooden
trenchers
and
garnished
round
like
a
pilau
with
breadfruit
and
cocoanuts
and
with
some
parsley
in
their
mouths
were
sent
round
with
the
victor’s
compliments
to
all
his
friends
just
as
though
these
presents
were
so
many
christmas
turkeys
after
all
i
do
not
think
that
my
remarks
about
religion
made
much
impression
upon
queequeg
because
in
the
first
place
he
somehow
seemed
dull
of
hearing
on
that
important
subject
unless
considered
from
his
own
point
of
view
and
in
the
second
place
he
did
not
more
than
one
third
understand
me
couch
my
ideas
simply
as
i
would
and
finally
he
no
doubt
thought
he
knew
a
good
deal
more
about
the
true
religion
than
i
did
he
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
condescending
concern
and
compassion
as
though
he
thought
it
a
great
pity
that
such
a
sensible
young
man
should
be
so
hopelessly
lost
to
evangelical
pagan
piety
at
last
we
rose
and
dressed
and
queequeg
taking
a
prodigiously
hearty
breakfast
of
chowders
of
all
sorts
so
that
the
landlady
should
not
make
much
profit
by
reason
of
his
ramadan
we
sallied
out
to
board
the
pequod

along
and
picking
our
teeth

as
we
were
walking
down
the
end
of
the

towards
the
ship
queequeg
carrying
his
harpoon
captain
peleg
in
his
gruff
voice
loudly
hailed
us
from
his
wigwam
saying
he
had
not
suspected
my
friend
was
a
cannibal
and
furthermore
announcing
that
he
let
no
cannibals
on
board
that
craft
unless
they
previously
produced
their
papers
“what
do
you
mean
by
that
captain
peleg?”
said
i
now
jumping
on
the
bulwarks
and
leaving
my
comrade
standing
on
the
wharf
“i
mean,”
he
replied
“he
must
show
his
papers.”
“yes,”
said
captain
bildad
in
his
hollow
voice
sticking
his
head
from
behind
peleg’s
out
of
the
wigwam
“he
must
show
that
he’s
converted
son
of
darkness,”
he
added
turning
to
queequeg
“art
thou
at
present
in
communion
with
any
christian
church?”
“why,”
said
i
“he’s
a
member
of
the
first
congregational
church.”
here
be
it
said
that
many
tattooed
savages
sailing
in
nantucket
ships
at
last
come
to
be
converted
into
the
churches
“first
congregational
church,”
cried
bildad
“what
that
worships
in
deacon
deuteronomy
coleman’s
meeting-house?”
and
so
saying
taking
out
his
spectacles
he
rubbed
them
with
his
great
yellow
bandana
handkerchief
and
putting
them
on
very
carefully
came
out
of
the
wigwam
and
leaning
stiffly
over
the
bulwarks
took
a
good
long
look
at
queequeg
“how
long
hath
he
been
a
member?”
he
then
said
turning
to
me
“not
very
long
i
rather
guess
young
man.”
“no,”
said
peleg
“and
he
hasn’t
been
baptized
right
either
or
it
would
have
washed
some
of
that
devil’s
blue
off
his
face.”
“do
tell
now,”
cried
bildad
“is
this
philistine
a
regular
member
of
deacon
deuteronomy’s
meeting
i
never
saw
him
going
there
and
i
pass
it
every
lord’s
day.”
“i
don’t
know
anything
about
deacon
deuteronomy
or
his
meeting,”
said
i
“all
i
know
is
that
queequeg
here
is
a
born
member
of
the
first
congregational
church
he
is
a
deacon
himself
queequeg
is.”
“young
man,”
said
bildad
sternly
“thou
art
skylarking
with
me—explain
thyself
thou
young
hittite
what
church
dost
thee
mean
answer
me.”
finding
myself
thus
hard
pushed
i
replied
“i
mean
sir
the
same
ancient
catholic
church
to
which
you
and
i
and
captain
peleg
there
and
queequeg
here
and
all
of

only

some
queer
crotchets
no
ways
touching
the
grand
belief
in
_that_
we
all
join
hands.”
“splice
thou
mean’st
_splice_
hands,”
cried
peleg
drawing
nearer
“young
man
you’d
better
ship
for
a
missionary
instead
of
a
fore-mast
hand
i
never
heard
a
better
sermon

couldn’t
beat

and
he’s
reckoned

there—what’s
that
you
call

tell
quohog
to
step
along
by
the
great
anchor
what
a
harpoon
he’s
got
there
looks
like
good
stuff
that
and
he
handles
it
about
right
i
say
quohog
or
whatever
your
name
is
did
you
ever
stand
in
the
head
of
a
whale-boat
did
you
ever
strike
a
fish?”
without
saying
a
word
queequeg
in
his
wild
sort
of
way
jumped
upon
the
bulwarks
from
thence
into
the
bows
of
one
of
the
whale-boats
hanging
to
the
side
and
then
bracing
his
left
knee
and
poising
his
harpoon
cried
out
in
some
such
way
as
this:—
“cap’ain
you
see
him
small
drop
tar
on
water
dere
you
see
him
well
spose
him
one
whale
eye
well
den!”
and
taking
sharp
aim
at
it
he
darted
the
iron
right
over
old
bildad’s
broad
brim
clean
across
the
ship’s
decks
and
struck
the
glistening
tar
spot
out
of
sight
“now,”
said
queequeg
quietly
hauling
in
the
line
“spos-ee
him
whale-e
eye
why
dad
whale
dead.”
“quick
bildad,”
said
peleg
his
partner
who
aghast
at
the
close
vicinity
of
the
flying
harpoon
had
retreated
towards
the
cabin
gangway
“quick
i
say
you
bildad
and
get
the
ship’s
papers
we
must
have
hedgehog
there
i
mean
quohog
in
one
of
our
boats
look
ye
quohog
we’ll
give
ye
the
ninetieth
lay
and
that’s
more
than
ever
was
given
a
harpooneer
yet
out
of
nantucket.”
so
down
we
went
into
the
cabin
and
to
my
great
joy
queequeg
was
soon
enrolled
among
the
same
ship’s
company
to
which
i
myself
belonged
when
all
preliminaries
were
over
and
peleg
had
got
everything
ready
for
signing
he
turned
to
me
and
said
“i
guess
quohog
there
don’t
know
how
to
write
does
he
i
say
quohog
blast
ye
dost
thou
sign
thy
name
or
make
thy
mark?”
but
at
this
question
queequeg
who
had
twice
or
thrice
before
taken
part
in
similar
ceremonies
looked
no
ways
abashed
but
taking
the
offered
pen
copied
upon
the
paper
in
the
proper
place
an
exact
counterpart
of
a
queer
round
figure
which
was
tattooed
upon
his
arm
so
that
through
captain
peleg’s
obstinate
mistake
touching
his
appellative
it
stood
something
like
this:—
quohog
his
x
mark
meanwhile
captain
bildad
sat
earnestly
and
steadfastly
eyeing
queequeg
and
at
last
rising
solemnly
and
fumbling
in
the
huge
pockets
of
his
broad-skirted
drab
coat
took
out
a
bundle
of
tracts
and
selecting
one
entitled
“the
latter
day
coming
or
no
time
to
lose,”
placed
it
in
queequeg’s
hands
and
then
grasping
them
and
the
book
with
both
his
looked
earnestly
into
his
eyes
and
said
“son
of
darkness
i
must
do
my
duty
by
thee
i
am
part
owner
of
this
ship
and
feel
concerned
for

pit!”
something
of
the
salt
sea
yet
lingered
in
old
bildad’s
language
heterogeneously
mixed
with
scriptural
and
domestic
phrases
“avast
there
avast
there
bildad
avast
now
spoiling
our
harpooneer,”
cried
peleg
“pious
harpooneers
never
make
good

out
of
’em
no

joined

never
came

he
got
so
frightened
about
his
plaguy
soul
that
he
shrinked
and
sheered
away
from
whales
for
fear
of
after-claps
in

he
got
stove
and
went
to

“peleg
peleg!”
said
bildad
lifting
his
eyes
and
hands
“thou
thyself
as
i
myself
hast
seen
many
a
perilous
time
thou
knowest
peleg
what
it
is
to

overboard

that

voyage
when
thou
went
mate
with
captain
ahab
did’st
thou
not
think
of
death
and
the
judgment
then?”
“hear
him
hear
him
now,”
cried
peleg
marching
across
the
cabin
and
thrusting
his
hands
far
down
into
his
pockets,—“hear
him
all
of
ye
think
of
that
when
every
moment
we
thought
the
ship
would
sink
death
and
the
judgment
then
what
with
all
three
masts
making
such
an
everlasting
thundering
against
the
side
and
every
sea
breaking
over
us

and
aft

no
no

think
about
death

all
hands—how
to
rig
jury-masts—how
to
get
into
the
nearest
port
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
of.”
bildad
said
no
more
but
buttoning
up
his
coat
stalked
on
deck
where
we
followed
him
there
he
stood
very
quietly
overlooking
some
sailmakers
who
were
mending
a
top-sail
in
the
waist
now
and
then
he
stooped
to
pick
up
a
patch
or
save
an
end
of
tarred
twine
which
otherwise
might
have
been
wasted

queequeg
and
i
had
just
left
the
pequod
and
were
sauntering
away
from
the
water
for
the
moment
each
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
when
the
above
words
were
put
to
us
by
a
stranger
who
pausing
before
us
levelled
his
massive
forefinger
at
the
vessel
in
question
he
was
but
shabbily
apparelled
in
faded
jacket
and
patched
trowsers
a
rag
of
a
black
handkerchief
investing
his
neck
a
confluent
small-pox
had
in
all
directions
flowed
over
his
face
and
left
it
like
the
complicated
ribbed
bed
of
a
torrent
when
the
rushing
waters
have
been
dried
up
“have
ye
shipped
in
her?”
he
repeated
“you
mean
the
ship
pequod
i
suppose,”
said
i
trying
to
gain
a
little
more
time
for
an
uninterrupted
look
at
him
“aye
the
pequod—that
ship
there,”
he
said
drawing
back
his
whole
arm
and
then
rapidly
shoving
it
straight
out
from
him
with
the
fixed
bayonet
of
his
pointed
finger
darted
full
at
the
object
“yes,”
said
i
“we
have
just
signed
the
articles.”
“anything
down
there
about
your
souls?”
“about
what?”
“oh
perhaps
you
hav’n’t
got
any,”
he
said
quickly
“no
matter
though
i
know
many
chaps
that
hav’n’t
got
any,—good
luck
to
’em
and
they
are
all
the
better
off
for
it
a
soul’s
a
sort
of
a
fifth
wheel
to
a
wagon.”
“what
are
you
jabbering
about
shipmate?”
said
i
“_he’s_
got
enough
though
to
make
up
for
all
deficiencies
of
that
sort
in
other
chaps,”
abruptly
said
the
stranger
placing
a
nervous
emphasis
upon
the
word
_he_
“queequeg,”
said
i
“let’s
go
this
fellow
has
broken
loose
from
somewhere
he’s
talking
about
something
and
somebody
we
don’t
know.”
“stop!”
cried
the
stranger
“ye
said
true—ye
hav’n’t
seen
old
thunder
yet
have
ye?”
“who’s
old
thunder?”
said
i
again
riveted
with
the
insane
earnestness
of
his
manner
“captain
ahab.”
“what
the
captain
of
our
ship
the
pequod?”
“aye
among
some
of
us
old
sailor
chaps
he
goes
by
that
name
ye
hav’n’t
seen
him
yet
have
ye?”
“no
we
hav’n’t
he’s
sick
they
say
but
is
getting
better
and
will
be
all
right
again
before
long.”
“all
right
again
before
long!”
laughed
the
stranger
with
a
solemnly
derisive
sort
of
laugh
“look
ye
when
captain
ahab
is
all
right
then
this
left
arm
of
mine
will
be
all
right
not
before.”
“what
do
you
know
about
him?”
“what
did
they
_tell_
you
about
him
say
that!”
“they
didn’t
tell
much
of
anything
about
him
only
i’ve
heard
that
he’s
a
good
whale-hunter
and
a
good
captain
to
his
crew.”
“that’s
true
that’s
true—yes
both
true
enough
but
you
must
jump
when
he
gives
an
order
step
and
growl
growl
and
go—that’s
the
word
with
captain
ahab
but
nothing
about
that
thing
that
happened
to
him
off
cape
horn
long
ago
when
he
lay
like
dead
for
three
days
and
nights
nothing
about
that
deadly
skrimmage
with
the
spaniard
afore
the
altar
in
santa?—heard
nothing
about
that
eh
nothing
about
the
silver
calabash
he
spat
into
and
nothing
about
his
losing
his
leg
last
voyage
according
to
the
prophecy
didn’t
ye
hear
a
word
about
them
matters
and
something
more
eh
no
i
don’t
think
ye
did
how
could
ye
who
knows
it
not
all
nantucket
i
guess
but
hows’ever
mayhap
ye’ve
heard
tell
about
the
leg
and
how
he
lost
it
aye
ye
have
heard
of
that
i
dare
say
oh
yes
_that_
every
one
knows
a’most—i
mean
they
know
he’s
only
one
leg
and
that
a
parmacetti
took
the
other
off.”
“my
friend,”
said
i
“what
all
this
gibberish
of
yours
is
about
i
don’t
know
and
i
don’t
much
care
for
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
be
a
little
damaged
in
the
head
but
if
you
are
speaking
of
captain
ahab
of
that
ship
there
the
pequod
then
let
me
tell
you
that
i
know
all
about
the
loss
of
his
leg.”
“_all_
about
it
eh—sure
you
do?—all?”
“pretty
sure.”
with
finger
pointed
and
eye
levelled
at
the
pequod
the
beggar-like
stranger
stood
a
moment
as
if
in
a
troubled
reverie
then
starting
a
little
turned
and
said:—“ye’ve
shipped
have
ye
names
down
on
the
papers
well
well
what’s
signed
is
signed
and
what’s
to
be
will
be
and
then
again
perhaps
it
won’t
be
after
all
anyhow
it’s
all
fixed
and
arranged
a’ready
and
some
sailors
or
other
must
go
with
him
i
suppose
as
well
these
as
any
other
men
god
pity
’em
morning
to
ye
shipmates
morning
the
ineffable
heavens
bless
ye
i’m
sorry
i
stopped
ye.”
“look
here
friend,”
said
i
“if
you
have
anything
important
to
tell
us
out
with
it
but
if
you
are
only
trying
to
bamboozle
us
you
are
mistaken
in
your
game
that’s
all
i
have
to
say.”
“and
it’s
said
very
well
and
i
like
to
hear
a
chap
talk
up
that
way
you
are
just
the
man
for
him—the
likes
of
ye
morning
to
ye
shipmates
morning
oh
when
ye
get
there
tell
’em
i’ve
concluded
not
to
make
one
of
’em.”
“ah
my
dear
fellow
you
can’t
fool
us
that
way—you
can’t
fool
us
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
to
look
as
if
he
had
a
great
secret
in
him.”
“morning
to
ye
shipmates
morning.”
“morning
it
is,”
said
i
“come
along
queequeg
let’s
leave
this
crazy
man
but
stop
tell
me
your
name
will
you?”
“elijah.”
elijah
thought
i
and
we
walked
away
both
commenting
after
each
other’s
fashion
upon
this
ragged
old
sailor
and
agreed
that
he
was
nothing
but
a
humbug
trying
to
be
a
bugbear
but
we
had
not
gone
perhaps
above
a
hundred
yards
when
chancing
to
turn
a
corner
and
looking
back
as
i
did
so
who
should
be
seen
but
elijah
following
us
though
at
a
distance
somehow
the
sight
of
him
struck
me
so
that
i
said
nothing
to
queequeg
of
his
being
behind
but
passed
on
with
my
comrade
anxious
to
see
whether
the
stranger
would
turn
the
same
corner
that
we
did
he
did
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
dogging
us
but
with
what
intent
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
this
circumstance
coupled
with
his
ambiguous
half-hinting
half-revealing
shrouded
sort
of
talk
now
begat
in
me
all
kinds
of
vague
wonderments
and
half-apprehensions
and
all
connected
with
the
pequod
and
captain
ahab
and
the
leg
he
had
lost
and
the
cape
horn
fit
and
the
silver
calabash
and
what
captain
peleg
had
said
of
him
when
i
left
the
ship
the
day
previous
and
the
prediction
of
the
squaw
tistig
and
the
voyage
we
had
bound
ourselves
to
sail
and
a
hundred
other
shadowy
things
i
was
resolved
to
satisfy
myself
whether
this
ragged
elijah
was
really
dogging
us
or
not
and
with
that
intent
crossed
the
way
with
queequeg
and
on
that
side
of
it
retraced
our
steps
but
elijah
passed
on
without
seeming
to
notice
us
this
relieved
me
and
once
more
and
finally
as
it
seemed
to
me
i
pronounced
him
in
my
heart
a
humbug
chapter
20
all
astir
a
day
or
two
passed
and
there
was
great
activity
aboard
the
pequod
not
only
were
the
old
sails
being
mended
but
new
sails
were
coming
on
board
and
bolts
of
canvas
and
coils
of
rigging
in
short
everything
betokened
that
the
ship’s
preparations
were
hurrying
to
a
close
captain
peleg
seldom
or
never
went
ashore
but
sat
in
his
wigwam
keeping
a
sharp
look-out
upon
the
hands
bildad
did
all
the
purchasing
and
providing
at
the
stores
and
the
men
employed
in
the
hold
and
on
the
rigging
were
working
till
long
after
night-fall
on
the
day
following
queequeg’s
signing
the
articles
word
was
given
at
all
the
inns
where
the
ship’s
company
were
stopping
that
their
chests
must
be
on
board
before
night
for
there
was
no
telling
how
soon
the
vessel
might
be
sailing
so
queequeg
and
i
got
down
our
traps
resolving
however
to
sleep
ashore
till
the
last
but
it
seems
they
always
give
very
long
notice
in
these
cases
and
the
ship
did
not
sail
for
several
days
but
no
wonder
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
done
and
there
is
no
telling
how
many
things
to
be
thought
of
before
the
pequod
was
fully
equipped
every
one
knows
what
a
multitude
of
things—beds
sauce-pans
knives
and
forks
shovels
and
tongs
napkins
nut-crackers
and
what
not
are
indispensable
to
the
business
of
housekeeping
just
so
with
whaling
which
necessitates
a
three-years’
housekeeping
upon
the
wide
ocean
far
from
all
grocers
costermongers
doctors
bakers
and
bankers
and
though
this
also
holds
true
of
merchant
vessels
yet
not
by
any
means
to
the
same
extent
as
with
whalemen
for
besides
the
great
length
of
the
whaling
voyage
the
numerous
articles
peculiar
to
the
prosecution
of
the
fishery
and
the
impossibility
of
replacing
them
at
the
remote
harbors
usually
frequented
it
must
be
remembered
that
of
all
ships
whaling
vessels
are
the
most
exposed
to
accidents
of
all
kinds
and
especially
to
the
destruction
and
loss
of
the
very
things
upon
which
the
success
of
the
voyage
most
depends
hence
the
spare
boats
spare
spars
and
spare
lines
and
harpoons
and
spare
everythings
almost
but
a
spare
captain
and
duplicate
ship
at
the
period
of
our
arrival
at
the
island
the
heaviest
storage
of
the
pequod
had
been
almost
completed
comprising
her
beef
bread
water
fuel
and
iron
hoops
and
staves
but
as
before
hinted
for
some
time
there
was
a
continual
fetching
and
carrying
on
board
of
divers
odds
and
ends
of
things
both
large
and
small
chief
among
those
who
did
this
fetching
and
carrying
was
captain
bildad’s
sister
a
lean
old
lady
of
a
most
determined
and
indefatigable
spirit
but
withal
very
kindhearted
who
seemed
resolved
that
if
_she_
could
help
it
nothing
should
be
found
wanting
in
the
pequod
after
once
fairly
getting
to
sea
at
one
time
she
would
come
on
board
with
a
jar
of
pickles
for
the
steward’s
pantry
another
time
with
a
bunch
of
quills
for
the
chief
mate’s
desk
where
he
kept
his
log
a
third
time
with
a
roll
of
flannel
for
the
small
of
some
one’s
rheumatic
back
never
did
any
woman
better
deserve
her
name
which
was
charity—aunt
charity
as
everybody
called
her
and
like
a
sister
of
charity
did
this
charitable
aunt
charity
bustle
about
hither
and
thither
ready
to
turn
her
hand
and
heart
to
anything
that
promised
to
yield
safety
comfort
and
consolation
to
all
on
board
a
ship
in
which
her
beloved
brother
bildad
was
concerned
and
in
which
she
herself
owned
a
score
or
two
of
well-saved
dollars
but
it
was
startling
to
see
this
excellent
hearted
quakeress
coming
on
board
as
she
did
the
last
day
with
a
long
oil-ladle
in
one
hand
and
a
still
longer
whaling
lance
in
the
other
nor
was
bildad
himself
nor
captain
peleg
at
all
backward
as
for
bildad
he
carried
about
with
him
a
long
list
of
the
articles
needed
and
at
every
fresh
arrival
down
went
his
mark
opposite
that
article
upon
the
paper
every
once
in
a
while
peleg
came
hobbling
out
of
his
whalebone
den
roaring
at
the
men
down
the
hatchways
roaring
up
to
the
riggers
at
the
mast-head
and
then
concluded
by
roaring
back
into
his
wigwam
during
these
days
of
preparation
queequeg
and
i
often
visited
the
craft
and
as
often
i
asked
about
captain
ahab
and
how
he
was
and
when
he
was
going
to
come
on
board
his
ship
to
these
questions
they
would
answer
that
he
was
getting
better
and
better
and
was
expected
aboard
every
day
meantime
the
two
captains
peleg
and
bildad
could
attend
to
everything
necessary
to
fit
the
vessel
for
the
voyage
if
i
had
been
downright
honest
with
myself
i
would
have
seen
very
plainly
in
my
heart
that
i
did
but
half
fancy
being
committed
this
way
to
so
long
a
voyage
without
once
laying
my
eyes
on
the
man
who
was
to
be
the
absolute
dictator
of
it
so
soon
as
the
ship
sailed
out
upon
the
open
sea
but
when
a
man
suspects
any
wrong
it
sometimes
happens
that
if
he
be
already
involved
in
the
matter
he
insensibly
strives
to
cover
up
his
suspicions
even
from
himself
and
much
this
way
it
was
with
me
i
said
nothing
and
tried
to
think
nothing
at
last
it
was
given
out
that
some
time
next
day
the
ship
would
certainly
sail
so
next
morning
queequeg
and
i
took
a
very
early
start
chapter
21
going
aboard
it
was
nearly
six
o’clock
but
only
grey
imperfect
misty
dawn
when
we
drew
nigh
the
wharf
“there
are
some
sailors
running
ahead
there
if
i
see
right,”
said
i
to
queequeg
“it
can’t
be
shadows
she’s
off
by
sunrise
i
guess
come
on!”
“avast!”
cried
a
voice
whose
owner
at
the
same
time
coming
close
behind
us
laid
a
hand
upon
both
our
shoulders
and
then
insinuating
himself
between
us
stood
stooping
forward
a
little
in
the
uncertain
twilight
strangely
peering
from
queequeg
to
me
it
was
elijah
“going
aboard?”
“hands
off
will
you,”
said
i
“lookee
here,”
said
queequeg
shaking
himself
“go
’way!”
“ain’t
going
aboard
then?”
“yes
we
are,”
said
i
“but
what
business
is
that
of
yours
do
you
know
mr
elijah
that
i
consider
you
a
little
impertinent?”
“no
no
no
i
wasn’t
aware
of
that,”
said
elijah
slowly
and
wonderingly
looking
from
me
to
queequeg
with
the
most
unaccountable
glances
“elijah,”
said
i
“you
will
oblige
my
friend
and
me
by
withdrawing
we
are
going
to
the
indian
and
pacific
oceans
and
would
prefer
not
to
be
detained.”
“ye
be
be
ye
coming
back
afore
breakfast?”
“he’s
cracked
queequeg,”
said
i
“come
on.”
“holloa!”
cried
stationary
elijah
hailing
us
when
we
had
removed
a
few
paces
“never
mind
him,”
said
i
“queequeg
come
on.”
but
he
stole
up
to
us
again
and
suddenly
clapping
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
said—“did
ye
see
anything
looking
like
men
going
towards
that
ship
a
while
ago?”
struck
by
this
plain
matter-of-fact
question
i
answered
saying
“yes
i
thought
i
did
see
four
or
five
men
but
it
was
too
dim
to
be
sure.”
“very
dim
very
dim,”
said
elijah
“morning
to
ye.”
once
more
we
quitted
him
but
once
more
he
came
softly
after
us
and
touching
my
shoulder
again
said
“see
if
you
can
find
’em
now
will
ye
“find
who?”
“morning
to
ye
morning
to
ye!”
he
rejoined
again
moving
off
“oh
i
was
going
to
warn
ye
against—but
never
mind
never
mind—it’s
all
one
all
in
the
family
too;—sharp
frost
this
morning
ain’t
it
good-bye
to
ye
shan’t
see
ye
again
very
soon
i
guess
unless
it’s
before
the
grand
jury.”
and
with
these
cracked
words
he
finally
departed
leaving
me
for
the
moment
in
no
small
wonderment
at
his
frantic
impudence
at
last
stepping
on
board
the
pequod
we
found
everything
in
profound
quiet
not
a
soul
moving
the
cabin
entrance
was
locked
within
the
hatches
were
all
on
and
lumbered
with
coils
of
rigging
going
forward
to
the
forecastle
we
found
the
slide
of
the
scuttle
open
seeing
a
light
we
went
down
and
found
only
an
old
rigger
there
wrapped
in
a
tattered
pea-jacket
he
was
thrown
at
whole
length
upon
two
chests
his
face
downwards
and
inclosed
in
his
folded
arms
the
profoundest
slumber
slept
upon
him
“those
sailors
we
saw
queequeg
where
can
they
have
gone
to?”
said
i
looking
dubiously
at
the
sleeper
but
it
seemed
that
when
on
the
wharf
queequeg
had
not
at
all
noticed
what
i
now
alluded
to
hence
i
would
have
thought
myself
to
have
been
optically
deceived
in
that
matter
were
it
not
for
elijah’s
otherwise
inexplicable
question
but
i
beat
the
thing
down
and
again
marking
the
sleeper
jocularly
hinted
to
queequeg
that
perhaps
we
had
best
sit
up
with
the
body
telling
him
to
establish
himself
accordingly
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
sleeper’s
rear
as
though
feeling
if
it
was
soft
enough
and
then
without
more
ado
sat
quietly
down
there
“gracious
queequeg
don’t
sit
there,”
said
i
“oh
perry
dood
seat,”
said
queequeg
“my
country
way
won’t
hurt
him
face.”
“face!”
said
i
“call
that
his
face
very
benevolent
countenance
then
but
how
hard
he
breathes
he’s
heaving
himself
get
off
queequeg
you
are
heavy
it’s
grinding
the
face
of
the
poor
get
off
queequeg
look
he’ll
twitch
you
off
soon
i
wonder
he
don’t
wake.”
queequeg
removed
himself
to
just
beyond
the
head
of
the
sleeper
and
lighted
his
tomahawk
pipe
i
sat
at
the
feet
we
kept
the
pipe
passing
over
the
sleeper
from
one
to
the
other
meanwhile
upon
questioning
him
in
his
broken
fashion
queequeg
gave
me
to
understand
that
in
his
land
owing
to
the
absence
of
settees
and
sofas
of
all
sorts
the
king
chiefs
and
great
people
generally
were
in
the
custom
of
fattening
some
of
the
lower
orders
for
ottomans
and
to
furnish
a
house
comfortably
in
that
respect
you
had
only
to
buy
up
eight
or
ten
lazy
fellows
and
lay
them
round
in
the
piers
and
alcoves

it
was
very
convenient
on
an
excursion

better
than
those

walking-sticks
upon

a
chief
calling
his
attendant
and
desiring
him
to
make
a
settee
of
himself

a
spreading
tree
perhaps
in
some
damp
marshy
place
while
narrating
these
things
every

the
tomahawk
from

he
flourished
the
hatchet-side
of
it
over
the
sleeper’s
head
“what’s
that
for
queequeg?”
“perry
easy
kill-e
oh
perry
easy!”
he
was
going
on
with
some
wild
reminiscences
about
his
tomahawk-pipe
which
it
seemed
had
in
its
two
uses
both
brained
his
foes
and
soothed
his
soul
when
we
were
directly
attracted
to
the
sleeping
rigger
the
strong
vapor
now
completely
filling
the
contracted
hole
it
began
to
tell
upon
him
he
breathed
with
a
sort
of
muffledness
then
seemed
troubled
in
the
nose
then
revolved
over
once
or
twice
then
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
“holloa!”
he
breathed
at
last
“who
be
ye
smokers?”
“shipped
men,”
answered
i
“when
does
she
sail?”
“aye
aye
ye
are
going
in
her
be
ye
she
sails
to-day
the
captain
came
aboard
last
night.”
“what
captain?—ahab?”
“who
but
him
indeed?”
i
was
going
to
ask
him
some
further
questions
concerning
ahab
when
we
heard
a
noise
on
deck
“holloa
starbuck’s
astir,”
said
the
rigger
“he’s
a
lively
chief
mate
that
good
man
and
a
pious
but
all
alive
now
i
must
turn
to.”
and
so
saying
he
went
on
deck
and
we
followed
it
was
now
clear
sunrise
soon
the
crew
came
on
board
in
twos
and
threes
the
riggers
bestirred
themselves
the
mates
were
actively
engaged
and
several
of
the
shore
people
were
busy
in
bringing
various
last
things
on
board
meanwhile
captain
ahab
remained
invisibly
enshrined
within
his
cabin
chapter
22
merry
christmas
at
length
towards
noon
upon
the
final
dismissal
of
the
ship’s
riggers
and
after
the
pequod
had
been
hauled
out
from
the
wharf
and
after
the
ever-thoughtful
charity
had
come
off
in
a
whale-boat
with
her
last
gift—a
night-cap
for
stubb
the
second
mate
her
brother-in-law
and
a
spare
bible
for
the
steward—after
all
this
the
two
captains
peleg
and
bildad
issued
from
the
cabin
and
turning
to
the
chief
mate
peleg
said
“now
mr
starbuck
are
you
sure
everything
is
right
captain
ahab
is
all
ready—just
spoke
to
him—nothing
more
to
be
got
from
shore
eh
well
call
all
hands
then
muster
’em
aft
here—blast
’em!”
“no
need
of
profane
words
however
great
the
hurry
peleg,”
said
bildad
“but
away
with
thee
friend
starbuck
and
do
our
bidding.”
how
now
here
upon
the
very
point
of
starting
for
the
voyage
captain
peleg
and
captain
bildad
were
going
it
with
a
high
hand
on
the
quarter-deck
just
as
if
they
were
to
be
joint-commanders
at
sea
as
well
as
to
all
appearances
in
port
and
as
for
captain
ahab
no
sign
of
him
was
yet
to
be
seen
only
they
said
he
was
in
the
cabin
but
then
the
idea
was
that
his
presence
was
by
no
means
necessary
in
getting
the
ship
under
weigh
and
steering
her
well
out
to
sea
indeed
as
that
was
not
at
all
his
proper
business
but
the
pilot’s
and
as
he
was
not
yet
completely
recovered—so
they
said—therefore
captain
ahab
stayed
below
and
all
this
seemed
natural
enough
especially
as
in
the
merchant
service
many
captains
never
show
themselves
on
deck
for
a
considerable
time
after
heaving
up
the
anchor
but
remain
over
the
cabin
table
having
a
farewell
merry-making
with
their
shore
friends
before
they
quit
the
ship
for
good
with
the
pilot
but
there
was
not
much
chance
to
think
over
the
matter
for
captain
peleg
was
now
all
alive
he
seemed
to
do
most
of
the
talking
and
commanding
and
not
bildad
“aft
here
ye
sons
of
bachelors,”
he
cried
as
the
sailors
lingered
at
the
main-mast
“mr
starbuck
drive
’em
aft.”
“strike
the
tent
there!”—was
the
next
order
as
i
hinted
before
this
whalebone
marquee
was
never
pitched
except
in
port
and
on
board
the
pequod
for
thirty
years
the
order
to
strike
the
tent
was
well
known
to
be
the
next
thing
to
heaving
up
the
anchor
“man
the
capstan
blood
and
thunder!—jump!”—was
the
next
command
and
the
crew
sprang
for
the
handspikes
now
in
getting
under
weigh
the
station
generally
occupied
by
the
pilot
is
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
and
here
bildad
who
with
peleg
be
it
known
in
addition
to
his
other
officers
was
one
of
the
licensed
pilots
of
the
port—he
being
suspected
to
have
got
himself
made
a
pilot
in
order
to
save
the
nantucket
pilot-fee
to
all
the
ships
he
was
concerned
in
for
he
never
piloted
any
other
craft—bildad
i
say
might
now
be
seen
actively
engaged
in
looking
over
the
bows
for
the
approaching
anchor
and
at
intervals
singing
what
seemed
a
dismal
stave
of
psalmody
to
cheer
the
hands
at
the
windlass
who
roared
forth
some
sort
of
a
chorus
about
the
girls
in
booble
alley
with
hearty
good
will
nevertheless
not
three
days
previous
bildad
had
told
them
that
no
profane
songs
would
be
allowed
on
board
the
pequod
particularly
in
getting
under
weigh
and
charity
his
sister
had
placed
a
small
choice
copy
of
watts
in
each
seaman’s
berth
meantime
overseeing
the
other
part
of
the
ship
captain
peleg
ripped
and
swore
astern
in
the
most
frightful
manner
i
almost
thought
he
would
sink
the
ship
before
the
anchor
could
be
got
up
involuntarily
i
paused
on
my
handspike
and
told
queequeg
to
do
the
same
thinking
of
the
perils
we
both
ran
in
starting
on
the
voyage
with
such
a
devil
for
a
pilot
i
was
comforting
myself
however
with
the
thought
that
in
pious
bildad
might
be
found
some
salvation
spite
of
his
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
lay
when
i
felt
a
sudden
sharp
poke
in
my
rear
and
turning
round
was
horrified
at
the
apparition
of
captain
peleg
in
the
act
of
withdrawing
his
leg
from
my
immediate
vicinity
that
was
my
first
kick
“is
that
the
way
they
heave
in
the
marchant
service?”
he
roared
“spring
thou
sheep-head
spring
and
break
thy
backbone
why
don’t
ye
spring
i
say
all
of
ye—spring
quohog
spring
thou
chap
with
the
red
whiskers
spring
there
scotch-cap
spring
thou
green
pants
spring
i
say
all
of
ye
and
spring
your
eyes
out!”
and
so
saying
he
moved
along
the
windlass
here
and
there
using
his
leg
very
freely
while
imperturbable
bildad
kept
leading
off
with
his
psalmody
thinks
i
captain
peleg
must
have
been
drinking
something
to-day
at
last
the
anchor
was
up
the
sails
were
set
and
off
we
glided
it
was
a
short
cold
christmas
and
as
the
short
northern
day
merged
into
night
we
found
ourselves
almost
broad
upon
the
wintry
ocean
whose
freezing
spray
cased
us
in
ice
as
in
polished
armor
the
long
rows
of
teeth
on
the
bulwarks
glistened
in
the
moonlight
and
like
the
white
ivory
tusks
of
some
huge
elephant
vast
curving
icicles
depended
from
the
bows
lank
bildad
as
pilot
headed
the
first
watch
and
ever
and
anon
as
the
old
craft
deep
dived
into
the
green
seas
and
sent
the
shivering
frost
all
over
her
and
the
winds
howled
and
the
cordage
rang
his
steady
notes
were
heard,—
_“sweet
fields
beyond
the
swelling
flood
stand
dressed
in
living
green
so
to
the
jews
old
canaan
stood
while
jordan
rolled
between.”_
never
did
those
sweet
words
sound
more
sweetly
to
me
than
then
they
were
full
of
hope
and
fruition
spite
of
this
frigid
winter
night
in
the
boisterous
atlantic
spite
of
my
wet
feet
and
wetter
jacket
there
was
yet
it
then
seemed
to
me
many
a
pleasant
haven
in
store
and
meads
and
glades
so
eternally
vernal
that
the
grass
shot
up
by
the
spring
untrodden
unwilted
remains
at
midsummer
at
last
we
gained
such
an
offing
that
the
two
pilots
were
needed
no
longer
the
stout
sail-boat
that
had
accompanied
us
began
ranging
alongside
it
was
curious
and
not
unpleasing
how
peleg
and
bildad
were
affected
at
this
juncture
especially
captain
bildad
for
loath
to
depart
yet
very
loath
to
leave
for
good
a
ship
bound
on
so
long
and
perilous
a
voyage—beyond
both
stormy
capes
a
ship
in
which
some
thousands
of
his
hard
earned
dollars
were
invested
a
ship
in
which
an
old
shipmate
sailed
as
captain
a
man
almost
as
old
as
he
once
more
starting
to
encounter
all
the
terrors
of
the
pitiless
jaw
loath
to
say
good-bye
to
a
thing
so
every
way
brimful
of
every
interest
to
him,—poor
old
bildad
lingered
long
paced
the
deck
with
anxious
strides
ran
down
into
the
cabin
to
speak
another
farewell
word
there
again
came
on
deck
and
looked
to
windward
looked
towards
the
wide
and
endless
waters
only
bounded
by
the
far-off
unseen
eastern
continents
looked
towards
the
land
looked
aloft
looked
right
and
left
looked
everywhere
and
nowhere
and
at
last
mechanically
coiling
a
rope
upon
its
pin
convulsively
grasped
stout
peleg
by
the
hand
and
holding
up
a
lantern
for
a
moment
stood
gazing
heroically
in
his
face
as
much
as
to
say
“nevertheless
friend
peleg
i
can
stand
it
yes
i
can.”
as
for
peleg
himself
he
took
it
more
like
a
philosopher
but
for
all
his
philosophy
there
was
a
tear
twinkling
in
his
eye
when
the
lantern
came
too
near
and
he
too
did
not
a
little
run
from
cabin
to
deck—now
a
word
below
and
now
a
word
with
starbuck
the
chief
mate
but
at
last
he
turned
to
his
comrade
with
a
final
sort
of
look
about
him,—“captain
bildad—come

must
go

“god

murmured
old
bildad
almost
incoherently
“i

“come

with
that

him
over

the
advocate
as
queequeg
and
i
are
now
fairly
embarked
in
this
business
of
whaling
and
as
this
business
of
whaling
has
somehow
come
to
be
regarded
among
landsmen
as
a
rather
unpoetical
and
disreputable
pursuit
therefore
i
am
all
anxiety
to
convince
ye
ye
landsmen
of
the
injustice
hereby
done
to
us
hunters
of
whales
in
the
first
place
it
may
be
deemed
almost
superfluous
to
establish
the
fact
that
among
people
at
large
the
business
of
whaling
is
not
accounted
on
a
level
with
what
are
called
the
liberal
professions
if
a
stranger
were
introduced
into
any
miscellaneous
metropolitan
society
it
would
but
slightly
advance
the
general
opinion
of
his
merits
were
he
presented
to
the
company

if
in
emulation
of

naval
officers
he
should
append
the
initials

to
his

such
a
procedure
would
be
deemed
pre-eminently
presuming
and
ridiculous
doubtless
one
leading
reason
why
the
world
declines
honoring
us
whalemen
is
this
they
think
that
at
best
our
vocation
amounts
to
a
butchering
sort
of
business
and
that
when
actively
engaged
therein
we
are
surrounded
by

of
defilements

are

of

delights

certain

what
disordered
slippery
decks
of
a
whale-ship
are
comparable
to
the
unspeakable
carrion
of
those
battle-fields
from
which
so
many
soldiers
return
to
drink
in
all
ladies’
plaudits
and
if
the
idea
of
peril
so
much
enhances
the
popular
conceit
of
the
soldier’s
profession
let
me
assure
ye
that
many
a
veteran
who
has
freely
marched
up
to
a
battery
would
quickly
recoil
at
the
apparition
of
the
sperm
whale’s
vast
tail
fanning
into
eddies
the
air
over
his
head
for
what
are
the
comprehensible
terrors
of
man
compared
with
the
interlinked
terrors
and
wonders
of
god
but
though
the
world
scouts
at
us
whale
hunters
yet
does
it
unwittingly
pay
us
the
profoundest
homage
yea
an
all-abounding
adoration
for
almost
all
the
tapers
lamps
and
candles
that
burn
round
the
globe
burn
as
before
so
many
shrines
to
our
glory
but
look
at
this
matter
in
other
lights
weigh
it
in
all
sorts
of
scales
see
what
we
whalemen
are
and
have
been
why
did
the
dutch
in
de
witt’s
time
have
admirals
of
their
whaling
fleets
why
did
louis
xvi
of
france
at
his
own
personal
expense
fit
out
whaling
ships
from
dunkirk
and
politely
invite
to
that
town
some
score
or
two
of
families
from
our
own
island
of
nantucket
why
did
britain
between
the
years
1750
and
1788
pay
to
her
whalemen
in
bounties
upwards
of
£1,000,000
and
lastly
how
comes
it
that
we
whalemen
of
america
now
outnumber
all
the
rest
of
the
banded
whalemen
in
the
world
sail
a
navy
of
upwards
of
seven
hundred
vessels
manned
by
eighteen
thousand
men
yearly
consuming
4,000,000
of
dollars
the
ships
worth
at
the
time
of
sailing
$20,000,000
and
every
year
importing
into
our
harbors
a
well
reaped
harvest
of
$7,000,000
how
comes
all
this
if
there
be
not
something
puissant
in
whaling
but
this
is
not
the
half
look
again
i
freely
assert
that
the
cosmopolite
philosopher
cannot
for
his
life
point
out
one
single
peaceful
influence
which
within
the
last
sixty
years
has
operated
more
potentially
upon
the
whole
broad
world
taken
in
one
aggregate
than
the
high
and
mighty
business
of
whaling
one
way
and
another
it
has
begotten
events
so
remarkable
in
themselves
and
so
continuously
momentous
in
their
sequential
issues
that
whaling
may
well
be
regarded
as
that
egyptian
mother
who
bore
offspring
themselves
pregnant
from
her
womb
it
would
be
a
hopeless
endless
task
to
catalogue
all
these
things
let
a
handful
suffice
for
many
years
past
the
whale-ship
has
been
the
pioneer
in
ferreting
out
the
remotest
and
least
known
parts
of
the
earth
she
has
explored
seas
and
archipelagoes
which
had
no
chart
where
no
cook
or
vancouver
had
ever
sailed
if
american
and
european
men-of-war
now
peacefully
ride
in
once
savage
harbors
let
them
fire
salutes
to
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
whale-ship
which
originally
showed
them
the
way
and
first
interpreted
between
them
and
the
savages
they
may
celebrate
as
they
will
the
heroes
of
exploring
expeditions
your
cooks
your
krusensterns
but
i
say
that
scores
of
anonymous
captains
have
sailed
out
of
nantucket
that
were
as
great
and
greater
than
your
cook
and
your
krusenstern
for
in
their
succourless
empty-handedness
they
in
the
heathenish
sharked
waters
and
by
the
beaches
of
unrecorded
javelin
islands
battled
with
virgin
wonders
and
terrors
that
cook
with
all
his
marines
and
muskets
would
not
willingly
have
dared
all
that
is
made
such
a
flourish
of
in

those

were

life-time
commonplaces
of

an

it
is

that
at

a

curious

might
be
ruminated
here
concerning
the
essential
dignity
of
this
regal
process
because
in
common

we
esteem

meanly

contemptibly
a

who
anoints
his

palpably
smells
of

a
general
rule
he
can’t
amount
to
much
in

totality

the
only
thing
to
be
considered
here
is
this—what
kind
of
oil
is
used
at

certainly
it
cannot
be
olive
oil
nor
macassar
oil
nor

oil
nor

what
then

knights

the
chief
mate
of
the
pequod
was
starbuck
a
native
of
nantucket
and
a
quaker
by
descent
he
was
a
long
earnest
man
and
though
born
on
an
icy
coast
seemed
well
adapted
to
endure
hot
latitudes
his
flesh
being
hard
as
twice-baked
biscuit
transported
to
the
indies
his
live
blood
would
not
spoil
like
bottled
ale
he
must
have
been
born
in
some
time
of
general
drought
and
famine
or
upon
one
of
those
fast
days
for
which
his
state
is
famous
only
some
thirty
arid
summers
had
he
seen
those
summers
had
dried
up
all
his
physical
superfluousness
but
this
his
thinness
so
to
speak
seemed
no
more
the
token
of
wasting
anxieties
and
cares
than
it
seemed
the
indication
of
any
bodily
blight
it
was
merely
the
condensation
of
the
man
he
was
by
no
means
ill-looking
quite
the
contrary
his
pure
tight
skin
was
an
excellent
fit
and
closely
wrapped
up
in
it
and
embalmed
with
inner
health
and
strength
like
a
revivified
egyptian
this
starbuck
seemed
prepared
to
endure
for
long
ages
to
come
and
to
endure
always
as
now
for
be
it
polar
snow
or
torrid
sun
like
a
patent
chronometer
his
interior
vitality
was
warranted
to
do
well
in
all
climates
looking
into
his
eyes
you
seemed
to
see
there
the
yet
lingering
images
of
those
thousand-fold
perils
he
had
calmly
confronted
through
life
a
staid
steadfast
man
whose
life
for
the
most
part
was
a
telling
pantomime
of
action
and
not
a
tame
chapter
of
sounds
yet
for
all
his
hardy
sobriety
and
fortitude
there
were
certain
qualities
in
him
which
at
times
affected
and
in
some
cases
seemed
well
nigh
to
overbalance
all
the
rest
uncommonly
conscientious
for
a
seaman
and
endued
with
a
deep
natural
reverence
the
wild
watery
loneliness
of
his
life
did
therefore
strongly
incline
him
to
superstition
but
to
that
sort
of
superstition
which
in
some
organizations
seems
rather
to
spring
somehow
from
intelligence
than
from
ignorance
outward
portents
and
inward
presentiments
were
his
and
if
at
times
these
things
bent
the
welded
iron
of
his
soul
much
more
did
his
far-away
domestic
memories
of
his
young
cape
wife
and
child
tend
to
bend
him
still
more
from
the
original
ruggedness
of
his
nature
and
open
him
still
further
to
those
latent
influences
which
in
some
honest-hearted
men
restrain
the
gush
of
dare-devil
daring
so
often
evinced
by
others
in
the
more
perilous
vicissitudes
of
the
fishery
“i
will
have
no
man
in
my
boat,”
said
starbuck
“who
is
not
afraid
of
a
whale.”
by
this
he
seemed
to
mean
not
only
that
the
most
reliable
and
useful
courage
was
that
which
arises
from
the
fair
estimation
of
the
encountered
peril
but
that
an
utterly
fearless
man
is
a
far
more
dangerous
comrade
than
a
coward
“aye
aye,”
said
stubb
the
second
mate
“starbuck
there
is
as
careful
a
man
as
you’ll
find
anywhere
in
this
fishery.”
but
we
shall
ere
long
see
what
that
word
“careful”
precisely
means
when
used
by
a
man
like
stubb
or
almost
any
other
whale
hunter
starbuck
was
no
crusader
after
perils
in
him
courage
was
not
a
sentiment
but
a
thing
simply
useful
to
him
and
always
at
hand
upon
all
mortally
practical
occasions
besides
he
thought
perhaps
that
in
this
business
of
whaling
courage
was
one
of
the
great
staple
outfits
of
the
ship
like
her
beef
and
her
bread
and
not
to
be
foolishly
wasted
wherefore
he
had
no
fancy
for
lowering
for
whales
after
sun-down
nor
for
persisting
in
fighting
a
fish
that
too
much
persisted
in
fighting
him
for
thought
starbuck
i
am
here
in
this
critical
ocean
to
kill
whales
for
my
living
and
not
to
be
killed
by
them
for
theirs
and
that
hundreds
of
men
had
been
so
killed
starbuck
well
knew
what
doom
was
his
own
father’s
where
in
the
bottomless
deeps
could
he
find
the
torn
limbs
of
his
brother
with
memories
like
these
in
him
and
moreover
given
to
a
certain
superstitiousness
as
has
been
said
the
courage
of
this
starbuck
which
could
nevertheless
still
flourish
must
indeed
have
been
extreme
but
it
was
not
in
reasonable
nature
that
a
man
so
organized
and
with
such
terrible
experiences
and
remembrances
as
he
had
it
was
not
in
nature
that
these
things
should
fail
in
latently
engendering
an
element
in
him
which
under
suitable
circumstances
would
break
out
from
its
confinement
and
burn
all
his
courage
up
and
brave
as
he
might
be
it
was
that
sort
of
bravery
chiefly
visible
in
some
intrepid
men
which
while
generally
abiding
firm
in
the
conflict
with
seas
or
winds
or
whales
or
any
of
the
ordinary
irrational
horrors
of
the
world
yet
cannot
withstand
those
more
terrific
because
more
spiritual
terrors
which
sometimes
menace
you
from
the
concentrating
brow
of
an
enraged
and
mighty
man
but
were
the
coming
narrative
to
reveal
in
any
instance
the
complete
abasement
of
poor
starbuck’s
fortitude
scarce
might
i
have
the
heart
to
write
it
for
it
is
a
thing
most
sorrowful
nay
shocking
to
expose
the
fall
of
valour
in
the
soul
men
may
seem
detestable
as
joint
stock-companies
and
nations
knaves
fools
and
murderers
there
may
be
men
may
have
mean
and
meagre
faces
but
man
in
the
ideal
is
so
noble
and
so
sparkling
such
a
grand
and
glowing
creature
that
over
any
ignominious
blemish
in
him
all
his
fellows
should
run
to
throw
their
costliest
robes
that
immaculate
manliness
we
feel
within
ourselves
so
far
within
us
that
it
remains
intact
though
all
the
outer
character
seem
gone
bleeds
with
keenest
anguish
at
the
undraped
spectacle
of
a

knights
and
squires
stubb
was
the
second
mate
he
was
a
native
of
cape
cod
and
hence
according
to
local
usage
was
called
a
cape-cod-man
a
happy-go-lucky
neither
craven
nor
valiant
taking
perils
as
they
came
with
an
indifferent
air
and
while
engaged
in
the
most
imminent
crisis
of
the
chase
toiling
away
calm
and
collected
as
a
journeyman
joiner
engaged
for
the
year
good-humored
easy
and
careless
he
presided
over
his
whale-boat
as
if
the
most
deadly
encounter
were
but
a
dinner
and
his
crew
all
invited
guests
he
was
as
particular
about
the
comfortable
arrangement
of
his
part
of
the
boat
as
an
old
stage-driver
is
about
the
snugness
of
his
box
when
close
to
the
whale
in
the
very
death-lock
of
the
fight
he
handled
his
unpitying
lance
coolly
and
off-handedly
as
a
whistling
tinker
his
hammer
he
would
hum
over
his
old
rigadig
tunes
while
flank
and
flank
with
the
most
exasperated
monster
long
usage
had
for
this
stubb
converted
the
jaws
of
death
into
an
easy
chair
what
he
thought
of
death
itself
there
is
no
telling
whether
he
ever
thought
of
it
at
all
might
be
a
question
but
if
he
ever
did
chance
to
cast
his
mind
that
way
after
a
comfortable
dinner
no
doubt
like
a
good
sailor
he
took
it
to
be
a
sort
of
call
of
the
watch
to
tumble
aloft
and
bestir
themselves
there
about
something
which
he
would
find
out
when
he
obeyed
the
order
and
not
sooner
what
perhaps
with
other
things
made
stubb
such
an
easy-going
unfearing
man
so
cheerily
trudging
off
with
the
burden
of
life
in
a
world
full
of
grave
pedlars
all
bowed
to
the
ground
with
their
packs
what
helped
to
bring
about
that
almost
impious
good-humor
of
his
that
thing
must
have
been
his
pipe
for
like
his
nose
his
short
black
little
pipe
was
one
of
the
regular
features
of
his
face
you
would
almost
as
soon
have
expected
him
to
turn
out
of
his
bunk
without
his
nose
as
without
his
pipe
he
kept
a
whole
row
of
pipes
there
ready
loaded
stuck
in
a
rack
within
easy
reach
of
his
hand
and
whenever
he
turned
in
he
smoked
them
all
out
in
succession
lighting
one
from
the
other
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
then
loading
them
again
to
be
in
readiness
anew
for
when
stubb
dressed
instead
of
first
putting
his
legs
into
his
trowsers
he
put
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
i
say
this
continual
smoking
must
have
been
one
cause
at
least
of
his
peculiar
disposition
for
every
one
knows
that
this
earthly
air
whether
ashore
or
afloat
is
terribly
infected
with
the
nameless
miseries
of
the
numberless
mortals
who
have
died
exhaling
it
and
as
in
time
of
the
cholera
some
people
go
about
with
a
camphorated
handkerchief
to
their
mouths
so
likewise
against
all
mortal
tribulations
stubb’s
tobacco
smoke
might
have
operated
as
a
sort
of
disinfecting
agent
the
third
mate
was
flask
a
native
of
tisbury
in
martha’s
vineyard
a
short
stout
ruddy
young
fellow
very
pugnacious
concerning
whales
who
somehow
seemed
to
think
that
the
great
leviathans
had
personally
and
hereditarily
affronted
him
and
therefore
it
was
a
sort
of
point
of
honor
with
him
to
destroy
them
whenever
encountered
so
utterly
lost
was
he
to
all
sense
of
reverence
for
the
many
marvels
of
their
majestic
bulk
and
mystic
ways
and
so
dead
to
anything
like
an
apprehension
of
any
possible
danger
from
encountering
them
that
in
his
poor
opinion
the
wondrous
whale
was
but
a
species
of
magnified
mouse
or
at
least
water-rat
requiring
only
a
little
circumvention
and
some
small
application
of
time
and
trouble
in
order
to
kill
and
boil
this
ignorant
unconscious
fearlessness
of
his
made
him
a
little
waggish
in
the
matter
of
whales
he
followed
these
fish
for
the
fun
of
it
and
a
three
years’
voyage
round
cape
horn
was
only
a
jolly
joke
that
lasted
that
length
of
time
as
a
carpenter’s
nails
are
divided
into
wrought
nails
and
cut
nails
so
mankind
may
be
similarly
divided
little
flask
was
one
of
the
wrought
ones
made
to
clinch
tight
and
last
long
they
called
him
king-post
on
board
of
the
pequod
because
in
form
he
could
be
well
likened
to
the
short
square
timber
known
by
that
name
in
arctic
whalers
and
which
by
the
means
of
many
radiating
side
timbers
inserted
into
it
serves
to
brace
the
ship
against
the
icy
concussions
of
those
battering
seas
now
these
three
mates—starbuck
stubb
and
flask
were
momentous
men
they
it
was
who
by
universal
prescription
commanded
three
of
the
pequod’s
boats
as
headsmen
in
that
grand
order
of
battle
in
which
captain
ahab
would
probably
marshal
his
forces
to
descend
on
the
whales
these
three
headsmen
were
as
captains
of
companies
or
being
armed
with
their
long
keen
whaling
spears
they
were
as
a
picked
trio
of
lancers
even
as
the
harpooneers
were
flingers
of
javelins
and
since
in
this
famous
fishery
each
mate
or
headsman
like
a
gothic
knight
of
old
is
always
accompanied
by
his
boat-steerer
or
harpooneer
who
in
certain
conjunctures
provides
him
with
a
fresh
lance
when
the
former
one
has
been
badly
twisted
or
elbowed
in
the
assault
and
moreover
as
there
generally
subsists
between
the
two
a
close
intimacy
and
friendliness
it
is
therefore
but
meet
that
in
this
place
we
set
down
who
the
pequod’s
harpooneers
were
and
to
what
headsman
each
of
them
belonged
first
of
all
was
queequeg
whom
starbuck
the
chief
mate
had
selected
for
his
squire
but
queequeg
is
already
known
next
was
tashtego
an
unmixed
indian
from
gay
head
the
most
westerly
promontory
of
martha’s
vineyard
where
there
still
exists
the
last
remnant
of
a
village
of
red
men
which
has
long
supplied
the
neighboring
island
of
nantucket
with
many
of
her
most
daring
harpooneers
in
the
fishery
they
usually
go
by
the
generic
name
of
gay-headers
tashtego’s
long
lean
sable
hair
his
high
cheek
bones
and
black
rounding
eyes—for
an
indian
oriental
in
their
largeness
but
antarctic
in
their
glittering
expression—all
this
sufficiently
proclaimed
him
an
inheritor
of
the
unvitiated
blood
of
those
proud
warrior
hunters
who
in
quest
of
the
great
new
england
moose
had
scoured
bow
in
hand
the
aboriginal
forests
of
the
main
but
no
longer
snuffing
in
the
trail
of
the
wild
beasts
of
the
woodland
tashtego
now
hunted
in
the
wake
of
the
great
whales
of
the
sea
the
unerring
harpoon
of
the
son
fitly
replacing
the
infallible
arrow
of
the
sires
to
look
at
the
tawny
brawn
of
his
lithe
snaky
limbs
you
would
almost
have
credited
the
superstitions
of
some
of
the
earlier
puritans
and
half-believed
this
wild
indian
to
be
a
son
of
the
prince
of
the
powers
of
the
air
tashtego
was
stubb
the
second
mate’s
squire
third
among
the
harpooneers
was
daggoo
a
gigantic
coal-black
negro-savage
with
a
lion-like
tread—an
ahasuerus
to
behold
suspended
from
his
ears
were
two
golden
hoops
so
large
that
the
sailors
called
them
ring-bolts
and
would
talk
of
securing
the
top-sail
halyards
to
them
in
his
youth
daggoo
had
voluntarily
shipped
on
board
of
a
whaler
lying
in
a
lonely
bay
on
his
native
coast
and
never
having
been
anywhere
in
the
world
but
in
africa
nantucket
and
the
pagan
harbors
most
frequented
by
whalemen
and
having
now
led
for
many
years
the
bold
life
of
the
fishery
in
the
ships
of
owners
uncommonly
heedful
of
what
manner
of
men
they
shipped
daggoo
retained
all
his
barbaric
virtues
and
erect
as
a
giraffe
moved
about
the
decks
in
all
the
pomp
of
six
feet
five
in
his
socks
there
was
a
corporeal
humility
in
looking
up
at
him
and
a
white
man
standing
before
him
seemed
a
white
flag
come
to
beg
truce
of
a
fortress
curious
to
tell
this
imperial
negro
ahasuerus
daggoo
was
the
squire
of
little
flask
who
looked
like
a
chess-man
beside
him
as
for
the
residue
of
the
pequod’s
company
be
it
said
that
at
the
present
day
not
one
in
two
of
the
many
thousand
men
before
the
mast
employed
in
the
american
whale
fishery
are
americans
born
though
pretty
nearly
all
the
officers
are
herein
it
is
the
same
with
the
american
whale
fishery
as
with
the
american
army
and
military
and
merchant
navies
and
the
engineering
forces
employed
in
the
construction
of
the
american
canals
and
railroads
the
same
i
say
because
in
all
these
cases
the
native
american
liberally
provides
the
brains
the
rest
of
the
world
as
generously
supplying
the
muscles
no
small
number
of
these
whaling
seamen
belong
to
the
azores
where
the
outward
bound
nantucket
whalers
frequently
touch
to
augment
their
crews
from
the
hardy
peasants
of
those
rocky
shores
in
like

the
greenland
whalers
sailing
out

in

the
shetland
islands

receive
the
full
complement
of
their

upon
the

homewards
they
drop
them
there
again
how
it
is
there
is
no
telling
but

to
make

ahab
for
several
days
after
leaving
nantucket
nothing
above
hatches
was
seen
of
captain
ahab
the
mates
regularly
relieved
each
other
at
the
watches
and
for
aught
that
could
be
seen
to
the
contrary
they
seemed
to
be
the
only
commanders
of
the
ship
only
they
sometimes
issued
from
the
cabin
with
orders
so
sudden
and
peremptory
that
after
all
it
was
plain
they
but
commanded
vicariously
yes
their
supreme
lord
and
dictator
was
there
though
hitherto
unseen
by
any
eyes
not
permitted
to
penetrate
into
the
now
sacred
retreat
of
the
cabin
every
time
i
ascended
to
the
deck
from
my
watches
below
i
instantly
gazed
aft
to
mark
if
any
strange
face
were
visible
for
my
first
vague
disquietude
touching
the
unknown
captain
now
in
the
seclusion
of
the
sea
became
almost
a
perturbation
this
was
strangely
heightened
at
times
by
the
ragged
elijah’s
diabolical
incoherences
uninvitedly
recurring
to
me
with
a
subtle
energy
i
could
not
have
before
conceived
of
but
poorly
could
i
withstand
them
much
as
in
other
moods
i
was
almost
ready
to
smile
at
the
solemn
whimsicalities
of
that
outlandish
prophet
of
the
wharves
but
whatever
it
was
of
apprehensiveness
or
uneasiness—to
call
it
so—which
i
felt
yet
whenever
i
came
to
look
about
me
in
the
ship
it
seemed
against
all
warrantry
to
cherish
such
emotions
for
though
the
harpooneers
with
the
great
body
of
the
crew
were
a
far
more
barbaric
heathenish
and
motley
set
than
any
of
the
tame
merchant-ship
companies
which
my
previous
experiences
had
made
me
acquainted
with
still
i
ascribed
this—and
rightly
ascribed
it—to
the
fierce
uniqueness
of
the
very
nature
of
that
wild
scandinavian
vocation
in
which
i
had
so
abandonedly
embarked
but
it
was
especially
the
aspect
of
the
three
chief
officers
of
the
ship
the
mates
which
was
most
forcibly
calculated
to
allay
these
colourless
misgivings
and
induce
confidence
and
cheerfulness
in
every
presentment
of
the
voyage
three
better
more
likely
sea-officers
and
men
each
in
his
own
different
way
could
not
readily
be
found
and
they
were
every
one
of
them
americans
a
nantucketer
a
vineyarder
a
cape
man
now
it
being
christmas
when
the
ship
shot
from
out
her
harbor
for
a
space
we
had
biting
polar
weather
though
all
the
time
running
away
from
it
to
the
southward
and
by
every
degree
and
minute
of
latitude
which
we
sailed
gradually
leaving
that
merciless
winter
and
all
its
intolerable
weather
behind
us
it
was
one
of
those
less
lowering
but
still
grey
and
gloomy
enough
mornings
of
the
transition
when
with
a
fair
wind
the
ship
was
rushing
through
the
water
with
a
vindictive
sort
of
leaping
and
melancholy
rapidity
that
as
i
mounted
to
the
deck
at
the
call
of
the
forenoon
watch
so
soon
as
i
levelled
my
glance
towards
the
taffrail
foreboding
shivers
ran
over
me
reality
outran
apprehension
captain
ahab
stood
upon
his
quarter-deck
there
seemed
no
sign
of
common
bodily
illness
about
him
nor
of
the
recovery
from
any
he
looked
like
a
man
cut
away
from
the
stake
when
the
fire
has
overrunningly
wasted
all
the
limbs
without
consuming
them
or
taking
away
one
particle
from
their
compacted
aged
robustness
his
whole
high
broad
form
seemed
made
of
solid
bronze
and
shaped
in
an
unalterable
mould
like
cellini’s
cast
perseus
threading
its
way
out
from
among
his
grey
hairs
and
continuing
right
down
one
side
of
his
tawny
scorched
face
and
neck
till
it
disappeared
in
his
clothing
you
saw
a
slender
rod-like
mark
lividly
whitish
it
resembled
that
perpendicular
seam
sometimes
made
in
the
straight
lofty
trunk
of
a
great
tree
when
the
upper
lightning
tearingly
darts
down
it
and
without
wrenching
a
single
twig
peels
and
grooves
out
the
bark
from
top
to
bottom
ere
running
off
into
the
soil
leaving
the
tree
still
greenly
alive
but
branded
whether
that
mark
was
born
with
him
or
whether
it
was
the
scar
left
by
some
desperate
wound
no
one
could
certainly
say
by
some
tacit
consent
throughout
the
voyage
little
or
no
allusion
was
made
to
it
especially
by
the
mates
but
once
tashtego’s
senior
an
old
gay-head
indian
among
the
crew
superstitiously
asserted
that
not
till
he
was
full
forty
years
old
did
ahab
become
that
way
branded
and
then
it
came
upon
him
not
in
the
fury
of
any
mortal
fray
but
in
an
elemental
strife
at
sea
yet
this
wild
hint
seemed
inferentially
negatived
by
what
a
grey
manxman
insinuated
an
old
sepulchral
man
who
having
never
before
sailed
out
of
nantucket
had
never
ere
this
laid
eye
upon
wild
ahab
nevertheless
the
old
sea-traditions
the
immemorial
credulities
popularly
invested
this
old
manxman
with
preternatural
powers
of
discernment
so
that
no
white
sailor
seriously
contradicted
him
when
he
said
that
if
ever
captain
ahab
should
be
tranquilly
laid
out—which
might
hardly
come
to
pass
so
he
muttered—then
whoever
should
do
that
last
office
for
the
dead
would
find
a
birth-mark
on
him
from
crown
to
sole
so
powerfully
did
the
whole
grim
aspect
of
ahab
affect
me
and
the
livid
brand
which
streaked
it
that
for
the
first
few
moments
i
hardly
noted
that
not
a
little
of
this
overbearing
grimness
was
owing
to
the
barbaric
white
leg
upon
which
he
partly
stood
it
had
previously
come
to
me
that
this
ivory
leg
had
at
sea
been
fashioned
from
the
polished
bone
of
the
sperm
whale’s
jaw
“aye
he
was
dismasted
off
japan,”
said
the
old
gay-head
indian
once
“but
like
his
dismasted
craft
he
shipped
another
mast
without
coming
home
for
it
he
has
a
quiver
of
’em.”
i
was
struck
with
the
singular
posture
he
maintained
upon
each
side
of
the
pequod’s
quarter
deck
and
pretty
close
to
the
mizzen
shrouds
there
was
an
auger
hole
bored
about
half
an
inch
or
so
into
the
plank
his
bone
leg
steadied
in
that
hole
one
arm
elevated
and
holding
by
a
shroud
captain
ahab
stood
erect
looking
straight
out
beyond
the
ship’s
ever-pitching
prow
there
was
an
infinity
of
firmest
fortitude
a
determinate
unsurrenderable
wilfulness
in
the
fixed
and
fearless
forward
dedication
of
that
glance
not
a
word
he
spoke
nor
did
his
officers
say
aught
to
him
though
by
all
their
minutest
gestures
and
expressions
they
plainly
showed
the
uneasy
if
not
painful
consciousness
of
being
under
a
troubled
master-eye
and
not
only
that
but
moody
stricken
ahab
stood
before
them
with
a
crucifixion
in
his
face
in
all
the
nameless
regal
overbearing
dignity
of
some
mighty
woe
ere
long
from
his
first
visit
in
the
air
he
withdrew
into
his
cabin
but
after
that
morning
he
was
every
day
visible
to
the
crew
either
standing
in
his
pivot-hole
or
seated
upon
an
ivory
stool
he
had
or
heavily
walking
the
deck
as
the
sky
grew
less
gloomy
indeed
began
to
grow
a
little
genial
he
became
still
less
and
less
a
recluse
as
if
when
the
ship
had
sailed
from
home
nothing
but
the
dead
wintry
bleakness
of
the
sea
had
then
kept
him
so
secluded
and
by
and
by
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
almost
continually
in
the
air
but
as
yet
for
all
that
he
said
or
perceptibly
did
on
the
at
last
sunny
deck
he
seemed
as
unnecessary
there
as
another
mast
but
the
pequod
was
only
making
a
passage

that
there
was

or
nothing
out
of

to
employ
or
excite
ahab
now
and
thus
chase
away
for
that
one
interval
the
clouds
that
layer
upon
layer
were
piled
upon
his
brow
as
ever
all
clouds
choose
the
loftiest
peaks
to
pile
themselves
upon
nevertheless
ere
long
the
warm
warbling
persuasiveness
of
the
pleasant
holiday
weather
we
came
to
seemed
gradually
to
charm
him
from
his
mood

ahab
did
in
the
end
a
little
respond
to
the
playful
allurings
of
that
girlish
air
more
than
once
did
he
put

the

look

to

it
was
so
with
ahab
only
that
now
of
late
he
seemed
so
much
to
live
in
the
open
air
that
truly
speaking
his
visits
were
more
to
the
cabin
than
from
the
cabin
to
the
planks
“it
feels
like
going
down
into
one’s
tomb,”—he
would
mutter
to
himself—“for
an
old
captain
like
me
to
be
descending
this
narrow
scuttle
to
go
to
my
grave-dug
berth.”
so
almost
every
twenty-four
hours
when
the
watches
of
the
night
were
set
and
the
band
on
deck
sentinelled
the
slumbers
of
the
band
below
and
when
if
a
rope
was
to
be
hauled
upon
the
forecastle
the
sailors
flung
it
not
rudely
down
as
by
day
but
with
some
cautiousness
dropt
it
to
its
place
for
fear
of
disturbing
their
slumbering
shipmates
when
this
sort
of
steady
quietude
would
begin
to
prevail
habitually
the
silent
steersman
would
watch
the
cabin-scuttle
and
ere
long
the
old
man
would
emerge
gripping
at
the
iron
banister
to
help
his
crippled
way
some
considering
touch
of
humanity
was
in
him
for
at
times
like
these
he
usually
abstained
from
patrolling
the
quarter-deck
because
to
his
wearied
mates
seeking
repose
within
six
inches
of
his
ivory
heel
such
would
have
been
the
reverberating
crack
and
din
of
that
bony
step
that
their
dreams
would
have
been
on
the
crunching
teeth
of
sharks
but
once
the
mood
was
on
him
too
deep
for
common
regardings
and
as
with
heavy
lumber-like
pace
he
was
measuring
the
ship
from
taffrail
to
mainmast
stubb
the
old
second
mate
came
up
from
below
with
a
certain
unassured
deprecating
humorousness
hinted
that
if
captain
ahab
was
pleased
to
walk
the
planks
then
no
one
could
say
nay
but
there
might
be
some
way
of
muffling
the
noise
hinting
something
indistinctly
and
hesitatingly
about
a
globe
of
tow
and
the
insertion
into
it
of
the
ivory
heel
ah
stubb
thou
didst
not
know
ahab
then
“am
i
a
cannon-ball
stubb,”
said
ahab
“that
thou
wouldst
wad
me
that
fashion
but
go
thy
ways
i
had
forgot
below
to
thy
nightly
grave
where
such
as
ye
sleep
between
shrouds
to
use
ye
to
the
filling
one
at
last.—down
dog
and
kennel!”
starting
at
the
unforseen
concluding
exclamation
of
the
so
suddenly
scornful
old
man
stubb
was
speechless
a
moment
then
said
excitedly
“i
am
not
used
to
be
spoken
to
that
way
sir
i
do
but
less
than
half
like
it
sir.”
“avast
gritted
ahab
between
his
set
teeth
and
violently
moving
away
as
if
to
avoid
some
passionate
temptation
“no
sir
not
yet,”
said
stubb
emboldened
“i
will
not
tamely
be
called
a
dog
sir.”
“then
be
called
ten
times
a
donkey
and
a
mule
and
an
ass
and
begone
or
i’ll
clear
the
world
of
thee!”
as
he
said
this
ahab
advanced
upon
him
with
such
overbearing
terrors
in
his
aspect
that
stubb
involuntarily
retreated
“i
was
never
served
so
before
without
giving
a
hard
blow
for
it,”
muttered
stubb
as
he
found
himself
descending
the
cabin-scuttle
“it’s
very
queer
stop
stubb
somehow
now
i
don’t
well
know
whether
to
go
back
and
strike
him
or—what’s
that?—down
here
on
my
knees
and
pray
for
him
yes
that
was
the
thought
coming
up
in
me
but
it
would
be
the
first
time
i
ever
_did_
pray
it’s
queer
very
queer
and
he’s
queer
too
aye
take
him
fore
and
aft
he’s
about
the
queerest
old
man
stubb
ever
sailed
with
how
he
flashed
at
me!—his
eyes
like
powder-pans
is
he
mad
anyway
there’s
something
on
his
mind
as
sure
as
there
must
be
something
on
a
deck
when
it
cracks
he
aint
in
his
bed
now
either
more
than
three
hours
out
of
the
twenty-four
and
he
don’t
sleep
then
didn’t
that
dough-boy
the
steward
tell
me
that
of
a
morning
he
always
finds
the
old
man’s
hammock
clothes
all
rumpled
and
tumbled
and
the
sheets
down
at
the
foot
and
the
coverlid
almost
tied
into
knots
and
the
pillow
a
sort
of
frightful
hot
as
though
a
baked
brick
had
been
on
it
a
hot
old
man
i
guess
he’s
got
what
some
folks
ashore
call
a
conscience
it’s
a
kind
of
tic-dolly-row
they
say—worse
nor
a
toothache
well
well
i
don’t
know
what
it
is
but
the
lord
keep
me
from
catching
it
he’s
full
of
riddles
i
wonder
what
he
goes
into
the
after
hold
for
every
night
as
dough-boy
tells
me
he
suspects
what’s
that
for
i
should
like
to
know
who’s
made
appointments
with
him
in
the
hold
ain’t
that
queer
now
but
there’s
no
telling
it’s
the
old
game—here
goes
for
a
snooze
damn
me
it’s
worth
a
fellow’s
while
to
be
born
into
the
world
if
only
to
fall
right
asleep
and
now
that
i
think
of
it
that’s
about
the
first
thing
babies
do
and
that’s
a
sort
of
queer
too
damn
me
but
all
things
are
queer
come
to
think
of
’em
but
that’s
against
my
principles
think
not
is
my
eleventh
commandment
and
sleep
when
you
can
is
my
twelfth—so
here
goes
again
but
how’s
that
didn’t
he
call
me
a
dog
blazes
he
called
me
ten
times
a
donkey
and
piled
a
lot
of
jackasses
on
top
of
_that!_
he
might
as
well
have
kicked
me
and
done
with
it
maybe
he
_did_
kick
me
and
i
didn’t
observe
it
i
was
so
taken
all
aback
with
his
brow
somehow
it
flashed
like
a
bleached
bone
what
the
devil’s
the
matter
with
me
i
don’t
stand
right
on
my
legs
coming
afoul
of
that
old
man
has
a
sort
of
turned
me
wrong
side
out
by
the
lord
i
must
have
been
dreaming
though—how
how
how?—but
the
only
way’s
to
stash
it
so
here
goes
to
hammock
again
and
in
the
morning
i’ll
see
how
this
plaguey
juggling
thinks
over
by
daylight.”

over

bulwarks

then
as
had
been
usual
with
him
of
late
calling
a
sailor
of
the
watch
he
sent
him
below
for
his
ivory
stool
and
also
his
pipe
lighting
the
pipe
at
the
binnacle
lamp
and
planting
the
stool
on
the
weather
side
of
the
deck
he
sat
and
smoked
in
old
norse
times
the
thrones
of
the
sea-loving
danish
kings
were
fabricated
saith
tradition
of
the
tusks
of
the
narwhale
how
could
one
look
at
ahab
then
seated
on
that
tripod
of
bones
without
bethinking
him
of
the
royalty
it
symbolized
for
a
khan
of
the
plank
and
a
king
of
the
sea
and
a
great
lord
of
leviathans
was
ahab
some
moments
passed
during
which
the
thick
vapor
came
from
his
mouth
in
quick
and
constant
puffs
which
blew
back
again
into
his
face
“how
now,”
he
soliloquized
at
last
withdrawing
the
tube
“this
smoking
no
longer
soothes
oh
my
pipe
hard
must
it
go
with
me
if
thy
charm
be
gone
here
have
i
been
unconsciously
toiling
not
pleasuring—aye
and
ignorantly
smoking
to
windward
all
the
while
to
windward
and
with
such
nervous
whiffs
as
if
like
the
dying
whale
my
final
jets
were
the
strongest
and
fullest
of
trouble
what
business

send
up
mild
white
vapors
among
mild
white
hairs
not
among
torn
iron-grey
locks

mine
i’ll
smoke
no
more—”
he
tossed
the
still
lighted
pipe
into
the
sea
the
fire
hissed
in
the
waves

instant

queen

next
morning
stubb
accosted
flask
“such
a
queer
dream
king-post
i
never
had
you
know
the
old
man’s
ivory
leg
well
i
dreamed
he
kicked
me
with
it
and
when
i
tried
to
kick
back
upon
my
soul
my
little
man
i
kicked
my
leg
right
off
and
then
presto
ahab
seemed
a
pyramid
and
i
like
a
blazing
fool
kept
kicking
at
it
but
what
was
still
more
curious
flask—you
know
how
curious
all
dreams
are—through
all
this
rage
that
i
was
in
i
somehow
seemed
to
be
thinking
to
myself
that
after
all
it
was
not
much
of
an
insult
that
kick
from
ahab
‘why,’
thinks
i
‘what’s
the
row
it’s
not
a
real
leg
only
a
false
leg.’
and
there’s
a
mighty
difference
between
a
living
thump
and
a
dead
thump
that’s
what
makes
a
blow
from
the
hand
flask
fifty
times
more
savage
to
bear
than
a
blow
from
a
cane
the
living
member—that
makes
the
living
insult
my
little
man
and
thinks
i
to
myself
all
the
while
mind
while
i
was
stubbing
my
silly
toes
against
that
cursed
pyramid—so
confoundedly
contradictory
was
it
all
all
the
while
i
say
i
was
thinking
to
myself
‘what’s
his
leg
now
but
a
cane—a
whalebone
cane
yes,’
thinks
i
‘it
was
only
a
playful
cudgelling—in
fact
only
a
whaleboning
that
he
gave
me—not
a
base
kick
besides,’
thinks
i
‘look
at
it
once
why
the
end
of
it—the
foot
part—what
a
small
sort
of
end
it
is
whereas
if
a
broad
footed
farmer
kicked
me
_there’s_
a
devilish
broad
insult
but
this
insult
is
whittled
down
to
a
point
only.’
but
now
comes
the
greatest
joke
of
the
dream
flask
while
i
was
battering
away
at
the
pyramid
a
sort
of
badger-haired
old
merman
with
a
hump
on
his
back
takes
me
by
the
shoulders
and
slews
me
round
‘what
are
you
’bout?’
says
he
slid
man
but
i
was
frightened
such
a
phiz
but
somehow
next
moment
i
was
over
the
fright
‘what
am
i
about?’
says
i
at
last
‘and
what
business
is
that
of
yours
i
should
like
to
know
mr
humpback
do
_you_
want

by
the
lord
flask
i
had
no
sooner
said
that
than
he
turned
round
his
stern
to
me
bent
over
and
dragging
up
a
lot
of
seaweed
he
had
for
a
clout—what
do
you
think
i
saw?—why
thunder
alive
man
his
stern
was
stuck
full
of
marlinspikes
with
the
points
out
says
i
on
second
thoughts
‘i
guess
i
won’t
kick
you
old
fellow.’
‘wise
stubb,’
said
he
‘wise
stubb;’
and
kept
muttering
it
all
the
time
a
sort
of
eating
of
his
own
gums
like
a
chimney
hag
seeing
he
wasn’t
going
to
stop
saying
over
his
‘wise
stubb
wise
stubb,’
i
thought
i
might
as
well
fall
to
kicking
the
pyramid
again
but
i
had
only
just
lifted
my
foot
for
it
when
he
roared
out
‘stop
that
kicking!’
‘halloa,’
says
i
‘what’s
the
matter
now
old
fellow?’
‘look
ye
here,’
says
he
‘let’s
argue
the
insult
captain
ahab
kicked
ye
didn’t
he?’
‘yes
he
did,’
says
i—‘right
_here_
it
was.’
‘very
good,’
says
he—‘he
used
his
ivory
leg
didn’t
he?’
‘yes
he
did,’
says
i
‘well
then,’
says
he
‘wise
stubb
what
have
you
to
complain
of
didn’t
he
kick
with
right
good
will
it
wasn’t
a
common

with

it
no
you
were
kicked
by
a
great
man
and
with
a
beautiful
ivory

it’s
an
honor
i
consider
it
an
honor
listen

in
old
england
the
greatest
lords
think
it
great
glory
to
be
slapped
by
a
queen
and
made
garter-knights
of
but
be
_your_
boast
stubb
that
ye
were
kicked
by
old
ahab
and
made
a

man
of
remember
what

his

and
on
no

help
yourself

you

with
that
he
all
of
a
sudden
seemed
somehow
in
some
queer
fashion
to
swim
off
into
the
air
i
snored
rolled
over
and
there
i
was
in
my
hammock
now
what
do
you
think
of

“i
don’t

“may

d’ye
see
ahab
standing
there

looking

to

alone
never

“mast-head

there
are

and
so
in
some

with

the

of

many
are
the

old
and

who
have
at

i

on
the
separate
subject
of
the

he
is
the
best
existing
authority
but
scoresby
knew
nothing
and
says
nothing
of
the
great
sperm
whale
compared
with
which
the
greenland
whale
is
almost
unworthy
mentioning
and
here
be
it
said
that
the
greenland
whale
is
an
usurper
upon
the
throne
of
the
seas
he
is
not
even
by
any
means
the
largest
of
the
whales
yet
owing
to
the
long
priority
of
his
claims
and
the
profound
ignorance
which
till
some
seventy
years
back
invested
the
then
fabulous
or
utterly
unknown
sperm-whale
and
which
ignorance
to
this
present
day
still
reigns
in
all
but
some
few
scientific
retreats
and
whale-ports
this
usurpation
has
been
every
way
complete
reference
to
nearly
all
the
leviathanic
allusions
in
the
great
poets
of
past
days
will
satisfy
you
that
the
greenland
whale
without
one
rival
was
to
them
the
monarch
of
the
seas
but
the
time
has
at
last
come
for
a
new
proclamation
this
is
charing
cross
hear
ye
good
people
all,—the
greenland
whale
is
deposed,—the
great
sperm
whale
now
reigneth
there
are
only
two
books
in
being
which
at
all
pretend
to
put
the
living
sperm
whale
before
you
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
remotest
degree
succeed
in
the
attempt
those
books
are
beale’s
and
bennett’s
both
in
their
time
surgeons
to
english
south-sea
whale-ships
and
both
exact
and
reliable
men
the
original
matter
touching
the
sperm
whale
to
be
found
in
their
volumes
is
necessarily
small
but
so
far
as
it
goes
it
is
of
excellent
quality
though
mostly
confined
to
scientific
description
as
yet
however
the
sperm
whale
scientific
or
poetic
lives
not
complete
in
any
literature
far
above
all
other
hunted
whales
his
is
an
unwritten
life
now
the
various
species
of
whales
need
some
sort
of
popular
comprehensive
classification
if
only
an
easy
outline
one
for
the
present
hereafter
to
be
filled
in
all
its
departments
by
subsequent
laborers
as
no
better
man
advances
to
take
this
matter
in
hand
i
hereupon
offer
my
own
poor
endeavors
i
promise
nothing
complete
because
any
human
thing
supposed
to
be
complete
must
for
that
very
reason
infallibly
be
faulty
i
shall
not
pretend
to
a
minute
anatomical
description
of
the
various
species
or—in
this
place
at
least—to
much
of
any
description
my
object
here
is
simply
to
project
the
draught
of
a
systematization
of
cetology
i
am
the
architect
not
the
builder
but
it
is
a
ponderous
task
no
ordinary
letter-sorter
in
the
post-office
is
equal
to
it
to
grope
down
into
the
bottom
of
the
sea
after
them
to
have
one’s
hands
among
the
unspeakable
foundations
ribs
and
very
pelvis
of
the
world
this
is
a
fearful
thing
what
am
i
that
i
should
essay
to
hook
the
nose
of
this
leviathan
the
awful
tauntings
in
job
might
well
appal
me
will
he
the
leviathan
make
a
covenant
with
thee
behold
the
hope
of
him
is
vain
but
i
have
swam
through
libraries
and
sailed
through
oceans
i
have
had
to
do
with
whales
with
these
visible
hands
i
am
in
earnest
and
i
will
try
there
are
some
preliminaries
to
settle
first
the
uncertain
unsettled
condition
of
this
science
of
cetology
is
in
the
very
vestibule
attested
by
the
fact
that
in
some
quarters
it
still
remains
a
moot
point
whether
a
whale
be
a
fish
in
his
system
of
nature
a.d
1776
linnæus
declares
“i
hereby
separate
the
whales
from
the
fish.”
but
of
my
own
knowledge
i
know
that
down
to
the
year
1850
sharks
and
shad
alewives
and
herring
against
linnæus’s
express
edict
were
still
found
dividing
the
possession
of
the
same
seas
with
the
leviathan
the
grounds
upon
which
linnæus
would
fain
have
banished
the
whales
from
the
waters
he
states
as
follows
“on
account
of
their
warm
bilocular
heart
their
lungs
their
movable
eyelids
their
hollow
ears
penem
intrantem
feminam
mammis
lactantem,”
and
finally
“ex
lege
naturæ
jure
meritoque.”
i
submitted
all
this
to
my
friends
simeon
macey
and
charley
coffin
of
nantucket
both
messmates
of
mine
in
a
certain
voyage
and
they
united
in
the
opinion
that
the
reasons
set
forth
were
altogether
insufficient
charley
profanely
hinted
they
were
humbug
be
it
known
that
waiving
all
argument
i
take
the
good
old
fashioned
ground
that
the
whale
is
a
fish
and
call
upon
holy
jonah
to
back
me
this
fundamental
thing
settled
the
next
point
is
in
what
internal
respect
does
the
whale
differ
from
other
fish
above
linnæus
has
given
you
those
items
but
in
brief
they
are
these
lungs
and
warm
blood
whereas
all
other
fish
are
lungless
and
cold
blooded
next
how
shall
we
define
the
whale
by
his
obvious
externals
so
as
conspicuously
to
label
him
for
all
time
to
come
to
be
short
then
a
whale
is
_a
spouting
fish
with
a
horizontal
tail_
there
you
have
him
however
contracted
that
definition
is
the
result
of
expanded
meditation
a
walrus
spouts
much
like
a
whale
but
the
walrus
is
not
a
fish
because
he
is
amphibious
but
the
last
term
of
the
definition
is
still
more
cogent
as
coupled
with
the
first
almost
any
one
must
have
noticed
that
all
the
fish
familiar
to
landsmen
have
not
a
flat
but
a
vertical
or
up-and-down
tail
whereas
among
spouting
fish
the
tail
though
it
may
be
similarly
shaped
invariably
assumes
a
horizontal
position
by
the
above
definition
of
what
a
whale
is
i
do
by
no
means
exclude
from
the
leviathanic
brotherhood
any
sea
creature
hitherto
identified
with
the
whale
by
the
best
informed
nantucketers
nor
on
the
other
hand
link
with
it
any
fish
hitherto
authoritatively
regarded
as
alien.*
hence
all
the
smaller
spouting
and
horizontal
tailed
fish
must
be
included
in
this
ground-plan
of
cetology
now
then
come
the
grand
divisions
of
the
entire
whale
host
*i
am
aware
that
down
to
the
present
time
the
fish
styled
lamatins
and
dugongs
pig-fish
and
sow-fish
of
the
coffins
of
nantucket
are
included
by
many
naturalists
among
the
whales
but
as
these
pig-fish
are
a
noisy
contemptible
set
mostly
lurking
in
the
mouths
of
rivers
and
feeding
on
wet
hay
and
especially
as
they
do
not
spout
i
deny
their
credentials
as
whales
and
have
presented
them
with
their
passports
to
quit
the
kingdom
of
cetology
first
according
to
magnitude
i
divide
the
whales
into
three
primary
books

into
chapters

with

i
now
have
to
do
philologically
considered
it
is
absurd
some
centuries
ago
when
the
sperm
whale
was
almost
wholly
unknown
in
his
own
proper
individuality
and
when
his
oil
was
only
accidentally
obtained
from
the
stranded

those
days

would
seem
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
derived
from
a
creature
identical
with
the
one
then
known
in
england
as
the
greenland
or
right
whale
it
was
the
idea
also
that
this
same
spermaceti
was
that
quickening
humor
of
the
greenland
whale
which
the
first
syllable
of
the
word
literally
expresses
in
those
times
also
spermaceti
was
exceedingly
scarce

being
used
for

only
as

to
be
had
from
the
druggists
as
you
nowadays
buy
an
ounce
of
rhubarb
when
as
i
opine
in
the
course
of
time
the
true
nature
of
spermaceti
became
known
its
original
name
was
still
retained
by
the
dealers
no
doubt
to
enhance
its
value
by
a
notion
so
strangely
significant
of
its
scarcity
and
so

appellation
must
at
last
have
come
to
be
bestowed
upon

was
really
derived

endless
subdivisions
based
upon
the
most
inconclusive
differences
that
some
departments
of
natural
history
become
so
repellingly
intricate
the
right
whale
will
be
elsewhere
treated
of
at
some
length
with
reference

elucidating
the

_fin-back_).—under
this
head
i
reckon
a
monster
which
by
the
various
names
of
fin-back
tall-spout
and
long-john
has
been
seen
almost
in
every
sea
and
is
commonly
the
whale
whose
distant
jet
is
so
often
descried
by
passengers
crossing
the
atlantic
in
the
new
york
packet-tracks
in
the
length
he
attains
and
in
his
baleen
the
fin-back
resembles
the
right
whale
but
is
of
a
less
portly
girth
and
a
lighter
colour
approaching
to
olive
his
great
lips
present
a
cable-like
aspect
formed
by
the
intertwisting
slanting
folds
of
large
wrinkles
his
grand
distinguishing
feature
the
fin
from
which
he
derives
his
name
is
often
a
conspicuous
object
this
fin
is
some
three
or
four
feet
long
growing
vertically
from
the
hinder
part
of
the
back
of
an
angular
shape
and
with
a
very
sharp
pointed
end
even
if
not
the
slightest
other
part
of
the
creature
be
visible
this
isolated
fin
will
at
times
be
seen
plainly
projecting
from
the
surface
when
the
sea
is
moderately
calm
and
slightly
marked
with
spherical
ripples
and
this
gnomon-like
fin
stands
up
and
casts
shadows
upon
the
wrinkled
surface
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
the
watery
circle
surrounding
it
somewhat
resembles
a
dial
with
its
style
and
wavy
hour-lines
graved
on
it
on
that
ahaz-dial
the
shadow
often
goes
back
the
fin-back
is
not
gregarious
he
seems
a
whale-hater
as
some
men
are
man-haters
very
shy
always
going
solitary
unexpectedly
rising
to
the
surface
in
the
remotest
and
most
sullen
waters
his
straight
and
single
lofty
jet
rising
like
a
tall
misanthropic
spear
upon
a
barren
plain
gifted
with
such
wondrous
power
and
velocity
in
swimming
as
to
defy
all
present
pursuit
from
man
this
leviathan
seems
the
banished
and
unconquerable
cain
of
his
race
bearing
for
his
mark
that
style
upon
his
back
from
having
the
baleen
in
his
mouth
the
fin-back
is
sometimes
included
with
the
right
whale
among
a
theoretic
species
denominated
_whalebone
whales_
that
is
whales
with
baleen
of
these
so
called
whalebone
whales
there
would
seem
to
be
several
varieties
most
of
which
however
are
little
known
broad-nosed
whales
and
beaked
whales
pike-headed
whales
bunched
whales
under-jawed
whales
and
rostrated
whales
are
the
fishermen’s
names
for
a
few
sorts
in
connection
with
this
appellative
of
“whalebone
whales,”
it
is
of
great
importance
to
mention
that
however
such
a
nomenclature
may
be
convenient
in
facilitating
allusions
to
some
kind
of
whales
yet
it
is
in
vain
to
attempt
a
clear
classification
of
the
leviathan
founded
upon
either
his
baleen
or
hump
or
fin
or
teeth
notwithstanding
that
those
marked
parts
or
features
very
obviously
seem
better
adapted
to
afford
the
basis
for
a
regular
system
of
cetology
than
any
other
detached
bodily
distinctions
which
the
whale
in
his
kinds
presents
how
then
the
baleen
hump
back-fin
and
teeth
these
are
things
whose
peculiarities
are
indiscriminately
dispersed
among
all
sorts
of
whales
without
any
regard
to
what
may
be
the
nature
of
their
structure
in
other
and
more
essential
particulars
thus
the
sperm
whale
and
the
humpbacked
whale
each
has
a
hump
but
there
the
similitude
ceases
then
this
same
humpbacked
whale
and
the
greenland
whale
each
of
these
has
baleen
but
there
again
the
similitude
ceases
and
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
other
parts
above
mentioned
in
various
sorts
of
whales
they
form
such
irregular
combinations
or
in
the
case
of
any
one
of
them
detached
such
an
irregular
isolation
as
utterly
to
defy
all
general
methodization
formed
upon
such
a
basis
on
this
rock
every
one
of
the
whale-naturalists
has
split
but
it
may
possibly
be
conceived
that
in
the
internal
parts
of
the
whale
in
his
anatomy—there
at
least
we
shall
be
able
to
hit
the
right
classification
nay
what
thing
for
example
is
there
in
the
greenland
whale’s
anatomy
more
striking
than
his
baleen
yet
we
have
seen
that
by
his
baleen
it
is
impossible
correctly
to
classify
the
greenland
whale
and
if
you
descend
into
the
bowels
of
the
various
leviathans
why
there
you
will
not
find
distinctions
a
fiftieth
part
as
available
to
the
systematizer
as
those
external
ones
already
enumerated
what
then
remains
nothing
but
to
take
hold
of
the
whales
bodily
in
their
entire
liberal
volume
and
boldly
sort
them
that
way
and
this
is
the
bibliographical
system
here
adopted
and
it
is
the
only
one
that
can
possibly
succeed
for
it
alone

practicable

you

distinguish
him

valuable

*why

retain
a
proportionate
likeness
to

this

rather
blowing
has
furnished

proverb
to
landsmen
is
so
well
known
a
denizen
of

yet
is
he
not
popularly
classed
among
whales
but
possessing
all
the
grand
distinctive
features
of
the
leviathan

naturalists
have
recognised

_black
fish_).—i
give
the
popular
fishermen’s
names
for
all
these
fish
for
generally
they
are
the
best
where
any
name
happens
to
be
vague
or
inexpressive
i
shall
say
so
and
suggest
another
i
do
so
now
touching
the
black
fish
so-called
because
blackness
is
the
rule
among
almost
all
whales
so
call
him
the
hyena
whale
if
you
please
his
voracity
is
well
known
and
from
the
circumstance
that
the
inner
angles
of
his
lips
are
curved
upwards
he
carries
an
everlasting
mephistophelean
grin
on
his
face
this
whale
averages
some
sixteen
or
eighteen
feet
in
length
he
is
found
in
almost
all
latitudes
he
has
a
peculiar
way
of
showing
his
dorsal
hooked
fin
in
swimming
which
looks
something
like
a
roman
nose
when
not
more
profitably
employed
the
sperm
whale
hunters
sometimes
capture
the
hyena
whale
to
keep
up
the
supply
of
cheap
oil
for
domestic
employment—as
some
frugal
housekeepers
in
the
absence
of
company
and
quite
alone
by
themselves
burn
unsavory
tallow
instead
of
odorous
wax
though
their
blubber
is
very
thin

of
these
whales
will
yield
you
upwards
of
thirty
gallons
of

_narwhale_
that
is
_nostril
whale_.—another
instance
of
a
curiously
named
whale
so
named
i
suppose
from
his
peculiar
horn
being
originally
mistaken
for
a
peaked
nose
the
creature
is
some
sixteen
feet
in
length
while
its
horn
averages
five
feet
though
some
exceed
ten
and
even
attain
to
fifteen
feet
strictly
speaking
this
horn
is
but
a
lengthened
tusk
growing
out
from
the
jaw
in
a
line
a
little
depressed
from
the
horizontal
but
it
is
only
found
on
the
sinister
side
which
has
an
ill
effect
giving
its
owner
something
analogous
to
the
aspect
of
a
clumsy
left-handed
man
what
precise
purpose
this
ivory
horn
or
lance
answers
it
would
be
hard
to
say
it
does
not
seem
to
be
used
like
the
blade
of
the
sword-fish
and
bill-fish
though
some
sailors
tell
me
that
the
narwhale
employs
it
for
a
rake
in
turning
over
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
food
charley
coffin
said
it
was
used
for
an
ice-piercer
for
the
narwhale
rising
to
the
surface
of
the
polar
sea
and
finding
it
sheeted
with
ice
thrusts
his
horn
up
and
so
breaks
through
but
you
cannot
prove
either
of
these
surmises
to
be
correct
my
own
opinion
is
that
however
this
one-sided
horn
may
really
be
used
by
the
narwhale—however
that
may
be—it
would
certainly
be
very
convenient
to
him
for
a
folder
in
reading
pamphlets
the
narwhale
i
have
heard
called
the
tusked
whale
the
horned
whale
and
the
unicorn
whale
he
is
certainly
a
curious
example
of
the
unicornism
to
be
found
in
almost
every
kingdom
of
animated
nature
from
certain
cloistered
old
authors
i
have
gathered
that
this
same
sea-unicorn’s
horn
was
in
ancient
days
regarded
as
the
great
antidote
against
poison
and
as
such
preparations
of
it
brought
immense
prices
it
was
also
distilled
to
a
volatile
salts
for
fainting
ladies
the
same
way
that
the
horns
of
the
male
deer
are
manufactured
into
hartshorn
originally
it
was
in
itself
accounted
an
object
of
great
curiosity

letter
tells
me
that
sir
martin

for

period
after
hung
in

castle
at

an

avers
that

did
likewise
present

another
horn

a
very
picturesque
leopard-like
look

a
milk-white
ground
colour
dotted

_killer_).—of
this
whale
little
is
precisely
known
to
the
nantucketer
and
nothing
at
all
to
the
professed
naturalist
from
what
i
have
seen
of
him
at
a
distance
i
should
say
that
he
was
about
the
bigness
of
a
grampus
he
is
very
savage—a
sort
of
feegee
fish
he
sometimes
takes
the
great
folio
whales
by
the
lip
and
hangs
there
like
a
leech
till
the
mighty
brute
is
worried

death
the
killer
is
never
hunted
i
never
heard
what
sort
of
oil
he
has
exception
might
be
taken
to
the
name
bestowed
upon
this

for
a
ferule
in
thrashing
his
foes
he
mounts
the
folio
whale’s
back
and
as
he
swims
he
works
his
passage
by
flogging
him
as
some
schoolmasters
get
along
in
the
world
by
a
similar
process
still
less
is
known
of
the
thrasher

of

to

it
may
possibly
seem
strange
that
fishes
not

exceeding
four

five
feet

be
marshalled
among

word
which
in
the

sense
always
conveys
an
idea
of
hugeness

the
creatures
set
down

infallibly
whales

the
terms

_huzza
porpoise_).—this
is
the
common
porpoise

almost
all
over

globe
the
name
is
of
my
own
bestowal
for
there
are
more
than
one
sort
of
porpoises
and
something
must
be
done
to
distinguish
them
i
call
him
thus
because
he
always
swims
in
hilarious
shoals
which
upon
the
broad
sea
keep
tossing
themselves
to
heaven
like
caps
in
a
fourth-of-july
crowd
their
appearance
is
generally
hailed
with
delight
by

spirits

they
are

before
the
wind
they
are
accounted
a
lucky
omen

you
yourself
can
withstand
three
cheers

beholding
these
vivacious
fish

heaven
help
ye
the
spirit

godly
gamesomeness
is
not

yield
you
one
good
gallon
of
good

but
the
fine
and
delicate
fluid
extracted
from
his
jaws
is
exceedingly
valuable
it
is
in
request
among
jewellers

sailors
put
it

meat

porpoise
being
of
a
less
rotund
and
jolly
girth
indeed
he
is
of
quite
a
neat
and
gentleman-like
figure
he
has
no
fins
on
his
back
most
other
porpoises
have
he
has
a
lovely
tail
and
sentimental
indian
eyes
of
a
hazel
hue
but
his
mealy-mouth
spoils
all
though
his
entire
back
down
to
his
side
fins
is
of
a
deep
sable
yet
a
boundary
line
distinct
as
the
mark
in
a
ship’s
hull
called
the
“bright
waist,”
that
line
streaks
him
from
stem
to
stern
with
two
separate
colours
black
above
and
white
below
the
white
comprises
part
of
his
head
and
the
whole
of
his
mouth
which
makes
him
look
as
if
he
had
just
escaped
from
a
felonious
visit
to
a
meal-bag
a
most
mean
and
mealy
aspect
his
oil
is
much
like
that
of
the
common
porpoise

beyond
the
duodecimo
this
system
does
not
proceed
inasmuch
as
the
porpoise
is
the
smallest
of
the
whales
above
you
have
all
the
leviathans
of
note
but
there
are
a
rabble
of
uncertain
fugitive
half-fabulous
whales
which
as
an
american
whaleman
i
know
by
reputation
but
not
personally
i
shall
enumerate
them
by
their
fore-castle
appellations
for
possibly
such
a
list
may
be
valuable
to
future
investigators
who
may
complete
what
i
have
here
but
begun
if
any
of
the
following
whales
shall
hereafter
be
caught
and
marked
then
he
can
readily
be
incorporated
into
this
system
according
to
his
folio
octavo
or
duodecimo
magnitude:—the
bottle-nose
whale
the
junk
whale
the
pudding-headed
whale
the
cape
whale
the
leading
whale
the
cannon
whale
the
scragg
whale
the
coppered
whale
the
elephant
whale
the
iceberg
whale
the
quog
whale
the
blue
whale
etc
from
icelandic
dutch
and
old
english
authorities
there
might
be
quoted
other
lists
of
uncertain
whales
blessed
with
all
manner
of
uncouth
names
but
i
omit
them
as
altogether
obsolete
and
can
hardly
help
suspecting
them
for
mere
sounds
full
of
leviathanism
but
signifying
nothing
finally
it
was
stated
at
the
outset
that
this
system
would
not
be
here
and
at
once
perfected
you
cannot
but
plainly
see
that
i
have
kept
my
word
but
i
now
leave
my
cetological
system
standing
thus
unfinished
even
as
the
great
cathedral
of
cologne
was
left
with
the
crane
still
standing
upon
the
top
of
the
uncompleted
tower
for

erections

the
specksnyder
concerning
the
officers
of
the
whale-craft
this
seems
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
set
down
a
little
domestic
peculiarity
on
ship-board
arising
from
the
existence
of
the
harpooneer
class
of
officers
a
class
unknown
of
course
in
any
other
marine
than
the
whale-fleet
the
large
importance
attached
to
the
harpooneer’s
vocation
is
evinced
by
the
fact
that
originally
in
the
old
dutch
fishery
two
centuries
and
more
ago
the
command
of
a
whale
ship
was
not
wholly
lodged
in
the
person
now
called
the
captain
but
was
divided
between
him
and
an
officer
called
the
specksnyder
literally
this
word
means
fat-cutter
usage
however
in
time
made
it
equivalent
to
chief
harpooneer
in
those
days
the
captain’s
authority
was
restricted
to
the
navigation
and
general
management
of
the
vessel
while
over
the
whale-hunting
department
and
all
its
concerns
the
specksnyder
or
chief
harpooneer
reigned
supreme
in
the
british
greenland
fishery
under
the
corrupted
title
of
specksioneer
this
old
dutch
official
is
still
retained
but
his
former
dignity
is
sadly
abridged
at
present
he
ranks
simply
as
senior
harpooneer
and
as
such
is
but
one
of
the
captain’s
more
inferior
subalterns
nevertheless
as
upon
the
good
conduct
of
the
harpooneers
the
success
of
a
whaling
voyage
largely
depends
and
since
in
the
american
fishery
he
is
not
only
an
important
officer
in
the
boat
but
under
certain
circumstances
night
watches
on
a
whaling
ground
the
command
of
the
ship’s
deck
is
also
his
therefore
the
grand
political
maxim
of
the
sea
demands
that
he
should
nominally
live
apart
from
the
men
before
the
mast
and
be
in
some
way
distinguished
as
their
professional
superior
though
always
by
them
familiarly
regarded
as
their
social
equal
now
the
grand
distinction
drawn
between
officer
and
man
at
sea
is
this—the
first
lives
aft
the
last
forward
hence
in
whale-ships
and
merchantmen
alike
the
mates
have
their
quarters
with
the
captain
and
so
too
in
most
of
the
american
whalers
the
harpooneers
are
lodged
in
the
after
part
of
the
ship
that
is
to
say
they
take
their
meals
in
the
captain’s
cabin
and
sleep
in
a
place
indirectly
communicating
with
it
though
the
long
period
of
a
southern
whaling
voyage
by
far
the
longest
of
all
voyages
now
or
ever
made
by
man
the
peculiar
perils
of
it
and
the
community
of
interest
prevailing
among
a
company
all
of
whom
high
or
low
depend
for
their
profits
not
upon
fixed
wages
but
upon
their
common
luck
together
with
their
common
vigilance
intrepidity
and
hard
work
though
all
these
things
do
in
some
cases
tend
to
beget
a
less
rigorous
discipline
than
in
merchantmen
generally
yet
never
mind
how
much
like
an
old
mesopotamian
family
these
whalemen
may
in
some
primitive
instances
live
together
for
all
that
the
punctilious
externals
at
least
of
the
quarter-deck
are
seldom
materially
relaxed
and
in
no
instance
done
away
indeed
many
are
the
nantucket
ships
in
which
you
will
see
the
skipper
parading
his
quarter-deck
with
an
elated
grandeur
not
surpassed
in
any
military
navy
nay
extorting
almost
as
much
outward
homage
as
if
he
wore
the
imperial
purple
and
not
the
shabbiest
of
pilot-cloth
and
though
of
all
men
the
moody
captain
of
the
pequod
was
the
least
given
to
that
sort
of
shallowest
assumption
and
though
the
only
homage
he
ever
exacted
was
implicit
instantaneous
obedience
though
he
required
no
man
to
remove
the
shoes
from
his
feet
ere
stepping
upon
the
quarter-deck
and
though
there
were
times
when
owing
to
peculiar
circumstances
connected
with
events
hereafter
to
be
detailed
he
addressed
them
in
unusual
terms
whether
of
condescension
or
_in
terrorem_
or
otherwise
yet
even
captain
ahab
was
by
no
means
unobservant
of
the
paramount
forms
and
usages
of
the
sea
nor
perhaps
will
it
fail
to
be
eventually
perceived
that
behind
those
forms
and
usages
as
it
were
he
sometimes
masked
himself
incidentally
making
use
of
them
for
other
and
more
private
ends
than
they
were
legitimately
intended
to
subserve
that
certain
sultanism
of
his
brain
which
had
otherwise
in
a
good
degree
remained
unmanifested
through
those
forms
that
same
sultanism
became
incarnate
in
an
irresistible
dictatorship
for
be
a
man’s
intellectual
superiority
what
it
will
it
can
never
assume
the
practical
available
supremacy
over
other
men
without
the
aid
of
some
sort
of
external
arts
and
entrenchments
always
in
themselves
more
or
less
paltry
and
base
this
it
is
that
for
ever
keeps
god’s
true
princes
of
the
empire
from
the
world’s
hustings
and
leaves
the
highest
honors
that
this
air
can
give
to
those
men
who
become
famous
more
through
their
infinite
inferiority
to
the
choice
hidden
handful
of
the
divine
inert
than
through
their
undoubted
superiority
over
the
dead
level
of
the
mass
such
large
virtue
lurks
in
these
small
things
when
extreme
political
superstitions
invest
them
that
in
some
royal
instances
even
to
idiot
imbecility
they
have
imparted
potency
but
when
as
in
the
case
of
nicholas
the
czar
the
ringed
crown
of
geographical
empire
encircles
an
imperial
brain
then
the
plebeian
herds
crouch
abased
before
the
tremendous
centralization
nor
will
the
tragic
dramatist
who
would
depict
mortal
indomitableness
in
its
fullest
sweep
and
direct
swing
ever
forget
a
hint
incidentally
so
important
in
his
art
as
the
one
now
alluded
to
but
ahab
my
captain
still
moves
before
me
in
all
his
nantucket
grimness
and
shagginess
and
in
this
episode
touching
emperors
and
kings
i
must
not
conceal
that
i
have
only
to
do
with
a
poor
old
whale-hunter
like
him
and
therefore
all
outward
majestical
trappings
and
housings
are
denied
me
oh
ahab
what
shall
be
grand
in
thee
it
must
needs
be
plucked
at
from
the
skies
and
dived
for
in
the
deep
and
featured
in
the
unbodied
air
chapter
34
the
cabin-table
it
is
noon
and
dough-boy
the
steward
thrusting
his
pale
loaf-of-bread
face
from
the
cabin-scuttle
announces
dinner
to
his
lord
and
master
who
sitting
in
the
lee
quarter-boat
has
just
been
taking
an
observation
of
the
sun
and
is
now
mutely
reckoning
the
latitude
on
the
smooth
medallion-shaped
tablet
reserved
for
that
daily
purpose
on
the
upper
part
of
his
ivory
leg
from
his
complete
inattention
to
the
tidings
you
would
think
that
moody
ahab
had
not
heard
his
menial
but
presently
catching
hold
of
the
mizen
shrouds
he
swings
himself
to
the
deck
and
in
an
even
unexhilarated
voice
saying
“dinner
mr
starbuck,”
disappears
into
the
cabin
when
the
last
echo
of
his
sultan’s
step
has
died
away
and
starbuck
the
first
emir
has
every
reason
to
suppose
that
he
is
seated
then
starbuck
rouses
from
his
quietude
takes
a
few
turns
along
the
planks
and
after
a
grave
peep
into
the
binnacle
says
with
some
touch
of
pleasantness
“dinner
mr
stubb,”
and
descends
the
scuttle
the
second
emir
lounges
about
the
rigging
awhile
and
then
slightly
shaking
the
main
brace
to
see
whether
it
will
be
all
right
with
that
important
rope
he
likewise
takes
up
the
old
burden
and
with
a
rapid
“dinner
mr
flask,”
follows
after
his
predecessors
but
the
third
emir
now
seeing
himself
all
alone
on
the
quarter-deck
seems
to
feel
relieved
from
some
curious
restraint
for
tipping
all
sorts
of
knowing
winks
in
all
sorts
of
directions
and
kicking
off
his
shoes
he
strikes
into
a
sharp
but
noiseless
squall
of
a
hornpipe
right
over
the
grand
turk’s
head
and
then
by
a
dexterous
sleight
pitching
his
cap
up
into
the
mizentop
for
a
shelf
he
goes
down
rollicking
so
far
at
least
as
he
remains
visible
from
the
deck
reversing
all
other
processions
by
bringing
up
the
rear
with
music
but
ere
stepping
into
the
cabin
doorway
below
he
pauses
ships
a
new
face
altogether
and
then
independent
hilarious
little
flask
enters
king
ahab’s
presence
in
the
character
of
abjectus
or
the
slave
it
is
not
the
least
among
the
strange
things
bred
by
the
intense
artificialness
of
sea-usages
that
while
in
the
open
air
of
the
deck
some
officers
will
upon
provocation
bear
themselves
boldly
and
defyingly
enough
towards
their
commander
yet
ten
to
one
let
those
very
officers
the
next
moment
go
down
to
their
customary
dinner
in
that
same
commander’s
cabin
and
straightway
their
inoffensive
not
to
say
deprecatory
and
humble
air
towards
him
as
he
sits
at
the
head
of
the
table
this
is
marvellous
sometimes
most
comical
wherefore
this
difference
a
problem
perhaps
not
to
have
been
belshazzar
king
of
babylon
and
to
have
been
belshazzar
not
haughtily
but
courteously
therein
certainly
must
have
been
some
touch
of
mundane
grandeur
but
he
who
in
the
rightly
regal
and
intelligent
spirit
presides
over
his
own
private
dinner-table
of
invited
guests
that
man’s
unchallenged
power
and
dominion
of
individual
influence
for
the
time
that
man’s
royalty
of
state
transcends
belshazzar’s
for
belshazzar
was
not
the
greatest
who
has
but
once
dined
his
friends
has
tasted
what
it
is
to
be
cæsar
it
is
a
witchery
of
social
czarship
which
there
is
no
withstanding
now
if
to
this
consideration
you
superadd
the
official
supremacy
of
a
ship-master
then
by
inference
you
will
derive
the
cause
of
that
peculiarity
of
sea-life
just
mentioned
over
his
ivory-inlaid
table
ahab
presided
like
a
mute
maned
sea-lion
on
the
white
coral
beach
surrounded
by
his
warlike
but
still
deferential
cubs
in
his
own
proper
turn
each
officer
waited
to
be
served
they
were
as
little
children
before
ahab
and
yet
in
ahab
there
seemed
not
to
lurk
the
smallest
social
arrogance
with
one
mind
their
intent
eyes
all
fastened
upon
the
old
man’s
knife
as
he
carved
the
chief
dish
before
him
i
do
not
suppose
that
for
the
world
they
would
have
profaned
that
moment
with
the
slightest
observation
even
upon
so
neutral
a
topic
as
the
weather
no
and
when
reaching
out
his
knife
and
fork
between
which
the
slice
of
beef
was
locked
ahab
thereby
motioned
starbuck’s
plate
towards
him
the
mate
received
his
meat
as
though
receiving
alms
and
cut
it
tenderly
and
a
little
started
if
perchance
the
knife
grazed
against
the
plate
and
chewed
it
noiselessly
and
swallowed
it
not
without
circumspection
for
like
the
coronation
banquet
at
frankfort
where
the
german
emperor
profoundly
dines
with
the
seven
imperial
electors
so
these
cabin
meals
were
somehow
solemn
meals
eaten
in
awful
silence
and
yet
at
table
old
ahab
forbade
not
conversation
only
he
himself
was
dumb
what
a
relief
it
was
to
choking
stubb
when
a
rat
made
a
sudden
racket
in
the
hold
below
and
poor
little
flask
he
was
the
youngest
son
and
little
boy
of
this
weary
family
party
his
were
the
shinbones
of
the
saline
beef
his
would
have
been
the
drumsticks
for
flask
to
have
presumed
to
help
himself
this
must
have
seemed
to
him
tantamount
to
larceny
in
the
first
degree
had
he
helped
himself
at
that
table
doubtless
never
more
would
he
have
been
able
to
hold
his
head
up
in
this
honest
world
nevertheless
strange
to
say
ahab
never
forbade
him
and
had
flask
helped
himself
the
chances
were
ahab
had
never
so
much
as
noticed
it
least
of
all
did
flask
presume
to
help
himself
to
butter
whether
he
thought
the
owners
of
the
ship
denied
it
to
him
on
account
of
its
clotting
his
clear
sunny
complexion
or
whether
he
deemed
that
on
so
long
a
voyage
in
such
marketless
waters
butter
was
at
a
premium
and
therefore
was
not
for
him
a
subaltern
however
it
was
flask
alas
was
a
butterless
man
another
thing
flask
was
the
last
person
down
at
the
dinner
and
flask
is
the
first
man
up
consider
for
hereby
flask’s
dinner
was
badly
jammed
in
point
of
time
starbuck
and
stubb
both
had
the
start
of
him
and
yet
they
also
have
the
privilege
of
lounging
in
the
rear
if
stubb
even
who
is
but
a
peg
higher
than
flask
happens
to
have
but
a
small
appetite
and
soon
shows
symptoms
of
concluding
his
repast
then
flask
must
bestir
himself
he
will
not
get
more
than
three
mouthfuls
that
day
for
it
is
against
holy
usage
for
stubb
to
precede
flask
to
the
deck
therefore
it
was
that
flask
once
admitted
in
private
that
ever
since
he
had
arisen
to
the
dignity
of
an
officer
from
that
moment
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
otherwise
than
hungry
more
or
less
for
what
he
ate
did
not
so
much
relieve
his
hunger
as
keep
it
immortal
in
him
peace
and
satisfaction
thought
flask
have
for
ever
departed
from
my
stomach
i
am
an
officer
but
how
i
wish
i
could
fish
a
bit
of
old-fashioned
beef
in
the
forecastle
as
i
used
to
when
i
was
before
the
mast
there’s
the
fruits
of
promotion
now
there’s
the
vanity
of
glory
there’s
the
insanity
of
life
besides
if
it
were
so
that
any
mere
sailor
of
the
pequod
had
a
grudge
against
flask
in
flask’s
official
capacity
all
that
sailor
had
to
do
in

ample
vengeance
was
to
go
aft
at
dinner-time
and
get
a
peep
at
flask
through
the
cabin
sky-light
sitting
silly
and
dumfoundered
before
awful
ahab
now
ahab
and
his
three
mates
formed
what
may
be
called
the
first
table
in
the
pequod’s
cabin
after
their
departure
taking
place
in
inverted
order
to
their
arrival
the
canvas
cloth
was
cleared
or
rather
was
restored
to
some
hurried
order
by
the
pallid
steward
and
then
the
three
harpooneers
were
bidden
to
the
feast
they
being
its
residuary
legatees
they
made
a
sort
of
temporary
servants’
hall
of
the
high
and
mighty
cabin
in
strange
contrast
to
the
hardly
tolerable
constraint
and
nameless
invisible
domineerings
of
the
captain’s
table
was
the
entire
care-free
license
and
ease
the
almost
frantic
democracy
of
those
inferior
fellows
the
harpooneers
while
their
masters
the
mates
seemed
afraid
of
the
sound
of
the
hinges
of
their
own
jaws
the
harpooneers
chewed
their
food
with
such
a
relish
that
there
was
a
report
to
it
they
dined
like
lords
they
filled
their
bellies
like
indian
ships
all
day
loading
with
spices
such
portentous
appetites
had
queequeg
and
tashtego
that
to
fill
out
the
vacancies
made
by
the
previous
repast
often
the
pale
dough-boy
was
fain
to
bring
on
a
great
baron
of
salt-junk
seemingly
quarried
out
of
the
solid
ox
and
if
he
were
not
lively
about
it
if
he
did
not
go
with
a
nimble
hop-skip-and-jump
then
tashtego
had
an
ungentlemanly
way
of
accelerating
him
by
darting
a
fork
at
his
back
harpoon-wise
and
once
daggoo
seized
with
a
sudden
humor
assisted
dough-boy’s
memory
by
snatching
him
up
bodily
and
thrusting
his
head
into
a
great
empty
wooden
trencher
while
tashtego
knife
in
hand
began
laying
out
the
circle
preliminary
to
scalping
him
he
was
naturally
a
very
nervous
shuddering
sort
of
little
fellow
this
bread-faced
steward
the
progeny
of
a
bankrupt
baker
and
a
hospital
nurse
and
what
with
the
standing
spectacle
of
the
black
terrific
ahab
and
the
periodical
tumultuous
visitations
of
these
three
savages
dough-boy’s
whole
life
was
one
continual
lip-quiver
commonly
after
seeing
the
harpooneers
furnished
with
all
things
they
demanded
he
would
escape
from
their
clutches
into
his
little
pantry
adjoining
and
fearfully
peep
out
at
them
through
the
blinds
of
its
door
till
all
was
over
it
was
a
sight
to
see
queequeg
seated
over
against
tashtego
opposing
his
filed
teeth
to
the
indian’s
crosswise
to
them
daggoo
seated
on
the
floor
for
a
bench
would
have
brought
his
hearse-plumed
head
to
the
low
carlines
at
every
motion
of
his
colossal
limbs
making
the
low
cabin
framework
to
shake
as
when
an
african
elephant
goes
passenger
in
a
ship
but
for
all
this
the
great
negro
was
wonderfully
abstemious
not
to
say
dainty
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
by
such
comparatively
small
mouthfuls
he
could
keep
up
the
vitality
diffused
through
so
broad
baronial
and
superb
a
person
but
doubtless
this
noble
savage
fed
strong
and
drank
deep
of
the
abounding
element
of
air
and
through
his
dilated
nostrils
snuffed
in
the
sublime
life
of
the
worlds
not
by
beef
or
by
bread
are
giants
made
or
nourished
but
queequeg
he
had
a
mortal
barbaric
smack
of
the
lip
in
eating—an
ugly
sound
enough—so
much
so
that
the
trembling
dough-boy
almost
looked
to
see
whether
any
marks
of
teeth
lurked
in
his
own
lean
arms
and
when
he
would
hear
tashtego
singing
out
for
him
to
produce
himself
that
his
bones
might
be
picked
the
simple-witted
steward
all
but
shattered
the
crockery
hanging
round
him
in
the
pantry
by
his
sudden
fits
of
the
palsy
nor
did
the
whetstone
which
the
harpooneers
carried
in
their
pockets
for
their
lances
and
other
weapons
and
with
which
whetstones
at
dinner
they
would
ostentatiously
sharpen
their
knives
that
grating
sound
did
not
at
all
tend
to
tranquillize
poor
dough-boy
how
could
he
forget
that
in
his
island
days
queequeg
for
one
must
certainly
have
been
guilty
of
some
murderous
convivial
indiscretions
alas
dough-boy
hard
fares
the
white
waiter
who
waits
upon
cannibals
not
a
napkin
should
he
carry
on
his
arm
but
a
buckler
in
good
time
though
to
his
great
delight
the
three
salt-sea
warriors
would
rise
and
depart
to
his
credulous
fable-mongering
ears
all
their
martial
bones
jingling
in
them
at
every
step
like
moorish
scimetars
in
scabbards
but
though
these
barbarians
dined
in
the
cabin
and
nominally
lived
there
still
being
anything
but
sedentary
in
their
habits
they
were
scarcely
ever
in
it
except
at
mealtimes
and
just
before
sleeping-time
when
they
passed
through
it
to
their
own
peculiar
quarters
in
this
one
matter
ahab
seemed
no
exception
to
most
american
whale
captains
who
as
a
set
rather
incline
to
the
opinion
that
by
rights
the
ship’s
cabin
belongs
to
them
and
that
it
is
by
courtesy
alone
that
anybody
else
is
at
any
time
permitted
there
so
that
in
real
truth
the
mates
and
harpooneers
of
the
pequod
might
more
properly
be
said
to
have
lived
out
of
the
cabin
than
in
it
for
when
they
did
enter
it
it
was
something
as
a
street-door
enters
a
house
turning
inwards
for
a
moment
only
to
be
turned
out
the
next
and
as
a
permanent
thing
residing
in
the
open
air
nor
did
they
lose
much
hereby
in
the
cabin
was
no
companionship
socially
ahab
was
inaccessible
though
nominally
included
in
the
census
of
christendom
he
was
still
an
alien
to
it
he
lived
in
the
world
as
the
last
of
the
grisly
bears
lived
in
settled
missouri
and
as
when
spring
and
summer
had
departed
that
wild
logan
of
the
woods
burying
himself
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
lived
out
the
winter
there
sucking
his
own
paws
so
in
his
inclement
howling
old
age
ahab’s
soul
shut
up
in
the
caved
trunk
of
his
body
there
fed
upon
the
sullen
paws
of
its
gloom

the
mast-head
it
was
during
the
more
pleasant
weather
that
in
due
rotation
with
the
other
seamen
my
first
mast-head
came
round
in
most
american
whalemen
the
mast-heads
are
manned
almost
simultaneously
with
the
vessel’s
leaving
her
port
even
though
she
may
have
fifteen
thousand
miles
and
more
to
sail
ere
reaching
her
proper
cruising
ground
and
if
after
a
three
four
or
five
years’
voyage
she
is
drawing
nigh
home
with
anything
empty
in
her—say
an
empty
vial
even—then
her
mast-heads
are
kept
manned
to
the
last
and
not
till
her
skysail-poles
sail
in
among
the
spires
of
the
port
does
she
altogether
relinquish
the
hope
of
capturing
one
whale
more
now
as
the
business
of
standing
mast-heads
ashore
or
afloat
is
a
very
ancient
and
interesting
one
let
us
in
some
measure
expatiate
here
i
take
it
that
the
earliest
standers
of
mast-heads
were
the
old
egyptians
because
in
all
my
researches
i
find
none
prior
to
them
for
though
their
progenitors
the
builders
of
babel
must
doubtless
by
their
tower
have
intended
to
rear
the
loftiest
mast-head
in
all
asia
or
africa
either
yet
ere
the
final
truck
was
put
to
it
as
that
great
stone
mast
of
theirs
may
be
said
to
have
gone
by
the
board
in
the
dread
gale
of
god’s
wrath
therefore
we
cannot
give
these
babel
builders
priority
over
the
egyptians
and
that
the
egyptians
were
a
nation
of
mast-head
standers
is
an
assertion
based
upon
the
general
belief
among
archæologists
that
the
first
pyramids
were
founded
for
astronomical
purposes
a
theory
singularly
supported
by
the
peculiar
stair-like
formation
of
all
four
sides
of
those
edifices
whereby
with
prodigious
long
upliftings
of
their
legs
those
old
astronomers
were
wont
to
mount
to
the
apex
and
sing
out
for
new
stars
even
as
the
look-outs
of
a
modern
ship
sing
out
for
a
sail
or
a
whale
just
bearing
in
sight
in
saint
stylites
the
famous
christian
hermit
of
old
times
who
built
him
a
lofty
stone
pillar
in
the
desert
and
spent
the
whole
latter
portion
of
his
life
on
its
summit
hoisting
his
food
from
the
ground
with
a
tackle
in
him
we
have
a
remarkable
instance
of
a
dauntless
stander-of-mast-heads
who
was
not
to
be
driven
from
his
place
by
fogs
or
frosts
rain
hail
or
sleet
but
valiantly
facing
everything
out
to
the
last
literally
died
at
his
post
of
modern
standers-of-mast-heads
we
have
but
a
lifeless
set
mere
stone
iron
and
bronze
men
who
though
well
capable
of
facing
out
a
stiff
gale
are
still
entirely
incompetent
to
the
business
of
singing
out
upon
discovering
any
strange
sight
there
is
napoleon
who
upon
the
top
of
the
column
of
vendome
stands
with
arms
folded
some
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
the
air
careless
now
who
rules
the
decks
below
whether
louis
philippe
louis
blanc
or
louis
the
devil
great
washington
too
stands
high
aloft
on
his
towering
main-mast
in
baltimore
and
like
one
of
hercules’
pillars
his
column
marks
that
point
of
human
grandeur
beyond
which
few
mortals
will
go
admiral
nelson
also
on
a
capstan
of
gun-metal
stands
his
mast-head
in
trafalgar
square
and
ever
when
most
obscured
by
that
london
smoke
token
is
yet
given
that
a
hidden
hero
is
there
for
where
there
is
smoke
must
be
fire
but
neither
great
washington
nor
napoleon
nor
nelson
will
answer
a
single
hail
from
below
however
madly
invoked
to
befriend
by
their
counsels
the
distracted
decks
upon
which
they
gaze
however
it
may
be
surmised
that
their
spirits
penetrate
through
the
thick
haze
of
the
future
and
descry
what
shoals
and
what
rocks
must
be
shunned
it
may
seem
unwarrantable
to
couple
in
any
respect
the
mast-head
standers
of
the
land
with
those
of
the
sea
but
that
in
truth
it
is
not
so
is
plainly
evinced
by
an
item
for
which
obed
macy
the
sole
historian
of
nantucket
stands
accountable
the
worthy
obed
tells
us
that
in
the
early
times
of
the
whale
fishery
ere
ships
were
regularly
launched
in
pursuit
of
the
game
the
people
of
that
island
erected
lofty
spars
along
the
sea-coast
to
which
the
look-outs
ascended
by
means
of
nailed
cleats
something
as
fowls
go
upstairs
in
a
hen-house
a
few
years
ago
this
same
plan
was
adopted
by
the
bay
whalemen
of
new
zealand
who
upon
descrying
the
game
gave
notice
to
the
ready-manned
boats
nigh
the
beach
but
this
custom
has
now
become
obsolete
turn
we
then
to
the
one
proper
mast-head
that
of
a
whale-ship
at
sea
the
three
mast-heads
are
kept
manned
from
sun-rise
to
sun-set
the
seamen
taking
their
regular
turns
as
at
the
helm
and
relieving
each
other
every
two
hours
in
the
serene
weather
of
the
tropics
it
is
exceedingly
pleasant
the
mast-head
nay
to
a
dreamy
meditative
man
it
is
delightful
there
you
stand
a
hundred
feet
above
the
silent
decks
striding
along
the
deep
as
if
the
masts
were
gigantic
stilts
while
beneath
you
and
between
your
legs
as
it
were
swim
the
hugest
monsters
of
the
sea
even
as
ships
once
sailed
between
the
boots
of
the
famous
colossus
at
old
rhodes
there
you
stand
lost
in
the
infinite
series
of
the
sea
with
nothing
ruffled
but
the
waves
the
tranced
ship
indolently
rolls
the
drowsy
trade
winds
blow
everything
resolves
you
into
languor
for
the
most
part
in
this
tropic
whaling
life
a
sublime
uneventfulness
invests
you
you
hear
no
news
read
no
gazettes
extras
with
startling
accounts
of
commonplaces
never
delude
you
into
unnecessary
excitements
you
hear
of
no
domestic
afflictions
bankrupt
securities
fall
of
stocks
are
never
troubled
with
the
thought
of
what
you
shall
have
for
dinner—for
all
your
meals
for
three
years
and
more
are
snugly
stowed
in
casks
and
your
bill
of
fare
is
immutable
in
one
of
those
southern
whalesmen
on
a
long
three
or
four
years’
voyage
as
often
happens
the
sum
of
the
various
hours
you
spend
at
the
mast-head
would
amount
to
several
entire
months
and
it
is
much
to
be
deplored
that
the
place
to
which
you
devote
so
considerable
a
portion
of
the
whole
term
of
your
natural
life
should
be
so
sadly
destitute
of
anything
approaching
to
a
cosy
inhabitiveness
or
adapted
to
breed
a
comfortable
localness
of
feeling
such
as
pertains
to
a
bed
a
hammock
a
hearse
a
sentry
box
a
pulpit
a
coach
or
any
other
of
those
small
and
snug
contrivances
in
which
men
temporarily
isolate
themselves
your
most
usual
point
of
perch
is
the
head
of
the
t’
gallant-mast
where
you
stand
upon
two
thin
parallel
sticks
almost
peculiar
to
whalemen
called
the
t’
gallant
cross-trees
here
tossed
about
by
the
sea
the
beginner
feels
about
as
cosy
as
he
would
standing
on
a
bull’s
horns
to
be
sure
in
cold
weather
you
may
carry
your
house
aloft
with
you
in
the
shape
of
a
watch-coat
but
properly
speaking
the
thickest
watch-coat
is
no
more
of
a
house
than
the
unclad
body
for
as
the
soul
is
glued
inside
of
its
fleshy
tabernacle
and
cannot
freely
move
about
in
it
nor
even
move
out
of
it
without
running
great
risk
of
perishing
like
an
ignorant
pilgrim
crossing
the
snowy
alps
in
winter
so
a
watch-coat
is
not
so
much
of
a
house
as
it
is
a
mere
envelope
or
additional
skin
encasing
you
you
cannot
put
a
shelf
or
chest
of
drawers
in
your
body
and
no
more
can
you
make
a
convenient
closet
of
your
watch-coat
concerning
all
this
it
is
much
to
be
deplored
that
the
mast-heads
of
a
southern
whale
ship
are
unprovided
with
those
enviable
little
tents
or
pulpits
called
_crow’s-nests_
in
which
the
look-outs
of
a
greenland
whaler
are
protected
from
the
inclement
weather
of
the
frozen
seas
in
the
fireside
narrative
of
captain
sleet
entitled
“a
voyage
among
the
icebergs
in
quest
of
the
greenland
whale
and
incidentally
for
the
re-discovery
of
the
lost
icelandic
colonies
of
old
greenland;”
in
this
admirable
volume
all
standers
of
mast-heads
are
furnished
with
a
charmingly
circumstantial
account
of
the
then
recently
invented
_crow’s-nest_
of
the
glacier
which
was
the
name
of
captain
sleet’s
good
craft
he
called
it
the
_sleet’s
crow’s-nest_
in
honor
of
himself
he
being
the
original
inventor
and
patentee
and
free
from
all
ridiculous
false
delicacy
and
holding
that
if
we
call
our
own
children
after
our
own
names
we
fathers
being
the
original
inventors
and
patentees
so
likewise
should
we
denominate
after
ourselves
any
other
apparatus
we
may
beget
in
shape
the
sleet’s
crow’s-nest
is
something
like
a
large
tierce
or
pipe
it
is
open
above
however
where
it
is
furnished
with
a
movable
side-screen
to
keep
to
windward
of
your
head
in
a
hard
gale
being
fixed
on
the
summit
of
the
mast
you
ascend
into
it
through
a
little
trap-hatch
in
the
bottom
on
the
after
side
or
side
next
the
stern
of
the
ship
is
a
comfortable
seat
with
a
locker
underneath
for
umbrellas
comforters
and
coats
in
front
is
a
leather
rack
in
which
to
keep
your
speaking
trumpet
pipe
telescope
and
other
nautical
conveniences
when
captain
sleet
in
person
stood
his
mast-head
in
this
crow’s-nest
of
his
he
tells
us
that
he
always
had
a
rifle
with
him
also
fixed
in
the
rack
together
with
a
powder
flask
and
shot
for
the
purpose
of
popping
off
the
stray
narwhales
or
vagrant
sea
unicorns
infesting
those
waters
for
you
cannot
successfully
shoot
at
them
from
the
deck
owing
to
the
resistance
of
the
water
but
to
shoot
down
upon
them
is
a
very
different
thing
now
it
was
plainly
a
labor
of
love
for
captain
sleet
to
describe
as
he
does
all
the
little
detailed
conveniences
of
his
crow’s-nest
but
though
he
so
enlarges
upon
many
of
these
and
though
he
treats
us
to
a
very
scientific
account
of
his
experiments
in
this
crow’s-nest
with
a
small
compass
he
kept
there
for
the
purpose
of
counteracting
the
errors
resulting
from
what
is
called
the
“local
attraction”
of
all
binnacle
magnets
an
error
ascribable
to
the
horizontal
vicinity
of
the
iron
in
the
ship’s
planks
and
in
the
glacier’s
case
perhaps
to
there
having
been
so
many
broken-down
blacksmiths
among
her
crew
i
say
that
though
the
captain
is
very
discreet
and
scientific
here
yet
for
all
his
learned
“binnacle
deviations,”
“azimuth
compass
observations,”
and
“approximate
errors,”
he
knows
very
well
captain
sleet
that
he
was
not
so
much
immersed
in
those
profound
magnetic
meditations
as
to
fail
being
attracted
occasionally
towards
that
well
replenished
little
case-bottle
so
nicely
tucked
in
on
one
side
of
his
crow’s
nest
within
easy
reach
of
his
hand
though
upon
the
whole
i
greatly
admire
and
even
love
the
brave
the
honest
and
learned
captain
yet
i
take
it
very
ill
of
him
that
he
should
so
utterly
ignore
that
case-bottle
seeing
what
a
faithful
friend
and
comforter
it
must
have
been
while
with
mittened
fingers
and
hooded
head
he
was
studying
the
mathematics
aloft
there
in
that
bird’s
nest
within
three
or
four
perches
of
the
pole
but
if
we
southern
whale-fishers
are
not
so
snugly
housed
aloft
as
captain
sleet
and
his
greenlandmen
were
yet
that
disadvantage
is
greatly
counter-balanced
by
the
widely
contrasting
serenity
of
those
seductive
seas
in
which
we
south
fishers
mostly
float
for
one
i
used
to
lounge
up
the
rigging
very
leisurely
resting
in
the
top
to
have
a
chat
with
queequeg
or
any
one
else
off
duty
whom
i
might
find
there
then
ascending
a
little
way
further
and
throwing
a
lazy
leg
over
the
top-sail
yard
take
a
preliminary
view
of
the
watery
pastures
and
so
at
last
mount
to
my
ultimate
destination
let
me
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
here
and
frankly
admit
that
i
kept
but
sorry
guard
with
the
problem
of
the
universe
revolving
in
me
how
could
i—being
left
completely
to
myself
at
such
a
thought-engendering
altitude—how
could
i
but
lightly
hold
my
obligations
to
observe
all
whale-ships’
standing
orders
“keep
your
weather
eye
open
and
sing
out
every
time.”
and
let
me
in
this
place
movingly
admonish
you
ye
ship-owners
of
nantucket
beware
of
enlisting
in
your
vigilant
fisheries
any
lad
with
lean
brow
and
hollow
eye
given
to
unseasonable
meditativeness
and
who
offers
to
ship
with
the
phædon
instead
of
bowditch
in
his
head
beware
of
such
an
one
i
say
your
whales
must
be
seen
before
they
can
be
killed
and
this
sunken-eyed
young
platonist
will
tow
you
ten
wakes
round
the
world
and
never
make
you
one
pint
of
sperm
the
richer
nor
are
these
monitions
at
all
unneeded
for
nowadays
the
whale-fishery
furnishes
an
asylum
for
many
romantic
melancholy
and
absent-minded
young
men
disgusted
with
the
carking
cares
of
earth
and
seeking
sentiment
in
tar
and
blubber
childe
harold
not
unfrequently
perches
himself
upon
the
mast-head
of
some
luckless
disappointed
whale-ship
and
in
moody
phrase
ejaculates:—
“roll
on
thou
deep
and
dark
blue
ocean
roll
ten
thousand
blubber-hunters
sweep
over
thee
in
vain.”
very
often
do
the
captains
of
such
ships
take
those
absent-minded
young
philosophers
to
task
upbraiding
them
with
not
feeling
sufficient
“interest”
in
the
voyage
half-hinting
that
they
are
so
hopelessly
lost
to
all
honorable
ambition
as
that
in
their
secret
souls
they
would
rather
not
see
whales
than
otherwise
but
all
in
vain
those
young
platonists
have
a
notion
that
their
vision
is
imperfect
they
are
short-sighted
what
use
then
to
strain
the
visual
nerve
they
have
left
their
opera-glasses
at
home
“why
thou
monkey,”
said
a
harpooneer
to
one
of
these
lads
“we’ve
been
cruising
now
hard
upon
three
years
and
thou
hast
not
raised
a
whale
yet
whales
are
scarce
as
hen’s
teeth
whenever
thou
art
up
here.”
perhaps
they
were
or
perhaps
there
might
have
been
shoals
of
them
in
the
far
horizon
but
lulled
into
such
an
opium-like
listlessness
of
vacant
unconscious
reverie
is
this
absent-minded
youth
by
the
blending
cadence
of
waves
with
thoughts
that
at
last
he
loses
his
identity
takes
the
mystic
ocean
at
his
feet
for
the
visible
image
of
that
deep
blue
bottomless
soul
pervading
mankind
and
nature
and
every
strange
half-seen
gliding
beautiful
thing
that
eludes
him
every
dimly-discovered
uprising
fin
of
some
undiscernible
form
seems
to
him
the
embodiment
of
those
elusive
thoughts
that
only
people
the
soul
by
continually
flitting
through
it
in
this
enchanted
mood
thy
spirit
ebbs
away
to
whence
it
came
becomes
diffused
through
time
and
space
like
cranmer’s
sprinkled
pantheistic
ashes
forming
at

a
part
of
every
shore
the
round

that
rocking
life

by
a

rolling

by
her
borrowed

by
the

from
the
inscrutable
tides
of

while
this

this

on
ye

your

an

your

at

the
quarter-deck
_enter
ahab
then
all._
it
was
not
a
great
while
after
the
affair
of
the
pipe
that
one
morning
shortly
after
breakfast
ahab
as
was
his
wont
ascended
the
cabin-gangway
to
the
deck
there
most
sea-captains
usually
walk
at
that
hour
as
country
gentlemen
after
the
same
meal
take
a
few
turns
in
the
garden
soon
his
steady
ivory
stride
was
heard
as
to
and
fro
he
paced
his
old
rounds
upon
planks
so
familiar
to
his
tread
that
they
were
all
over
dented
like
geological
stones
with
the
peculiar
mark
of
his
walk
did
you
fixedly
gaze
too
upon
that
ribbed
and
dented
brow
there
also
you
would
see
still
stranger
foot-prints—the
foot-prints
of
his
one
unsleeping
ever-pacing
thought
but
on
the
occasion
in
question
those
dents
looked
deeper
even
as
his
nervous
step
that
morning
left
a
deeper
mark
and
so
full
of
his
thought
was
ahab
that
at
every
uniform
turn
that
he
made
now
at
the
main-mast
and
now
at
the
binnacle
you
could
almost
see
that
thought
turn
in
him
as
he
turned
and
pace
in
him
as
he
paced
so
completely
possessing
him
indeed
that
it
all
but
seemed
the
inward
mould
of
every
outer
movement
“d’ye
mark
him
flask?”
whispered
stubb
“the
chick
that’s
in
him
pecks
the
shell
’twill
soon
be
out.”
the
hours
wore
on;—ahab
now
shut
up
within
his
cabin
anon
pacing
the
deck
with
the
same
intense
bigotry
of
purpose
in
his
aspect
it
drew
near
the
close
of
day
suddenly
he
came
to
a
halt
by
the
bulwarks
and
inserting
his
bone
leg
into
the
auger-hole
there
and
with
one
hand
grasping
a
shroud
he
ordered
starbuck
to
send
everybody
aft
“sir!”
said
the
mate
astonished
at
an
order
seldom
or
never
given
on
ship-board
except
in
some
extraordinary
case
“send
everybody
aft,”
repeated
ahab
“mast-heads
there
come
down!”
when
the
entire
ship’s
company
were
assembled
and
with
curious
and
not
wholly
unapprehensive
faces
were
eyeing
him
for
he
looked
not
unlike
the
weather
horizon
when
a
storm
is
coming
up
ahab
after
rapidly
glancing
over
the
bulwarks
and
then
darting
his
eyes
among
the
crew
started
from
his
standpoint
and
as
though
not
a
soul
were
nigh
him
resumed
his
heavy
turns
upon
the
deck
with
bent
head
and
half-slouched
hat
he
continued
to
pace
unmindful
of
the
wondering
whispering
among
the
men
till
stubb
cautiously
whispered
to
flask
that
ahab
must
have
summoned
them
there
for
the
purpose
of
witnessing
a
pedestrian
feat
but
this
did
not
last
long
vehemently
pausing
he
cried:—
“what
do
ye
do
when
ye
see
a
whale
men?”
“sing
out
for
him!”
was
the
impulsive
rejoinder
from
a
score
of
clubbed
voices
“good!”
cried
ahab
with
a
wild
approval
in
his
tones
observing
the
hearty
animation
into
which
his
unexpected
question
had
so
magnetically
thrown
them
“and
what
do
ye
next
men?”
“lower
away
and
after
him!”
“and
what
tune
is
it
ye
pull
to
men?”
“a
dead
whale
or
a
stove
boat!”
more
and
more
strangely
and
fiercely
glad
and
approving
grew
the
countenance
of
the
old
man
at
every
shout
while
the
mariners
began
to
gaze
curiously
at
each
other
as
if
marvelling
how
it
was
that
they
themselves
became
so
excited
at
such
seemingly
purposeless
questions
but
they
were
all
eagerness
again
as
ahab
now
half-revolving
in
his
pivot-hole
with
one
hand
reaching
high
up
a
shroud
and
tightly
almost
convulsively
grasping
it
addressed
them
thus:—
“all
ye
mast-headers
have
before
now
heard
me
give
orders
about
a
white
whale
look
ye
d’ye
see
this
spanish
ounce
of
gold?”—holding
up
a
broad
bright
coin
to
the
sun—“it
is
a
sixteen
dollar
piece
men
d’ye
see
it
mr
starbuck
hand
me
yon
top-maul.”
while
the
mate
was
getting
the
hammer
ahab
without
speaking
was
slowly
rubbing
the
gold
piece
against
the
skirts
of
his
jacket
as
if
to
heighten
its
lustre
and
without
using
any
words
was
meanwhile
lowly
humming
to
himself
producing
a
sound
so
strangely
muffled
and
inarticulate
that
it
seemed
the
mechanical
humming
of
the
wheels
of
his
vitality
in
him
receiving
the
top-maul
from
starbuck
he
advanced
towards
the
main-mast
with
the
hammer
uplifted
in
one
hand
exhibiting
the
gold
with
the
other
and
with
a
high
raised
voice
exclaiming
“whosoever
of
ye
raises
me
a
white-headed
whale
with
a
wrinkled
brow
and
a
crooked
jaw
whosoever
of
ye
raises
me
that
white-headed
whale
with
three
holes
punctured
in
his
starboard
fluke—look
ye
whosoever
of
ye
raises
me
that
same
white
whale
he
shall
have
this
gold
ounce
my
boys!”
“huzza
huzza!”
cried
the
seamen
as
with
swinging
tarpaulins
they
hailed
the
act
of
nailing
the
gold
to
the
mast
“it’s
a
white
whale
i
say,”
resumed
ahab
as
he
threw
down
the
topmaul
“a
white
whale
skin
your
eyes
for
him
men
look
sharp
for
white
water
if
ye
see
but
a
bubble
sing
out.”
all
this
while
tashtego
daggoo
and
queequeg
had
looked
on
with
even
more
intense
interest
and
surprise
than
the
rest
and
at
the
mention
of
the
wrinkled
brow
and
crooked
jaw
they
had
started
as
if
each
was
separately
touched
by
some
specific
recollection
“captain
ahab,”
said
tashtego
“that
white
whale
must
be
the
same
that
some
call
moby
dick.”
“moby
dick?”
shouted
ahab
“do
ye
know
the
white
whale
then
tash?”
“does
he
fan-tail
a
little
curious
sir
before
he
goes
down?”
said
the
gay-header
deliberately
“and
has
he
a
curious
spout
too,”
said
daggoo
“very
bushy
even
for
a
parmacetty
and
mighty
quick
captain
ahab?”
“and
he
have
one
two
three—oh
good
many
iron
in
him
hide
too
captain,”
cried
queequeg
disjointedly
“all
twiske-tee
be-twisk
like
him—him—”
faltering
hard
for
a
word
and
screwing
his
hand
round
and
round
as
though
uncorking
a
bottle—“like
him—him—”
“corkscrew!”
cried
ahab
“aye
queequeg
the
harpoons
lie
all
twisted
and
wrenched
in
him
aye
daggoo
his
spout
is
a
big
one
like
a
whole
shock
of
wheat
and
white
as
a
pile
of
our
nantucket
wool
after
the
great
annual
sheep-shearing
aye
tashtego
and
he
fan-tails
like
a
split
jib
in
a
squall
death
and
devils
men
it
is
moby
dick
ye
have
seen—moby
dick—moby
dick!”
“captain
ahab,”
said
starbuck
who
with
stubb
and
flask
had
thus
far
been
eyeing
his
superior
with
increasing
surprise
but
at
last
seemed
struck
with
a
thought
which
somewhat
explained
all
the
wonder
“captain
ahab
i
have
heard
of
moby
dick—but
it
was
not
moby
dick
that
took
off
thy
leg?”
“who
told
thee
that?”
cried
ahab
then
pausing
“aye
starbuck
aye
my
hearties
all
round
it
was
moby
dick
that
dismasted
me
moby
dick
that
brought
me
to
this
dead
stump
i
stand
on
now
aye
aye,”
he
shouted
with
a
terrific
loud
animal
sob
like
that
of
a
heart-stricken
moose
“aye
aye
it
was
that
accursed
white
whale
that
razed
me
made
a
poor
pegging
lubber
of
me
for
ever
and
a
day!”
then
tossing
both
arms
with
measureless
imprecations
he
shouted
out
“aye
aye
and
i’ll
chase
him
round
good
hope
and
round
the
horn
and
round
the
norway
maelstrom
and
round
perdition’s
flames
before
i
give
him
up
and
this
is
what
ye
have
shipped
for
men
to
chase
that
white
whale
on
both
sides
of
land
and
over
all
sides
of
earth
till
he
spouts
black
blood
and
rolls
fin
out
what
say
ye
men
will
ye
splice
hands
on
it
now
i
think
ye
do
look
brave.”
“aye
aye!”
shouted
the
harpooneers
and
seamen
running
closer
to
the
excited
old
man
“a
sharp
eye
for
the
white
whale
a
sharp
lance
for
moby
dick!”
“god
bless
ye,”
he
seemed
to
half
sob
and
half
shout
“god
bless
ye
men
steward
go
draw
the
great
measure
of
grog
but
what’s
this
long
face
about
mr
starbuck
wilt
thou
not
chase
the
white
whale
art
not
game
for
moby
dick?”
“i
am
game
for
his
crooked
jaw
and
for
the
jaws
of
death
too
captain
ahab
if
it
fairly
comes
in

way
of
the
business

follow

how
many
barrels
will
thy
vengeance
yield
thee
even
if
thou
gettest

captain
ahab
it

not
fetch
thee
much
in
our
nantucket
market.”
“nantucket

come
closer
starbuck
thou
requirest
a
little
lower
layer
if
money’s
to
be
the
measurer

then

me
tell
thee
that
my

will
fetch

_here!_”
“he
smites
his
chest,”
whispered
stubb
“what’s
that
for
methinks
it
rings
most
vast
but
hollow.”
“vengeance
on
a
dumb
brute!”
cried
starbuck
“that
simply
smote
thee
from
blindest
instinct
madness
to
be
enraged
with

captain
ahab
seems
blasphemous.”
“hark
ye

again—the

in

murmured

in
his
joy
at
the
enchanted
tacit
acquiescence
of
the

ahab
did
not
hear
his

from

nor

the
presaging

of

flap
of

sank

cried
ahab
receiving
the
brimming
pewter
and
turning
to
the
harpooneers
he
ordered
them
to
produce
their
weapons
then
ranging
them
before
him
near
the
capstan
with
their
harpoons
in
their
hands
while
his
three
mates
stood
at
his
side
with
their
lances
and
the
rest
of
the
ship’s
company
formed
a
circle
round
the
group
he
stood
for
an
instant
searchingly
eyeing
every
man
of
his
crew
but
those
wild
eyes
met
his
as
the
bloodshot
eyes
of

meet
the

ere
he
rushes
on
at

alas
only
to
fall
into
the
hidden
snare
of

“drink

he
cried
handing
the
heavy
charged

to
the
nearest

so
saying
with
extended
arm
he
grasped
the
three
level
radiating
lances
at
their
crossed
centre
while
so
doing
suddenly
and
nervously
twitched
them
meanwhile
glancing
intently
from
starbuck
to
stubb
from
stubb
to
flask
it
seemed
as
though
by
some
nameless
interior
volition
he
would
fain
have
shocked
into
them
the
same
fiery
emotion
accumulated
within
the
leyden
jar
of
his
own
magnetic
life
the
three
mates
quailed
before
his
strong
sustained
and

aspect
stubb
and

looked
sideways
from

the
honest
eye
of

fell
downright
“in

cried
ahab
“but

silently
obeying
the
order
the
three
harpooneers
now
stood
with
the
detached
iron
part
of
their
harpoons
some
three
feet
long
held
barbs
up
before
him

forthwith
slowly
going
from

to
the

he
brimmed
the

with
the
fiery
waters
from
the
pewter

the
long
barbed

goblets
were
lifted
and
to
cries
and
maledictions
against
the
white
whale
the
spirits
were
simultaneously
quaffed
down
with
a
hiss
starbuck
paled
and
turned
and
shivered
once
more
and
finally
the
replenished
pewter
went
the
rounds
among
the
frantic
crew
when
waving
his
free
hand
to
them
they
all
dispersed
and
ahab
retired

feeling
was
in

quenchless
feud
seemed
mine
with

i
learned
the
history
of
that
murderous
monster
against
whom
i
and
all
the
others
had
taken
our
oaths
of
violence
and
revenge
for
some
time
past
though
at
intervals
only
the
unaccompanied
secluded
white
whale
had
haunted
those
uncivilized
seas
mostly
frequented
by
the
sperm
whale
fishermen
but
not
all
of
them
knew
of
his
existence
only
a
few
of
them
comparatively
had
knowingly
seen
him
while
the
number
who
as
yet
had
actually
and
knowingly
given
battle
to
him
was
small
indeed
for
owing
to
the
large
number
of
whale-cruisers
the
disorderly
way
they
were
sprinkled
over
the
entire
watery
circumference
many
of
them
adventurously
pushing
their
quest
along
solitary
latitudes
so
as
seldom
or
never
for
a
whole
twelvemonth
or
more
on
a
stretch
to
encounter
a
single
news-telling
sail
of
any
sort
the
inordinate
length
of
each
separate
voyage
the
irregularity
of
the
times
of
sailing
from
home
all
these
with
other
circumstances
direct
and
indirect
long
obstructed
the
spread
through
the
whole
world-wide
whaling-fleet
of
the
special
individualizing
tidings
concerning
moby
dick
it
was
hardly
to
be
doubted
that
several
vessels
reported
to
have
encountered
at
such
or
such
a
time
or
on
such
or
such
a
meridian
a
sperm
whale
of
uncommon
magnitude
and
malignity
which
whale
after
doing
great
mischief
to
his
assailants
had
completely
escaped
them
to
some
minds
it
was
not
an
unfair
presumption
i
say
that
the
whale
in
question
must
have
been
no
other
than
moby
dick
yet
as
of
late
the
sperm
whale
fishery
had
been
marked
by
various
and
not
unfrequent
instances
of
great
ferocity
cunning
and
malice
in
the
monster
attacked
therefore
it
was
that
those
who
by
accident
ignorantly
gave
battle
to
moby
dick
such
hunters
perhaps
for
the
most
part
were
content
to
ascribe
the
peculiar
terror
he
bred
more
as
it
were
to
the
perils
of
the
sperm
whale
fishery
at
large
than
to
the
individual
cause
in
that
way
mostly
the
disastrous
encounter
between
ahab
and
the
whale
had
hitherto
been
popularly
regarded
and
as
for
those
who
previously
hearing
of
the
white
whale
by
chance
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
beginning
of
the
thing
they
had
every
one
of
them
almost
as
boldly
and
fearlessly
lowered
for
him
as
for
any
other
whale
of
that
species
but
at
length
such
calamities
did
ensue
in
these
assaults—not
restricted
to
sprained
wrists
and
ankles
broken
limbs
or
devouring
amputations—but
fatal
to
the
last
degree
of
fatality
those
repeated
disastrous
repulses
all
accumulating
and
piling
their
terrors
upon
moby
dick
those
things
had
gone
far
to
shake
the
fortitude
of
many
brave
hunters
to
whom
the
story
of
the
white
whale
had
eventually
come
nor
did
wild
rumors
of
all
sorts
fail
to
exaggerate
and
still
the
more
horrify
the
true
histories
of
these
deadly
encounters
for
not
only
do
fabulous
rumors
naturally
grow
out
of
the
very
body
of
all
surprising
terrible
events,—as
the
smitten
tree
gives
birth
to
its
fungi
but
in
maritime
life
far
more
than
in
that
of
terra
firma
wild
rumors
abound
wherever
there
is
any
adequate
reality
for
them
to
cling
to
and
as
the
sea
surpasses
the
land
in
this
matter
so
the
whale
fishery
surpasses
every
other
sort
of
maritime
life
in
the
wonderfulness
and
fearfulness
of
the
rumors
which
sometimes
circulate
there
for
not
only
are
whalemen
as
a
body
unexempt
from
that
ignorance
and
superstitiousness
hereditary
to
all
sailors
but
of
all
sailors
they
are
by
all
odds
the
most
directly
brought
into
contact
with
whatever
is
appallingly
astonishing
in
the
sea
face
to
face
they
not
only
eye
its
greatest
marvels
but
hand
to
jaw
give
battle
to
them
alone
in
such
remotest
waters
that
though
you
sailed
a
thousand
miles
and
passed
a
thousand
shores
you
would
not
come
to
any
chiseled
hearth-stone
or
aught
hospitable
beneath
that
part
of
the
sun
in
such
latitudes
and
longitudes
pursuing
too
such
a
calling
as
he
does
the
whaleman
is
wrapped
by
influences
all
tending
to
make
his
fancy
pregnant
with
many
a
mighty
birth
no
wonder
then
that
ever
gathering
volume
from
the
mere
transit
over
the
widest
watery
spaces
the
outblown
rumors
of
the
white
whale
did
in
the
end
incorporate
with
themselves
all
manner
of
morbid
hints
and
half-formed
fœtal
suggestions
of
supernatural
agencies
which
eventually
invested
moby
dick
with
new
terrors
unborrowed
from
anything
that
visibly
appears
so
that
in
many
cases
such
a
panic
did
he
finally
strike
that
few
who
by
those
rumors
at
least
had
heard
of
the
white
whale
few
of
those
hunters
were
willing
to
encounter
the
perils
of
his
jaw
but
there
were
still
other
and
more
vital
practical
influences
at
work
not
even
at
the
present
day
has
the
original
prestige
of
the
sperm
whale
as
fearfully
distinguished
from
all
other
species
of
the
leviathan
died
out
of
the
minds
of
the
whalemen
as
a
body
there
are
those
this
day
among
them
who
though
intelligent
and
courageous
enough
in
offering
battle
to
the
greenland
or
right
whale
would
perhaps—either
from
professional
inexperience
or
incompetency
or
timidity
decline
a
contest
with
the
sperm
whale
at
any
rate
there
are
plenty
of
whalemen
especially
among
those
whaling
nations
not
sailing
under
the
american
flag
who
have
never
hostilely
encountered
the
sperm
whale
but
whose
sole
knowledge
of
the
leviathan
is
restricted
to
the
ignoble
monster
primitively
pursued
in
the
north
seated
on
their
hatches
these
men
will
hearken
with
a
childish
fireside
interest
and
awe
to
the
wild
strange
tales
of
southern
whaling
nor
is
the
pre-eminent
tremendousness
of
the
great
sperm
whale
anywhere
more
feelingly
comprehended
than
on
board
of
those
prows
which
stem
him
and
as
if
the
now
tested
reality
of
his
might
had
in
former
legendary
times
thrown
its
shadow
before
it
we
find
some
book
naturalists—olassen
and
povelson—declaring
the
sperm
whale
not
only
to
be
a
consternation
to
every
other
creature
in
the
sea
but
also
to
be
so
incredibly
ferocious
as
continually
to
be
athirst
for
human
blood
nor
even
down
to
so
late
a
time
as
cuvier’s
were
these
or
almost
similar
impressions
effaced
for
in
his
natural
history
the
baron
himself
affirms
that
at
sight
of
the
sperm
whale
all
fish
sharks
included
are
“struck
with
the
most
lively
terrors,”
and
“often
in
the
precipitancy
of
their
flight
dash
themselves
against
the
rocks
with
such
violence
as
to
cause
instantaneous
death.”
and
however
the
general
experiences
in
the
fishery
may
amend
such
reports
as
these
yet
in
their
full
terribleness
even
to
the
bloodthirsty
item
of
povelson
the
superstitious
belief
in
them
is
in
some
vicissitudes
of
their
vocation
revived
in
the
minds
of
the
hunters
so
that
overawed
by
the
rumors
and
portents
concerning
him
not
a
few
of
the
fishermen
recalled
in
reference
to
moby
dick
the
earlier
days
of
the
sperm
whale
fishery
when
it
was
oftentimes
hard
to
induce
long
practised
right
whalemen
to
embark
in
the
perils
of
this
new
and
daring
warfare
such
men
protesting
that
although
other
leviathans
might
be
hopefully
pursued
yet
to
chase
and
point
lance
at
such
an
apparition
as
the
sperm
whale
was
not
for
mortal
man
that
to
attempt
it
would
be
inevitably
to
be
torn
into
a
quick
eternity
on
this
head
there
are
some
remarkable
documents
that
may
be
consulted
nevertheless
some
there
were
who
even
in
the
face
of
these
things
were
ready
to
give
chase
to
moby
dick
and
a
still
greater
number
who
chancing
only
to
hear
of
him
distantly
and
vaguely
without
the
specific
details
of
any
certain
calamity
and
without
superstitious
accompaniments
were
sufficiently
hardy
not
to
flee
from
the
battle
if
offered
one
of
the
wild
suggestions
referred
to
as
at
last
coming
to
be
linked
with
the
white
whale
in
the
minds
of
the
superstitiously
inclined
was
the
unearthly
conceit
that
moby
dick
was
ubiquitous
that
he
had
actually
been
encountered
in
opposite
latitudes
at
one
and
the
same
instant
of
time
nor
credulous
as
such
minds
must
have
been
was
this
conceit
altogether
without
some
faint
show
of
superstitious
probability
for
as
the
secrets
of
the
currents
in
the
seas
have
never
yet
been
divulged
even
to
the
most
erudite
research
so
the
hidden
ways
of
the
sperm
whale
when
beneath
the
surface
remain
in
great
part
unaccountable
to
his
pursuers
and
from
time
to
time
have
originated
the
most
curious
and
contradictory
speculations
regarding
them
especially
concerning
the
mystic
modes
whereby
after
sounding
to
a
great
depth
he
transports
himself
with
such
vast
swiftness
to
the
most
widely
distant
points
it
is
a
thing
well
known
to
both
american
and
english
whale-ships
and
as
well
a
thing
placed
upon
authoritative
record
years
ago
by
scoresby
that
some
whales
have
been
captured
far
north
in
the
pacific
in
whose
bodies
have
been
found
the
barbs
of
harpoons
darted
in
the
greenland
seas
nor
is
it
to
be
gainsaid
that
in
some
of
these
instances
it
has
been
declared
that
the
interval
of
time
between
the
two
assaults
could
not
have
exceeded
very
many
days
hence
by
inference
it
has
been
believed
by
some
whalemen
that
the
nor’
west
passage
so
long
a
problem
to
man
was
never
a
problem
to
the
whale
so
that
here
in
the
real
living
experience
of
living
men
the
prodigies
related
in
old
times
of
the
inland
strello
mountain
in
portugal
near
whose
top
there
was
said
to
be
a
lake
in
which
the
wrecks
of
ships
floated
up
to
the
surface
and
that
still
more
wonderful
story
of
the
arethusa
fountain
near
syracuse
whose
waters
were
believed
to
have
come
from
the
holy
land
by
an
underground
passage
these
fabulous
narrations
are
almost
fully
equalled
by
the
realities
of
the
whalemen
forced
into
familiarity
then
with
such
prodigies
as
these
and
knowing
that
after
repeated
intrepid
assaults
the
white
whale
had
escaped
alive
it
cannot
be
much
matter
of
surprise
that
some
whalemen
should
go
still
further
in
their
superstitions
declaring
moby
dick
not
only
ubiquitous
but
immortal
for
immortality
is
but
ubiquity
in
time
that
though
groves
of
spears
should
be
planted
in
his
flanks
he
would
still
swim
away
unharmed
or
if
indeed
he
should
ever
be
made
to
spout
thick
blood
such
a
sight
would
be
but
a
ghastly
deception
for
again
in
unensanguined
billows
hundreds
of
leagues
away
his
unsullied
jet
would
once
more
be
seen
but
even
stripped
of
these
supernatural
surmisings
there
was
enough
in
the
earthly
make
and
incontestable
character
of
the
monster
to
strike
the
imagination
with
unwonted
power
for
it
was
not
so
much
his
uncommon
bulk
that
so
much
distinguished
him
from
other
sperm
whales
but
as
was
elsewhere
thrown
out—a
peculiar
snow-white
wrinkled
forehead
and
a
high
pyramidical
white
hump
these
were
his
prominent
features
the
tokens
whereby
even
in
the
limitless
uncharted
seas
he
revealed
his
identity
at
a
long
distance
to
those
who
knew
him
the
rest
of
his
body
was
so
streaked
and
spotted
and
marbled
with
the
same
shrouded
hue
that
in
the
end
he
had
gained
his
distinctive
appellation
of
the
white
whale
a
name
indeed
literally
justified
by
his
vivid
aspect
when
seen
gliding
at
high
noon
through
a
dark
blue
sea
leaving
a
milky-way
wake
of
creamy
foam
all
spangled
with
golden
gleamings
nor
was
it
his
unwonted
magnitude
nor
his
remarkable
hue
nor
yet
his
deformed
lower
jaw
that
so
much
invested
the
whale
with
natural
terror
as
that
unexampled
intelligent
malignity
which
according
to
specific
accounts
he
had
over
and
over
again
evinced
in
his
assaults
more
than
all
his
treacherous
retreats
struck
more
of
dismay
than
perhaps
aught
else
for
when
swimming
before
his
exulting
pursuers
with
every
apparent
symptom
of
alarm
he
had
several
times
been
known
to
turn
round
suddenly
and
bearing
down
upon
them
either
stave
their
boats
to
splinters
or
drive
them
back
in
consternation
to
their
ship
already
several
fatalities
had
attended
his
chase
but
though
similar
disasters
however
little
bruited
ashore
were
by
no
means
unusual
in
the
fishery
yet
in
most
instances
such
seemed
the
white
whale’s
infernal
aforethought
of
ferocity
that
every
dismembering
or
death
that
he
caused
was
not
wholly
regarded
as
having
been
inflicted
by
an
unintelligent
agent
judge
then
to
what
pitches
of
inflamed
distracted
fury
the
minds
of
his
more
desperate
hunters
were
impelled
when
amid
the
chips
of
chewed
boats
and
the
sinking
limbs
of
torn
comrades
they
swam
out
of
the
white
curds
of
the
whale’s
direful
wrath
into
the
serene
exasperating
sunlight
that
smiled
on
as
if
at
a
birth
or
a
bridal
his
three
boats
stove
around
him
and
oars
and
men
both
whirling
in
the
eddies
one
captain
seizing
the
line-knife
from
his
broken
prow
had
dashed
at
the
whale
as
an
arkansas
duellist
at
his
foe
blindly
seeking
with
a
six
inch
blade
to
reach
the
fathom-deep
life
of
the
whale
that
captain
was
ahab
and
then
it
was
that
suddenly
sweeping
his
sickle-shaped
lower
jaw
beneath
him
moby
dick
had
reaped
away
ahab’s
leg
as
a
mower
a
blade
of
grass
in
the
field
no
turbaned
turk
no
hired
venetian
or
malay
could
have
smote
him
with
more
seeming
malice
small
reason
was
there
to
doubt
then
that
ever
since
that
almost
fatal
encounter
ahab
had
cherished
a
wild
vindictiveness
against
the
whale
all
the
more
fell
for
that
in
his
frantic
morbidness
he
at
last
came
to
identify
with
him
not
only
all
his
bodily
woes
but
all
his
intellectual
and
spiritual
exasperations
the
white
whale
swam
before
him
as
the
monomaniac
incarnation
of
all
those
malicious
agencies
which
some
deep
men
feel
eating
in
them
till
they
are
left
living
on
with
half
a
heart
and
half
a
lung
that
intangible
malignity
which
has
been
from
the
beginning
to
whose
dominion
even
the
modern
christians
ascribe
one-half
of
the
worlds
which
the
ancient
ophites
of
the
east
reverenced
in
their
statue
devil;—ahab
did
not
fall
down
and
worship
it
like
them
but
deliriously
transferring
its
idea
to
the
abhorred
white
whale
he
pitted
himself
all
mutilated
against
it
all
that
most
maddens
and
torments
all
that
stirs
up
the
lees
of
things
all
truth
with
malice
in
it
all
that
cracks
the
sinews
and
cakes
the
brain
all
the
subtle
demonisms
of
life
and
thought
all
evil
to
crazy
ahab
were
visibly
personified
and
made
practically
assailable
in
moby
dick
he
piled
upon
the
whale’s
white
hump
the
sum
of
all
the
general
rage
and
hate
felt
by
his
whole
race
from
adam
down
and
then
as
if
his
chest
had
been
a
mortar
he
burst
his
hot
heart’s
shell
upon
it
it
is
not
probable
that
this
monomania
in
him
took
its
instant
rise
at
the
precise
time
of
his
bodily
dismemberment
then
in
darting
at
the
monster
knife
in
hand
he
had
but
given
loose
to
a
sudden
passionate
corporal
animosity
and
when
he
received
the
stroke
that
tore
him
he
probably
but
felt
the
agonizing
bodily
laceration
but
nothing
more
yet
when
by
this
collision
forced
to
turn
towards
home
and
for
long
months
of
days
and
weeks
ahab
and
anguish
lay
stretched
together
in
one
hammock
rounding
in
mid
winter
that
dreary
howling
patagonian
cape
then
it
was
that
his
torn
body
and
gashed
soul
bled
into
one
another
and
so
interfusing
made
him
mad
that
it
was
only
then
on
the
homeward
voyage
after
the
encounter
that
the
final
monomania
seized
him
seems
all
but
certain
from
the
fact
that
at
intervals
during
the
passage
he
was
a
raving
lunatic
and
though
unlimbed
of
a
leg
yet
such
vital
strength
yet
lurked
in
his
egyptian
chest
and
was
moreover
intensified
by
his
delirium
that
his
mates
were
forced
to
lace
him
fast
even
there
as
he
sailed
raving
in
his
hammock
in
a
strait-jacket
he
swung
to
the
mad
rockings
of
the
gales
and
when
running
into
more
sufferable
latitudes
the
ship
with
mild
stun’sails
spread
floated
across
the
tranquil
tropics
and
to
all
appearances
the
old
man’s
delirium
seemed
left
behind
him
with
the
cape
horn
swells
and
he
came
forth
from
his
dark
den
into
the
blessed
light
and
air
even
then
when
he
bore
that
firm
collected
front
however
pale
and
issued
his
calm
orders
once
again
and
his
mates
thanked
god
the
direful
madness
was
now
gone
even
then
ahab
in
his
hidden
self
raved
on
human
madness
is
oftentimes
a
cunning
and
most
feline
thing
when
you
think
it
fled
it
may
have
but
become
transfigured
into
some
still
subtler
form
ahab’s
full
lunacy
subsided
not
but
deepeningly
contracted
like
the
unabated
hudson
when
that
noble
northman
flows
narrowly
but
unfathomably
through
the
highland
gorge
but
as
in
his
narrow-flowing
monomania
not
one
jot
of
ahab’s
broad
madness
had
been
left
behind
so
in
that
broad
madness
not
one
jot
of
his
great
natural
intellect
had
perished
that
before
living
agent
now
became
the
living
instrument
if
such
a
furious
trope
may
stand
his
special
lunacy
stormed
his
general
sanity
and
carried
it
and
turned
all
its
concentred
cannon
upon
its
own
mad
mark
so
that
far
from
having
lost
his
strength
ahab
to
that
one
end
did
now
possess
a
thousand
fold
more
potency
than
ever
he
had
sanely
brought
to
bear
upon
any
one
reasonable
object
this
is
much
yet
ahab’s
larger
darker
deeper
part
remains
unhinted
but
vain
to
popularize
profundities
and
all
truth
is
profound
winding
far
down
from
within
the
very
heart
of
this
spiked
hotel
de
cluny
where
we
here
stand—however
grand
and
wonderful
now
quit
it;—and
take
your
way
ye
nobler
sadder
souls
to
those
vast
roman
halls
of
thermes
where
far
beneath
the
fantastic
towers
of
man’s
upper
earth
his
root
of
grandeur
his
whole
awful
essence
sits
in
bearded
state
an
antique
buried
beneath
antiquities
and
throned
on
torsoes
so
with
a
broken
throne
the
great
gods
mock
that
captive
king
so
like
a
caryatid
he
patient
sits
upholding
on
his
frozen
brow
the
piled
entablatures
of
ages
wind
ye
down
there
ye
prouder
sadder
souls
question
that
proud
sad
king
a
family

aye
he
did
beget
ye
ye
young
exiled
royalties
and
from
your
grim
sire
only
will
the
old
state-secret
come
now
in
his
heart
ahab
had
some
glimpse
of
this
namely
all
my
means
are
sane
my
motive
and
my
object
mad
yet
without
power
to
kill
or
change
or
shun
the
fact
he
likewise
knew
that
to
mankind
he
did
long
dissemble
in
some
sort
did
still
but
that
thing
of
his
dissembling
was
only
subject
to
his
perceptibility
not
to
his
will
determinate
nevertheless
so
well
did
he
succeed
in
that
dissembling
that
when
with
ivory
leg
he
stepped
ashore
at
last
no
nantucketer
thought
him
otherwise
than
but
naturally
grieved
and
that
to
the
quick
with
the
terrible
casualty
which
had
overtaken
him
the
report
of
his
undeniable
delirium
at
sea
was
likewise
popularly
ascribed
to
a
kindred
cause
and
so
too
all
the
added
moodiness
which
always
afterwards
to
the
very
day
of
sailing
in
the
pequod
on
the
present
voyage
sat
brooding
on
his
brow
nor
is
it
so
very
unlikely
that
far
from
distrusting
his
fitness
for
another
whaling
voyage
on
account
of
such
dark
symptoms
the
calculating
people
of
that
prudent
isle
were
inclined
to
harbor
the
conceit
that
for
those
very
reasons
he
was
all
the
better
qualified
and
set
on
edge
for
a
pursuit
so
full
of
rage
and
wildness
as
the
bloody
hunt
of
whales
gnawed
within
and
scorched
without
with
the
infixed
unrelenting
fangs
of
some
incurable
idea
such
an
one
could
he
be
found
would
seem
the
very
man
to
dart
his
iron
and
lift
his
lance
against
the
most
appalling
of
all
brutes
or
if
for
any
reason
thought
to
be
corporeally
incapacitated
for
that
yet
such
an
one
would
seem
superlatively
competent
to
cheer
and
howl
on
his
underlings
to
the
attack
but
be
all
this
as
it
may
certain
it
is
that
with
the
mad
secret
of
his
unabated
rage
bolted
up
and
keyed
in
him
ahab
had
purposely
sailed
upon
the
present
voyage
with
the
one
only
and
all-engrossing
object
of
hunting
the
white
whale
had
any
one
of
his
old
acquaintances
on
shore
but
half
dreamed
of
what
was
lurking
in
him
then
how
soon
would
their
aghast
and
righteous
souls
have
wrenched
the
ship
from
such
a
fiendish
man
they
were
bent
on
profitable
cruises
the
profit
to
be
counted
down
in
dollars
from
the
mint
he
was
intent
on
an
audacious
immitigable
and
supernatural
revenge
here
then
was
this
grey-headed
ungodly
old
man
chasing
with
curses
a
job’s
whale
round
the
world
at
the
head
of
a
crew
too
chiefly
made
up
of
mongrel
renegades
and
castaways
and
cannibals—morally
enfeebled
also
by
the
incompetence
of
mere
unaided
virtue
or
right-mindedness
in
starbuck
the
invulnerable
jollity
of
indifference
and
recklessness
in
stubb
and
the
pervading
mediocrity
in
flask
such
a
crew
so
officered
seemed
specially
picked
and
packed
by
some
infernal
fatality
to
help
him
to
his
monomaniac
revenge
how
it
was
that
they
so
aboundingly
responded
to
the
old
man’s
ire—by
what
evil
magic
their
souls
were
possessed
that
at
times
his
hate
seemed
almost
theirs
the
white
whale
as
much
their
insufferable
foe
as
his
how
all
this
came
to
be—what
the
white
whale
was
to
them
or
how
to
their
unconscious
understandings
also
in
some
dim
unsuspected
way
he
might
have
seemed
the
gliding
great
demon
of
the
seas
of
life,—all
this
to
explain
would
be
to
dive
deeper
than
ishmael
can
go
the
subterranean
miner
that
works
in
us
all

can
one
tell
whither
leads
his
shaft
by
the
ever
shifting
muffled
sound
of
his
pick
who
does
not
feel
the
irresistible
arm
drag
what
skiff
in

of
a
seventy-four
can
stand
still
for

i
gave
myself
up
to
the
abandonment
of
the
time
and

all
a-rush

chapter

the
whiteness
of
the
whale
what
the
white
whale
was
to
ahab
has
been
hinted
what
at
times
he
was
to
me
as
yet
remains
unsaid
aside
from
those
more
obvious
considerations
touching
moby
dick
which
could
not
but
occasionally
awaken
in
any
man’s
soul
some
alarm
there
was
another
thought
or
rather
vague
nameless
horror
concerning
him
which
at
times
by
its
intensity
completely
overpowered
all
the
rest
and
yet
so
mystical
and
well
nigh
ineffable
was
it
that
i
almost
despair
of
putting
it
in
a
comprehensible
form
it
was
the
whiteness
of
the
whale
that
above
all
things
appalled
me
but
how
can
i
hope
to
explain
myself
here
and
yet
in
some
dim
random
way
explain
myself
i
must
else
all
these
chapters
might
be
naught
though
in
many
natural
objects
whiteness
refiningly
enhances
beauty
as
if
imparting
some
special
virtue
of
its
own
as
in
marbles
japonicas
and
pearls
and
though
various
nations
have
in
some
way
recognised
a
certain
royal
preeminence
in
this
hue
even
the
barbaric
grand
old
kings
of
pegu
placing
the
title
“lord
of
the
white
elephants”
above
all
their
other
magniloquent
ascriptions
of
dominion
and
the
modern
kings
of
siam
unfurling
the
same
snow-white
quadruped
in
the
royal
standard
and
the
hanoverian
flag
bearing
the
one
figure
of
a
snow-white
charger
and
the
great
austrian
empire
cæsarian
heir
to
overlording
rome
having
for
the
imperial
colour
the
same
imperial
hue
and
though
this
pre-eminence
in
it
applies
to
the
human
race
itself
giving
the
white
man
ideal
mastership
over
every
dusky
tribe
and
though
besides
all
this
whiteness
has
been
even
made
significant
of
gladness
for
among
the
romans
a
white
stone
marked
a
joyful
day
and
though
in
other
mortal
sympathies
and
symbolizings
this
same
hue
is
made
the
emblem
of
many
touching
noble
things—the
innocence
of
brides
the
benignity
of
age
though
among
the
red
men
of
america
the
giving
of
the
white
belt
of
wampum
was
the
deepest
pledge
of
honor
though
in
many
climes
whiteness
typifies
the
majesty
of
justice
in
the
ermine
of
the
judge
and
contributes
to
the
daily
state
of
kings
and
queens
drawn
by
milk-white
steeds
though
even
in
the
higher
mysteries
of
the
most
august
religions
it
has
been
made
the
symbol
of
the
divine
spotlessness
and
power
by
the
persian
fire
worshippers
the
white
forked
flame
being
held
the
holiest
on
the
altar
and
in
the
greek
mythologies
great
jove
himself
being
made
incarnate
in
a
snow-white
bull
and
though
to
the
noble
iroquois
the
midwinter
sacrifice
of
the
sacred
white
dog
was
by
far
the
holiest
festival
of
their
theology
that
spotless
faithful
creature
being
held
the
purest
envoy
they
could
send
to
the
great
spirit
with
the
annual
tidings
of
their
own
fidelity
and
though
directly
from
the
latin
word
for
white
all
christian
priests
derive
the
name
of
one
part
of
their
sacred
vesture
the
alb
or
tunic
worn
beneath
the
cassock
and
though
among
the
holy
pomps
of
the
romish
faith
white
is
specially
employed
in
the
celebration
of
the
passion
of
our
lord
though
in
the
vision
of
st
john
white
robes
are
given
to
the
redeemed
and
the
four-and-twenty
elders
stand
clothed
in
white
before
the
great
white
throne
and
the
holy
one
that
sitteth
there
white
like
wool
yet
for
all
these
accumulated
associations
with
whatever
is
sweet
and
honorable
and
sublime
there
yet
lurks
an
elusive
something
in
the
innermost
idea
of
this
hue
which
strikes
more
of
panic
to
the
soul
than
that
redness
which
affrights
in
blood
this
elusive
quality
it
is
which
causes
the
thought
of
whiteness
when
divorced
from
more
kindly
associations
and
coupled
with
any
object
terrible
in
itself
to
heighten
that
terror
to
the
furthest
bounds
witness
the
white
bear
of
the
poles
and
the
white
shark
of
the
tropics
what
but
their
smooth
flaky
whiteness
makes
them
the
transcendent
horrors
they
are
that
ghastly
whiteness
it
is
which
imparts
such
an
abhorrent
mildness
even
more
loathsome
than
terrific
to
the
dumb
gloating
of
their
aspect
so
that
not
the
fierce-fanged
tiger
in
his
heraldic
coat
can
so
stagger
courage
as
the
white-shrouded
bear
or
shark.*
*with
reference
to
the
polar
bear
it
may
possibly
be
urged
by
him
who
would
fain
go
still
deeper
into
this
matter
that
it
is
not
the
whiteness
separately
regarded
which
heightens
the
intolerable
hideousness
of
that
brute
for
analysed
that
heightened
hideousness
it
might
be
said
only
rises
from
the
circumstance
that
the
irresponsible
ferociousness
of
the
creature
stands
invested
in
the
fleece
of
celestial
innocence
and
love
and
hence
by
bringing
together
two
such
opposite
emotions
in
our
minds
the
polar
bear
frightens
us
with
so
unnatural
a
contrast
but
even
assuming
all
this
to
be
true
yet
were
it
not
for
the
whiteness
you
would
not
have
that
intensified
terror
as
for
the
white
shark
the
white
gliding
ghostliness
of
repose
in
that
creature
when
beheld
in
his
ordinary
moods
strangely
tallies
with
the
same
quality
in
the
polar
quadruped
this
peculiarity
is
most
vividly
hit
by
the
french
in
the
name
they
bestow
upon
that
fish
the
romish
mass
for
the
dead
begins
with
“requiem
eternam”
eternal
rest
whence
_requiem_
denominating
the
mass
itself
and
any
other
funeral
music
now
in
allusion
to
the
white
silent
stillness
of
death
in
this
shark
and
the
mild
deadliness
of
his
habits
the
french
call
him
_requin_
bethink
thee
of
the
albatross
whence
come
those
clouds
of
spiritual
wonderment
and
pale
dread
in
which
that
white
phantom
sails
in
all
imaginations
not
coleridge
first
threw
that
spell
but
god’s
great
unflattering
laureate
nature.*
*i
remember
the
first
albatross
i
ever
saw
it
was
during
a
prolonged
gale
in
waters
hard
upon
the
antarctic
seas
from
my
forenoon
watch
below
i
ascended
to
the
overclouded
deck
and
there
dashed
upon
the
main
hatches
i
saw
a
regal
feathery
thing
of
unspotted
whiteness
and
with
a
hooked
roman
bill
sublime
at
intervals
it
arched
forth
its
vast
archangel
wings
as
if
to
embrace
some
holy
ark
wondrous
flutterings
and
throbbings
shook
it
though
bodily
unharmed
it
uttered
cries
as
some
king’s
ghost
in
supernatural
distress
through
its
inexpressible
strange
eyes
methought
i
peeped
to
secrets
which
took
hold
of
god
as
abraham
before
the
angels
i
bowed
myself
the
white
thing
was
so
white
its
wings
so
wide
and
in
those
for
ever
exiled
waters
i
had
lost
the
miserable
warping
memories
of
traditions
and
of
towns
long
i
gazed
at
that
prodigy
of
plumage
i
cannot
tell
can
only
hint
the
things
that
darted
through
me
then
but
at
last
i
awoke
and
turning
asked
a
sailor
what
bird
was
this
a
goney
he
replied
goney
never
had
heard
that
name
before
is
it
conceivable
that
this
glorious
thing
is
utterly
unknown
to
men
ashore
never
but
some
time
after
i
learned
that
goney
was
some
seaman’s
name
for
albatross
so
that
by
no
possibility
could
coleridge’s
wild
rhyme
have
had
aught
to
do
with
those
mystical
impressions
which
were
mine
when
i
saw
that
bird
upon
our
deck
for
neither
had
i
then
read
the
rhyme
nor
knew
the
bird
to
be
an
albatross
yet
in
saying
this
i
do
but
indirectly
burnish
a
little
brighter
the
noble
merit
of
the
poem
and
the
poet
i
assert
then
that
in
the
wondrous
bodily
whiteness
of
the
bird
chiefly
lurks
the
secret
of
the
spell
a
truth
the
more
evinced
in
this
that
by
a
solecism
of
terms
there
are
birds
called
grey
albatrosses
and
these
i
have
frequently
seen
but
never
with
such
emotions
as
when
i
beheld
the
antarctic
fowl
but
how
had
the
mystic
thing
been
caught
whisper
it
not
and
i
will
tell
with
a
treacherous
hook
and
line
as
the
fowl
floated
on
the
sea
at
last
the
captain
made
a
postman
of
it
tying
a
lettered
leathern
tally
round
its
neck
with
the
ship’s
time
and
place
and
then
letting
it
escape
but
i
doubt
not
that
leathern
tally
meant
for
man
was
taken
off
in
heaven
when
the
white
fowl
flew
to
join
the
wing-folding
the
invoking
and
adoring
cherubim
most
famous
in
our
western
annals
and
indian
traditions
is
that
of
the
white
steed
of
the
prairies
a
magnificent
milk-white
charger
large-eyed
small-headed
bluff-chested
and
with
the
dignity
of
a
thousand
monarchs
in
his
lofty
overscorning
carriage
he
was
the
elected
xerxes
of
vast
herds
of
wild
horses
whose
pastures
in
those
days
were
only
fenced
by
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
alleghanies
at
their
flaming
head
he
westward
trooped
it
like
that
chosen
star
which
every
evening
leads
on
the
hosts
of
light
the
flashing
cascade
of
his
mane
the
curving
comet
of
his
tail
invested
him
with
housings
more
resplendent
than
gold
and
silver-beaters
could
have
furnished
him
a
most
imperial
and
archangelical
apparition
of
that
unfallen
western
world
which
to
the
eyes
of
the
old
trappers
and
hunters
revived
the
glories
of
those
primeval
times
when
adam
walked
majestic
as
a
god
bluff-browed
and
fearless
as
this
mighty
steed
whether
marching
amid
his
aides
and
marshals
in
the
van
of
countless
cohorts
that
endlessly
streamed
it
over
the
plains
like
an
ohio
or
whether
with
his
circumambient
subjects
browsing
all
around
at
the
horizon
the
white
steed
gallopingly
reviewed
them
with
warm
nostrils
reddening
through
his
cool
milkiness
in
whatever
aspect
he
presented
himself
always
to
the
bravest
indians
he
was
the
object
of
trembling
reverence
and
awe
nor
can
it
be
questioned
from
what
stands
on
legendary
record
of
this
noble
horse
that
it
was
his
spiritual
whiteness
chiefly
which
so
clothed
him
with
divineness
and
that
this
divineness
had
that
in
it
which
though
commanding
worship
at
the
same
time
enforced
a
certain
nameless
terror
but
there
are
other
instances
where
this
whiteness
loses
all
that
accessory
and
strange
glory
which
invests
it
in
the
white
steed
and
albatross
what
is
it
that
in
the
albino
man
so
peculiarly
repels
and
often
shocks
the
eye
as
that
sometimes
he
is
loathed
by
his
own
kith
and
kin
it
is
that
whiteness
which
invests
him
a
thing
expressed
by
the
name
he
bears
the
albino
is
as
well
made
as
other
men—has
no
substantive
deformity—and
yet
this
mere
aspect
of
all-pervading
whiteness
makes
him
more
strangely
hideous
than
the
ugliest
abortion
why
should
this
be
so
nor
in
quite
other
aspects
does
nature
in
her
least
palpable
but
not
the
less
malicious
agencies
fail
to
enlist
among
her
forces
this
crowning
attribute
of
the
terrible
from
its
snowy
aspect
the
gauntleted
ghost
of
the
southern
seas
has
been
denominated
the
white
squall
nor
in
some
historic
instances
has
the
art
of
human
malice
omitted
so
potent
an
auxiliary
how
wildly
it
heightens
the
effect
of
that
passage
in
froissart
when
masked
in
the
snowy
symbol
of
their
faction
the
desperate
white
hoods
of
ghent
murder
their
bailiff
in
the
market-place
nor
in
some
things
does
the
common
hereditary
experience
of
all
mankind
fail
to
bear
witness
to
the
supernaturalism
of
this
hue
it
cannot
well
be
doubted
that
the
one
visible
quality
in
the
aspect
of
the
dead
which
most
appals
the
gazer
is
the
marble
pallor
lingering
there
as
if
indeed
that
pallor
were
as
much
like
the
badge
of
consternation
in
the
other
world
as
of
mortal
trepidation
here
and
from
that
pallor
of
the
dead
we
borrow
the
expressive
hue
of
the
shroud
in
which
we
wrap
them
nor
even
in
our
superstitions
do
we
fail
to
throw
the
same
snowy
mantle
round
our
phantoms
all
ghosts
rising
in
a
milk-white
fog—yea
while
these
terrors
seize
us
let
us
add
that
even
the
king
of
terrors
when
personified
by
the
evangelist
rides
on
his
pallid
horse
therefore
in
his
other
moods
symbolize
whatever
grand
or
gracious
thing
he
will
by
whiteness
no
man
can
deny
that
in
its
profoundest
idealized
significance
it
calls
up
a
peculiar
apparition
to
the
soul
but
though
without
dissent
this
point
be
fixed
how
is
mortal
man
to
account
for
it
to
analyse
it
would
seem
impossible
can
we
then
by
the
citation
of
some
of
those
instances
wherein
this
thing
of
whiteness—though
for
the
time
either
wholly
or
in
great
part
stripped
of
all
direct
associations
calculated
to
impart
to
it
aught
fearful
but
nevertheless
is
found
to
exert
over
us
the
same
sorcery
however
modified;—can
we
thus
hope
to
light
upon
some
chance
clue
to
conduct
us
to
the
hidden
cause
we
seek
let
us
try
but
in
a
matter
like
this
subtlety
appeals
to
subtlety
and
without
imagination
no
man
can
follow
another
into
these
halls
and
though
doubtless
some
at
least
of
the
imaginative
impressions
about
to
be
presented
may
have
been
shared
by
most
men
yet
few
perhaps
were
entirely
conscious
of
them
at
the
time
and
therefore
may
not
be
able
to
recall
them
now
why
to
the
man
of
untutored
ideality
who
happens
to
be
but
loosely
acquainted
with
the
peculiar
character
of
the
day
does
the
bare
mention
of
whitsuntide
marshal
in
the
fancy
such
long
dreary
speechless
processions
of
slow-pacing
pilgrims
down-cast
and
hooded
with
new-fallen
snow
or
to
the
unread
unsophisticated
protestant
of
the
middle
american
states
why
does
the
passing
mention
of
a
white
friar
or
a
white
nun
evoke
such
an
eyeless
statue
in
the
soul
or
what
is
there
apart
from
the
traditions
of
dungeoned
warriors
and
kings
which
will
not
wholly
account
for
it
that
makes
the
white
tower
of
london
tell
so
much
more
strongly
on
the
imagination
of
an
untravelled
american
than
those
other
storied
structures
its
neighbors—the
byward
tower
or
even
the
bloody
and
those
sublimer
towers
the
white
mountains
of
new
hampshire
whence
in
peculiar
moods
comes
that
gigantic
ghostliness
over
the
soul
at
the
bare
mention
of
that
name
while
the
thought
of
virginia’s
blue
ridge
is
full
of
a
soft
dewy
distant
dreaminess
or
why
irrespective
of
all
latitudes
and
longitudes
does
the
name
of
the
white
sea
exert
such
a
spectralness
over
the
fancy
while
that
of
the
yellow
sea
lulls
us
with
mortal
thoughts
of
long
lacquered
mild
afternoons
on
the
waves
followed
by
the
gaudiest
and
yet
sleepiest
of
sunsets
or
to
choose
a
wholly
unsubstantial
instance
purely
addressed
to
the
fancy
why
in
reading
the
old
fairy
tales
of
central
europe
does
“the
tall
pale
man”
of
the
hartz
forests
whose
changeless
pallor
unrustlingly
glides
through
the
green
of
the
groves—why
is
this
phantom
more
terrible
than
all
the
whooping
imps
of
the
blocksburg
nor
is
it
altogether
the
remembrance
of
her
cathedral-toppling
earthquakes
nor
the
stampedoes
of
her
frantic
seas
nor
the
tearlessness
of
arid
skies
that
never
rain
nor
the
sight
of
her
wide
field
of
leaning
spires
wrenched
cope-stones
and
crosses
all
adroop
like
canted
yards
of
anchored
fleets
and
her
suburban
avenues
of
house-walls
lying
over
upon
each
other
as
a
tossed
pack
of
cards;—it
is
not
these
things
alone
which
make
tearless
lima
the
strangest
saddest
city
thou
can’st
see
for
lima
has
taken
the
white
veil
and
there
is
a
higher
horror
in
this
whiteness
of
her
woe
old
as
pizarro
this
whiteness
keeps
her
ruins
for
ever
new
admits
not
the
cheerful
greenness
of
complete
decay
spreads
over
her
broken
ramparts
the
rigid
pallor
of
an
apoplexy
that
fixes
its
own
distortions
i
know
that
to
the
common
apprehension
this
phenomenon
of
whiteness
is
not
confessed
to
be
the
prime
agent
in
exaggerating
the
terror
of
objects
otherwise
terrible
nor
to
the
unimaginative
mind
is
there
aught
of
terror
in
those
appearances
whose
awfulness
to
another
mind
almost
solely
consists
in
this
one
phenomenon
especially
when
exhibited
under
any
form
at
all
approaching
to
muteness
or
universality
what
i
mean
by
these
two
statements
may
perhaps
be
respectively
elucidated
by
the
following
examples
first
the
mariner
when
drawing
nigh
the
coasts
of
foreign
lands
if
by
night
he
hear
the
roar
of
breakers
starts
to
vigilance
and
feels
just
enough
of
trepidation
to
sharpen
all
his
faculties
but
under
precisely
similar
circumstances
let
him
be
called
from
his
hammock
to
view
his
ship
sailing
through
a
midnight
sea
of
milky
whiteness—as
if
from
encircling
headlands
shoals
of
combed
white
bears
were
swimming
round
him
then
he
feels
a
silent
superstitious
dread
the
shrouded
phantom
of

the

naught

perhaps
in

of
the

reigning
at

the
natural
conceit
of

much
the

is
it
with

with

indifference
views
an

prairie
sheeted
with

no

break
the

by

me
why
this
strong
young
colt
foaled
in
some
peaceful
valley
of
vermont
far
removed
from
all
beasts
of
prey—why
is
it
that
upon
the
sunniest
day
if
you
but
shake
a
fresh
buffalo
robe
behind
him
so
that
he
cannot
even
see
it
but
only
smells
its
wild
animal
muskiness—why
will
he
start
snort
and
with
bursting
eyes
paw
the
ground
in
phrensies
of
affright
there
is
no
remembrance
in
him
of
any
gorings
of
wild
creatures
in
his
green
northern
home
so
that
the
strange
muskiness
he
smells
cannot
recall
to
him
anything
associated
with
the
experience
of
former
perils
for
what
knows
he
this
new
england
colt
of
the
black
bisons
of
distant
oregon
no
but
here
thou
beholdest
even
in
a
dumb
brute
the
instinct
of
the
knowledge
of
the
demonism
in
the
world
though
thousands
of
miles
from
oregon
still
when
he
smells
that
savage
musk
the
rending
goring
bison
herds
are
as
present
as
to
the
deserted
wild
foal
of
the
prairies
which
this
instant
they
may
be
trampling
into
dust
thus
then
the
muffled
rollings
of
a
milky
sea
the
bleak
rustlings
of
the
festooned
frosts
of
mountains
the
desolate
shiftings
of
the
windrowed
snows
of
prairies
all
these
to
ishmael
are
as
the
shaking
of
that
buffalo
robe
to
the
frightened
colt
though
neither
knows
where
lie
the
nameless
things
of
which
the
mystic
sign
gives
forth
such
hints
yet
with
me
as
with
the
colt
somewhere
those
things
must
exist
though
in
many
of
its
aspects
this
visible
world
seems
formed
in
love
the
invisible
spheres
were
formed
in
fright
but
not
yet
have
we
solved
the
incantation
of
this
whiteness
and
learned
why
it
appeals
with
such
power
to
the
soul
and
more
strange
and
far
more
portentous—why
as
we
have
seen
it
is
at
once
the
most
meaning
symbol
of
spiritual
things
nay
the
very
veil
of
the
christian’s
deity
and
yet
should
be
as
it
is
the
intensifying
agent
in
things
the
most
appalling
to
mankind
is
it
that
by
its
indefiniteness
it
shadows
forth
the
heartless
voids
and
immensities
of
the
universe
and
thus
stabs
us
from
behind
with
the
thought
of
annihilation
when
beholding
the
white
depths
of
the
milky
way
or
is
it
that
as
in
essence
whiteness
is
not
so
much
a
colour
as
the
visible
absence
of
colour
and
at
the
same
time
the
concrete
of
all
colours
is
it
for
these
reasons
that
there
is
such
a
dumb
blankness
full
of
meaning
in
a
wide
landscape
of
snows—a
colourless
all-colour
of
atheism
from
which
we
shrink
and
when
we
consider
that
other
theory
of
the
natural
philosophers
that
all
other
earthly
hues—every
stately
or
lovely
emblazoning—the
sweet
tinges
of
sunset
skies
and
woods
yea
and
the
gilded
velvets
of
butterflies
and
the
butterfly
cheeks
of
young
girls
all
these
are
but
subtile
deceits
not
actually
inherent
in
substances
but
only
laid
on
from
without
so
that
all
deified
nature
absolutely
paints
like
the
harlot
whose
allurements
cover
nothing
but
the
charnel-house
within
and
when
we
proceed
further
and
consider
that
the
mystical
cosmetic
which
produces
every
one
of
her
hues
the
great
principle
of
light
for
ever
remains
white
or
colorless
in
itself
and
if
operating
without
medium
upon
matter
would
touch
all
objects
even
tulips
and
roses
with
its
own
blank
tinge—pondering
all
this
the
palsied
universe
lies
before
us
a
leper
and
like
wilful
travellers
in

who
refuse
to
wear

and

the
wretched

the

of

to
the

the
chart
had
you
followed
captain
ahab
down
into
his
cabin
after
the
squall
that
took
place
on
the
night
succeeding
that
wild
ratification
of
his
purpose
with
his
crew
you
would
have
seen
him
go
to
a
locker
in
the
transom
and
bringing
out
a
large
wrinkled
roll
of
yellowish
sea
charts
spread
them
before
him
on
his
screwed-down
table
then
seating
himself
before
it
you
would
have
seen
him
intently
study
the
various
lines
and
shadings
which
there
met
his
eye
and
with
slow
but
steady
pencil
trace
additional
courses
over
spaces
that
before
were
blank
at
intervals
he
would
refer
to
piles
of
old
log-books
beside
him
wherein
were
set
down
the
seasons
and
places
in
which
on
various
former
voyages
of
various
ships
sperm
whales
had
been
captured
or
seen
while
thus
employed
the
heavy
pewter
lamp
suspended
in
chains
over
his
head
continually
rocked
with
the
motion
of
the
ship
and
for
ever
threw
shifting
gleams
and
shadows
of
lines
upon
his
wrinkled
brow
till
it
almost
seemed
that
while
he
himself
was
marking
out
lines
and
courses
on
the
wrinkled
charts
some
invisible
pencil
was
also
tracing
lines
and
courses
upon
the
deeply
marked
chart
of
his
forehead
but
it
was
not
this
night
in
particular
that
in
the
solitude
of
his
cabin
ahab
thus
pondered
over
his
charts
almost
every
night
they
were
brought
out
almost
every
night
some
pencil
marks
were
effaced
and
others
were
substituted
for
with
the
charts
of
all
four
oceans
before
him
ahab
was
threading
a
maze
of
currents
and
eddies
with
a
view
to
the
more
certain
accomplishment
of
that
monomaniac
thought
of
his
soul
now
to
any
one
not
fully
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
the
leviathans
it
might
seem
an
absurdly
hopeless
task
thus
to
seek
out
one
solitary
creature
in
the
unhooped
oceans
of
this
planet
but
not
so
did
it
seem
to
ahab
who
knew
the
sets
of
all
tides
and
currents
and
thereby
calculating
the
driftings
of
the
sperm
whale’s
food
and
also
calling
to
mind
the
regular
ascertained
seasons
for
hunting
him
in
particular
latitudes
could
arrive
at
reasonable
surmises
almost
approaching
to
certainties
concerning
the
timeliest
day
to
be
upon
this
or
that
ground
in
search
of
his
prey
so
assured
indeed
is
the
fact
concerning
the
periodicalness
of
the
sperm
whale’s
resorting
to
given
waters
that
many
hunters
believe
that
could
he
be
closely
observed
and
studied
throughout
the
world
were
the
logs
for
one
voyage
of
the
entire
whale
fleet
carefully
collated
then
the
migrations
of
the
sperm
whale
would
be
found
to
correspond
in
invariability
to
those
of
the
herring-shoals
or
the
flights
of
swallows
on
this
hint
attempts
have
been
made
to
construct
elaborate
migratory
charts
of
the
sperm
whale.*
*since
the
above
was
written
the
statement
is
happily
borne
out
by
an
official
circular
issued
by
lieutenant
maury
of
the
national
observatory
washington
april
16th
1851
by
that
circular
it
appears
that
precisely
such
a
chart
is
in
course
of
completion
and
portions
of
it
are
presented
in
the
circular
“this
chart
divides
the
ocean
into
districts
of
five
degrees
of
latitude
by
five
degrees
of
longitude
perpendicularly
through
each
of
which
districts
are
twelve
columns
for
the
twelve
months
and
horizontally
through
each
of
which
districts
are
three
lines
one
to
show
the
number
of
days
that
have
been
spent
in
each
month
in
every
district
and
the
two
others
to
show
the
number
of
days
in
which
whales
sperm
or
right
have
been
seen.”
besides
when
making
a
passage
from
one
feeding-ground
to
another
the
sperm
whales
guided
by
some
infallible
instinct—say
rather
secret
intelligence
from
the
deity—mostly
swim
in
_veins_
as
they
are
called
continuing
their
way
along
a
given
ocean-line
with
such
undeviating
exactitude
that
no
ship
ever
sailed
her
course
by
any
chart
with
one
tithe
of
such
marvellous
precision
though
in
these
cases
the
direction
taken
by
any
one
whale
be
straight
as
a
surveyor’s
parallel
and
though
the
line
of
advance
be
strictly
confined
to
its
own
unavoidable
straight
wake
yet
the
arbitrary
_vein_
in
which
at
these
times
he
is
said
to
swim
generally
embraces
some
few
miles
in
width
more
or
less
as
the
vein
is
presumed
to
expand
or
contract
but
never
exceeds
the
visual
sweep
from
the
whale-ship’s
mast-heads
when
circumspectly
gliding
along
this
magic
zone
the
sum
is
that
at
particular
seasons
within
that
breadth
and
along
that
path
migrating
whales
may
with
great
confidence
be
looked
for
and
hence
not
only
at
substantiated
times
upon
well
known
separate
feeding-grounds
could
ahab
hope
to
encounter
his
prey
but
in
crossing
the
widest
expanses
of
water
between
those
grounds
he
could
by
his
art
so
place
and
time
himself
on
his
way
as
even
then
not
to
be
wholly
without
prospect
of
a
meeting
there
was
a
circumstance
which
at
first
sight
seemed
to
entangle
his
delirious
but
still
methodical
scheme
but
not
so
in
the
reality
perhaps
though
the
gregarious
sperm
whales
have
their
regular
seasons
for
particular
grounds
yet
in
general
you
cannot
conclude
that
the
herds
which
haunted
such
and
such
a
latitude
or
longitude
this
year
say
will
turn
out
to
be
identically
the
same
with
those
that
were
found
there
the
preceding
season
though
there
are
peculiar
and
unquestionable
instances
where
the
contrary
of
this
has
proved
true
in
general
the
same
remark
only
within
a
less
wide
limit
applies
to
the
solitaries
and
hermits
among
the
matured
aged
sperm
whales
so
that
though
moby
dick
had
in
a
former
year
been
seen
for
example
on
what
is
called
the
seychelle
ground
in
the
indian
ocean
or
volcano
bay
on
the
japanese
coast
yet
it
did
not
follow
that
were
the
pequod
to
visit
either
of
those
spots
at
any
subsequent
corresponding
season
she
would
infallibly
encounter
him
there
so
too
with
some
other
feeding
grounds
where
he
had
at
times
revealed
himself
but
all
these
seemed
only
his
casual
stopping-places
and
ocean-inns
so
to
speak
not
his
places
of
prolonged
abode
and
where
ahab’s
chances
of
accomplishing
his
object
have
hitherto
been
spoken
of
allusion
has
only
been
made
to
whatever
way-side
antecedent
extra
prospects
were
his
ere
a
particular
set
time
or
place
were
attained
when
all
possibilities
would
become
probabilities
and
as
ahab
fondly
thought
every
possibility
the
next
thing
to
a
certainty
that
particular
set
time
and
place
were
conjoined
in
the
one
technical
phrase—the
season-on-the-line
for
there
and
then
for
several
consecutive
years
moby
dick
had
been
periodically
descried
lingering
in
those
waters
for
awhile
as
the
sun
in
its
annual
round
loiters
for
a
predicted
interval
in
any
one
sign
of
the
zodiac
there
it
was
too
that
most
of
the
deadly
encounters
with
the
white
whale
had
taken
place
there
the
waves
were
storied
with
his
deeds
there
also
was
that
tragic
spot
where
the
monomaniac
old
man
had
found
the
awful
motive
to
his
vengeance
but
in
the
cautious
comprehensiveness
and
unloitering
vigilance
with
which
ahab
threw
his
brooding
soul
into
this
unfaltering
hunt
he
would
not
permit
himself
to
rest
all
his
hopes
upon
the
one
crowning
fact
above
mentioned
however
flattering
it
might
be
to
those
hopes
nor
in
the
sleeplessness
of
his
vow
could
he
so
tranquillize
his
unquiet
heart
as
to
postpone
all
intervening
quest
now
the
pequod
had
sailed
from
nantucket
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
season-on-the-line
no
possible
endeavor
then
could
enable
her
commander
to
make
the
great
passage
southwards
double
cape
horn
and
then
running
down
sixty
degrees
of
latitude
arrive
in
the
equatorial
pacific
in
time
to
cruise
there
therefore
he
must
wait
for
the
next
ensuing
season
yet
the
premature
hour
of
the
pequod’s
sailing
had
perhaps
been
correctly
selected
by
ahab
with
a
view
to
this
very
complexion
of
things
because
an
interval
of
three
hundred
and
sixty-five
days
and
nights
was
before
him
an
interval
which
instead
of
impatiently
enduring
ashore
he
would
spend
in
a
miscellaneous
hunt
if
by
chance
the
white
whale
spending
his
vacation
in
seas
far
remote
from
his
periodical
feeding-grounds
should
turn
up
his
wrinkled
brow
off
the
persian
gulf
or
in
the
bengal
bay
or
china
seas
or
in
any
other
waters
haunted
by
his
race
so
that
monsoons
pampas
nor’-westers
harmattans
trades
any
wind
but
the
levanter
and
simoon
might
blow
moby
dick
into
the
devious
zig-zag
world-circle
of
the
pequod’s
circumnavigating
wake
but
granting
all
this
yet
regarded
discreetly
and
coolly
seems
it
not
but
a
mad
idea
this
that
in
the
broad
boundless
ocean
one
solitary
whale
even
if
encountered
should
be
thought
capable
of
individual
recognition
from
his
hunter
even
as
a
white-bearded
mufti
in
the
thronged
thoroughfares
of
constantinople
yes
for
the
peculiar
snow-white
brow
of
moby
dick
and
his
snow-white
hump
could
not
but
be
unmistakable
and
have
i
not
tallied
the
whale
ahab
would
mutter
to
himself
as
after
poring
over
his
charts
till
long
after
midnight
he
would
throw
himself
back
in
reveries—tallied
him
and
shall
he
escape
his
broad
fins
are
bored
and
scalloped
out
like
a
lost
sheep’s
ear
and
here
his
mad
mind
would
run
on
in
a
breathless
race
till
a
weariness
and
faintness
of
pondering
came
over
him
and
in
the
open
air
of
the
deck
he
would
seek
to
recover
his
strength
ah
god
what
trances
of
torments
does
that
man
endure
who
is
consumed
with
one
unachieved
revengeful
desire
he
sleeps
with
clenched
hands
and
wakes
with
his
own
bloody
nails
in
his
palms
often
when
forced
from
his
hammock
by
exhausting
and
intolerably
vivid
dreams
of
the
night
which
resuming
his
own
intense
thoughts
through
the
day
carried
them
on
amid
a
clashing
of
phrensies
and
whirled
them
round
and
round
and
round
in
his
blazing
brain
till
the
very
throbbing
of
his
life-spot
became
insufferable
anguish
and
when
as
was
sometimes
the
case
these
spiritual
throes
in
him
heaved
his
being
up
from
its
base
and
a
chasm
seemed
opening
in
him
from
which
forked
flames
and
lightnings
shot
up
and
accursed
fiends
beckoned
him
to
leap
down
among
them
when
this
hell
in
himself
yawned
beneath
him
a
wild
cry
would
be
heard
through
the
ship
and
with
glaring
eyes
ahab
would
burst
from
his
state
room
as
though
escaping
from
a
bed
that
was
on
fire
yet
these
perhaps
instead
of
being
the
unsuppressable
symptoms
of
some
latent
weakness
or
fright
at
his
own
resolve
were
but
the
plainest
tokens
of
its
intensity
for
at
such
times
crazy
ahab
the
scheming
unappeasedly
steadfast
hunter
of
the
white
whale
this
ahab
that
had
gone
to
his
hammock
was
not
the
agent
that
so
caused
him
to
burst
from
it
in
horror
again
the
latter
was
the
eternal
living
principle
or
soul
in
him
and
in
sleep
being
for
the
time
dissociated
from
the
characterizing
mind
which
at
other
times
employed
it
for
its
outer
vehicle
or
agent
it
spontaneously
sought
escape
from
the
scorching
contiguity
of
the
frantic
thing
of
which
for
the
time
it
was
no
longer
an
integral
but
as
the
mind
does
not
exist
unless
leagued
with
the
soul
therefore
it
must
have
been
that
in
ahab’s
case
yielding
up
all
his
thoughts
and
fancies
to
his
one
supreme
purpose
that
purpose
by
its
own
sheer
inveteracy
of
will
forced
itself
against
gods
and
devils
into
a
kind
of
self-assumed
independent
being
of
its
own
nay
could
grimly
live
and
burn
while
the
common
vitality
to
which
it
was
conjoined
fled
horror-stricken
from
the
unbidden
and
unfathered
birth
therefore
the
tormented
spirit
that
glared
out
of
bodily
eyes
when
what
seemed
ahab
rushed
from
his
room
was
for
the
time
but
a
vacated
thing
a
formless
somnambulistic
being
a
ray
of
living
light
to
be
sure
but
without
an
object
to
colour
and
therefore
a
blankness
in
itself
god
help
thee
old
man
thy
thoughts
have
created
a
creature
in
thee
and
he
whose
intense
thinking
thus
makes
him
a
prometheus
a
vulture
feeds
upon
that
heart
for
ever
that
vulture
the
very
creature
he
creates
chapter
45
the
affidavit
so
far
as
what
there
may
be
of
a
narrative
in
this
book
and
indeed
as
indirectly
touching
one
or
two
very
interesting
and
curious
particulars
in
the
habits
of
sperm
whales
the
foregoing
chapter
in
its
earlier
part
is
as
important
a
one
as
will
be
found
in
this
volume
but
the
leading
matter
of
it
requires
to
be
still
further
and
more
familiarly
enlarged
upon
in
order
to
be
adequately
understood
and
moreover
to
take
away
any
incredulity
which
a
profound
ignorance
of
the
entire
subject
may
induce
in
some
minds
as
to
the
natural
verity
of
the
main
points
of
this
affair
i
care
not
to
perform
this
part
of
my
task
methodically
but
shall
be
content
to
produce
the
desired
impression
by
separate
citations
of
items
practically
or
reliably
known
to
me
as
a
whaleman
and
from
these
citations
i
take
it—the
conclusion
aimed
at
will
naturally
follow
of
itself
first
i
have
personally
known
three
instances
where
a
whale
after
receiving
a
harpoon
has
effected
a
complete
escape
and
after
an
interval
in
one
instance
of
three
years
has
been
again
struck
by
the
same
hand
and
slain
when
the
two
irons
both
marked
by
the
same
private
cypher
have
been
taken
from
the
body
in
the
instance
where
three
years
intervened
between
the
flinging
of
the
two
harpoons
and
i
think
it
may
have
been
something
more
than
that
the
man
who
darted
them
happening
in
the
interval
to
go
in
a
trading
ship
on
a
voyage
to
africa
went
ashore
there
joined
a
discovery
party
and
penetrated
far
into
the
interior
where
he
travelled
for
a
period
of
nearly
two
years
often
endangered
by
serpents
savages
tigers
poisonous
miasmas
with
all
the
other
common
perils
incident
to
wandering
in
the
heart
of
unknown
regions
meanwhile
the
whale
he
had
struck
must
also
have
been
on
its
travels
no
doubt
it
had
thrice
circumnavigated
the
globe
brushing
with
its
flanks
all
the
coasts
of
africa
but
to
no
purpose
this
man
and
this
whale
again
came
together
and
the
one
vanquished
the
other
i
say
i
myself
have
known
three
instances
similar
to
this
that
is
in
two
of
them
i
saw
the
whales
struck
and
upon
the
second
attack
saw
the
two
irons
with
the
respective
marks
cut
in
them
afterwards
taken
from
the
dead
fish
in
the
three-year
instance
it
so
fell
out
that
i
was
in
the
boat
both
times
first
and
last
and
the
last
time
distinctly
recognised
a
peculiar
sort
of
huge
mole
under
the
whale’s
eye
which
i
had
observed
there
three
years
previous
i
say
three
years
but
i
am
pretty
sure
it
was
more
than
that
here
are
three
instances
then
which
i
personally
know
the
truth
of
but
i
have
heard
of
many
other
instances
from
persons
whose
veracity
in
the
matter
there
is
no
good
ground
to
impeach
secondly
it
is
well
known
in
the
sperm
whale
fishery
however
ignorant
the
world
ashore
may
be
of
it
that
there
have
been
several
memorable
historical
instances
where
a
particular
whale
in
the
ocean
has
been
at
distant
times
and
places
popularly
cognisable
why
such
a
whale
became
thus
marked
was
not
altogether
and
originally
owing
to
his
bodily
peculiarities
as
distinguished
from
other
whales
for
however
peculiar
in
that
respect
any
chance
whale
may
be
they
soon
put
an
end
to
his
peculiarities
by
killing
him
and
boiling
him
down
into
a
peculiarly
valuable
oil
no
the
reason
was
this
that
from
the
fatal
experiences
of
the
fishery
there
hung
a
terrible
prestige
of
perilousness
about
such
a
whale
as
there
did
about
rinaldo
rinaldini
insomuch
that
most
fishermen
were
content
to
recognise
him
by
merely
touching
their
tarpaulins
when
he
would
be
discovered
lounging
by
them
on
the
sea
without
seeking
to
cultivate
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
like
some
poor
devils
ashore
that
happen
to
know
an
irascible
great
man
they
make
distant
unobtrusive
salutations
to
him
in
the
street
lest
if
they
pursued
the
acquaintance
further
they
might
receive
a
summary
thump
for
their
presumption
but
not
only
did
each
of
these
famous
whales
enjoy
great
individual
celebrity—nay
you
may
call
it
an
ocean-wide
renown
not
only
was
he
famous
in
life
and
now
is
immortal
in
forecastle
stories
after
death
but
he
was
admitted
into
all
the
rights
privileges
and
distinctions
of
a
name
had
as
much
a
name
indeed
as
cambyses
or
cæsar
was
it
not
so
o
timor
tom
thou
famed
leviathan
scarred
like
an
iceberg
who
so
long
did’st
lurk
in
the
oriental
straits
of
that
name
whose
spout
was
oft
seen
from
the
palmy
beach
of
ombay
was
it
not
so
o

zealand
jack
thou
terror
of
all
cruisers
that
crossed
their
wakes
in
the
vicinity
of
the
tattoo
land
was
it
not
so
o

king
of
japan
whose
lofty

they
say
at
times
assumed
the
semblance
of
a
snow-white
cross
against

it
not
so
o

thou

as
well
known
to
the
students
of

history
as

to
the
classic
scholar
but
this
is
not
all
new

at

times
creating

havoc
among

boats
of
different

were
finally
gone
in
quest
of
systematically
hunted
out
chased
and
killed
by
valiant
whaling
captains
who
heaved
up
their
anchors
with
that
express
object
as
much
in
view
as
in
setting
out
through
the
narragansett
woods
captain
butler
of
old
had
it
in
his
mind
to
capture
that
notorious
murderous
savage
annawon
the
headmost
warrior
of
the
indian
king
philip
i
do
not
know
where
i
can
find
a
better
place
than
just
here
to
make
mention
of
one
or
two
other
things
which
to
me
seem
important
as
in
printed
form
establishing
in
all
respects
the
reasonableness
of
the
whole
story
of
the
white
whale
more
especially
the
catastrophe
for
this
is
one
of
those
disheartening
instances
where
truth
requires
full
as
much
bolstering
as
error
so
ignorant
are
most
landsmen
of
some
of
the
plainest
and
most
palpable
wonders
of
the
world
that
without
some
hints
touching
the
plain
facts
historical
and
otherwise
of
the
fishery
they
might
scout
at
moby
dick
as
a
monstrous
fable
or
still
worse
and
more
detestable
a
hideous
and
intolerable
allegory
first
though
most
men
have
some
vague
flitting
ideas
of
the
general
perils
of
the
grand
fishery
yet
they
have
nothing
like
a
fixed
vivid
conception
of
those
perils
and
the
frequency
with
which
they
recur
one
reason
perhaps
is
that
not
one
in
fifty
of
the
actual
disasters
and
deaths
by
casualties
in
the
fishery
ever
finds
a
public
record
at
home
however
transient
and
immediately
forgotten
that
record
do
you
suppose
that
that
poor
fellow
there
who
this
moment
perhaps
caught
by
the
whale-line
off
the
coast
of
new
guinea
is
being
carried
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
by
the
sounding
leviathan—do
you
suppose
that
that
poor
fellow’s
name
will
appear
in
the
newspaper
obituary
you
will
read
to-morrow
at
your
breakfast
no
because
the
mails
are
very
irregular
between
here
and
new
guinea
in
fact
did
you
ever
hear
what
might
be
called
regular
news
direct
or
indirect
from
new
guinea
yet
i
tell
you
that
upon
one
particular
voyage
which
i
made
to
the
pacific
among
many
others
we
spoke
thirty
different
ships
every
one
of
which
had
had
a
death
by
a
whale
some
of
them
more
than
one
and
three
that
had
each
lost
a
boat’s
crew
for
god’s
sake
be
economical
with
your
lamps
and
candles
not
a
gallon
you
burn
but
at
least
one
drop
of
man’s
blood
was
spilled
for
it
secondly
people
ashore
have
indeed
some
indefinite
idea
that
a
whale
is
an
enormous
creature
of
enormous
power
but
i
have
ever
found
that
when
narrating
to
them
some
specific
example
of
this
two-fold
enormousness
they
have
significantly
complimented
me
upon
my
facetiousness
when
i
declare
upon
my
soul
i
had
no
more
idea
of
being
facetious
than
moses
when
he
wrote
the
history
of
the
plagues
of
egypt
but
fortunately
the
special
point
i
here
seek
can
be
established
upon
testimony
entirely
independent
of
my
own
that
point
is
this
the
sperm
whale
is
in
some
cases
sufficiently
powerful
knowing
and
judiciously
malicious
as
with
direct
aforethought
to
stave
in
utterly
destroy
and
sink
a
large
ship
and
what
is
more
the
sperm
whale
_has_
done
it
first
in
the
year
1820
the
ship
essex
captain
pollard
of
nantucket
was
cruising
in
the
pacific
ocean
one
day
she
saw
spouts
lowered
her
boats
and
gave
chase
to
a
shoal
of
sperm
whales
ere
long
several
of
the
whales
were
wounded
when
suddenly
a
very
large
whale
escaping
from
the
boats
issued
from
the
shoal
and
bore
directly
down
upon
the
ship
dashing
his
forehead
against
her
hull
he
so
stove
her
in
that
in
less
than
“ten
minutes”
she
settled
down
and
fell
over
not
a
surviving
plank
of
her
has
been
seen
since
after
the
severest
exposure
part
of
the
crew
reached
the
land
in
their
boats
being
returned
home
at
last
captain
pollard
once
more
sailed
for
the
pacific
in
command
of
another
ship
but
the
gods
shipwrecked
him
again
upon
unknown
rocks
and
breakers
for
the
second
time
his
ship
was
utterly
lost
and
forthwith
forswearing
the
sea
he
has
never
tempted
it
since
at
this
day
captain
pollard
is
a
resident
of
nantucket
i
have
seen
owen
chace
who
was
chief
mate
of
the
essex
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
i
have
read
his
plain
and
faithful
narrative
i
have
conversed
with
his
son
and
all
this
within
a
few
miles
of
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe.*
*the
following
are
extracts
from
chace’s
narrative
“every
fact
seemed
to
warrant
me
in
concluding
that
it
was
anything
but
chance
which
directed
his
operations
he
made
two
several
attacks
upon
the
ship
at
a
short
interval
between
them
both
of
which
according
to
their
direction
were
calculated
to
do
us
the
most
injury
by
being
made
ahead
and
thereby
combining
the
speed
of
the
two
objects
for
the
shock
to
effect
which
the
exact
manœuvres
which
he
made
were
necessary
his
aspect
was
most
horrible
and
such
as
indicated
resentment
and
fury
he
came
directly
from
the
shoal
which
we
had
just
before
entered
and
in
which
we
had
struck
three
of
his
companions
as
if
fired
with
revenge
for
their
sufferings.”
again
“at
all
events
the
whole
circumstances
taken
together
all
happening
before
my
own
eyes
and
producing
at
the
time
impressions
in
my
mind
of
decided
calculating
mischief
on
the
part
of
the
whale
many
of
which
impressions
i
cannot
now
recall
induce
me
to
be
satisfied
that
i
am
correct
in
my
opinion.”
here
are
his
reflections
some
time
after
quitting
the
ship
during
a
black
night
in
an
open
boat
when
almost
despairing
of
reaching
any
hospitable
shore
“the
dark
ocean
and
swelling
waters
were
nothing
the
fears
of
being
swallowed
up
by
some
dreadful
tempest
or
dashed
upon
hidden
rocks
with
all
the
other
ordinary
subjects
of
fearful
contemplation
seemed
scarcely
entitled
to
a
moment’s
thought
the
dismal
looking
wreck
and
_the
horrid
aspect
and
revenge
of
the
whale_
wholly
engrossed
my
reflections
until
day
again
made
its
appearance.”
in
another
place—p
45,—he
speaks
of
“_the
mysterious
and
mortal
attack
of
the
animal_.”
secondly
the
ship
union
also
of
nantucket
was
in
the
year
1807
totally
lost
off
the
azores
by
a
similar
onset
but
the
authentic
particulars
of
this
catastrophe
i
have
never
chanced
to
encounter
though
from
the
whale
hunters
i
have
now
and
then
heard
casual
allusions
to
it
thirdly
some
eighteen
or
twenty
years
ago
commodore
j——
then
commanding
an
american
sloop-of-war
of
the
first
class
happened
to
be
dining
with
a
party
of
whaling
captains
on
board
a
nantucket
ship
in
the
harbor
of
oahu
sandwich
islands
conversation
turning
upon
whales
the
commodore
was
pleased
to
be
sceptical
touching
the
amazing
strength
ascribed
to
them
by
the
professional
gentlemen
present
he
peremptorily
denied
for
example
that
any
whale
could
so
smite
his
stout
sloop-of-war
as
to
cause
her
to
leak
so
much
as
a
thimbleful
very
good
but
there
is
more
coming
some
weeks
after
the
commodore
set
sail
in
this
impregnable
craft
for
valparaiso
but
he
was
stopped
on
the
way
by
a
portly
sperm
whale
that
begged
a
few
moments’
confidential
business
with
him
that
business
consisted
in
fetching
the
commodore’s
craft
such
a
thwack
that
with
all
his
pumps
going
he
made
straight
for
the
nearest
port
to
heave
down
and
repair
i
am
not
superstitious
but
i
consider
the
commodore’s
interview
with
that
whale
as
providential
was
not
saul
of
tarsus
converted
from
unbelief
by
a
similar
fright
i
tell
you
the
sperm
whale
will
stand
no
nonsense
i
will
now
refer
you
to
langsdorff’s
voyages
for
a
little
circumstance
in
point
peculiarly
interesting
to
the
writer
hereof
langsdorff
you
must
know
by
the
way
was
attached
to
the
russian
admiral
krusenstern’s
famous
discovery
expedition
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
captain
langsdorff
thus
begins
his
seventeenth
chapter
“by
the
thirteenth
of
may
our
ship
was
ready
to
sail
and
the
next
day
we
were
out
in
the
open
sea
on
our
way
to
ochotsh
the
weather
was
very
clear
and
fine
but
so
intolerably
cold
that
we
were
obliged
to
keep
on
our
fur
clothing
for
some
days
we
had
very
little
wind
it
was
not
till
the
nineteenth
that
a
brisk
gale
from
the
northwest
sprang
up
an
uncommon
large
whale
the
body
of
which
was
larger
than
the
ship
itself
lay
almost
at
the
surface
of
the
water
but
was
not
perceived
by
any
one
on
board
till
the
moment
when
the
ship
which
was
in
full
sail
was
almost
upon
him
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
its
striking
against
him
we
were
thus
placed
in
the
most
imminent
danger
as
this
gigantic
creature
setting
up
its
back
raised
the
ship
three
feet
at
least
out
of
the
water
the
masts
reeled
and
the
sails
fell
altogether
while
we
who
were
below
all
sprang
instantly
upon
the
deck
concluding
that
we
had
struck
upon
some
rock
instead
of
this
we
saw
the
monster
sailing
off
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
solemnity
captain
d’wolf
applied
immediately
to
the
pumps
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
vessel
had
received
any
damage
from
the
shock
but
we
found
that
very
happily
it
had
escaped
entirely
uninjured.”
now
the
captain
d’wolf
here
alluded
to
as
commanding
the
ship
in
question
is
a
new
englander
who
after
a
long
life
of
unusual
adventures
as
a
sea-captain
this
day
resides
in
the
village
of
dorchester
near
boston
i
have
the
honor
of
being
a
nephew
of
his
i
have
particularly
questioned
him
concerning
this
passage
in
langsdorff
he
substantiates
every
word
the
ship
however
was
by
no
means
a
large
one
a
russian
craft
built
on
the
siberian
coast
and
purchased
by
my
uncle
after
bartering
away
the
vessel
in
which
he
sailed
from
home
in
that
up
and
down
manly
book
of
old-fashioned
adventure
so
full
too
of
honest
wonders—the
voyage
of
lionel
wafer
one
of
ancient
dampier’s
old
chums—i
found
a
little
matter
set
down
so
like
that
just
quoted
from
langsdorff
that
i
cannot
forbear
inserting
it
here
for
a
corroborative
example
if
such
be
needed
lionel
it
seems
was
on
his
way
to
“john
ferdinando,”
as
he
calls
the
modern
juan
fernandes
“in
our
way
thither,”
he
says
“about
four
o’clock
in
the
morning
when
we
were
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
from
the
main
of
america
our
ship
felt
a
terrible
shock
which
put
our
men
in
such
consternation
that
they
could
hardly
tell
where
they
were
or
what
to
think
but
every
one
began
to
prepare
for
death
and
indeed
the
shock
was
so
sudden
and
violent
that
we
took
it
for
granted
the
ship
had
struck
against
a
rock
but
when
the
amazement
was
a
little
over
we
cast
the
lead
and
sounded
but
found
no
ground
*
*
*
*
*
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
made
the
guns
leap
in
their
carriages
and
several
of
the
men
were
shaken
out
of
their
hammocks
captain
davis
who
lay
with
his
head
on
a
gun
was
thrown
out
of
his
cabin!”
lionel
then
goes
on
to
impute
the
shock
to
an
earthquake
and
seems
to
substantiate
the
imputation
by
stating
that
a
great
earthquake
somewhere
about
that
time
did
actually
do
great
mischief
along
the
spanish
land
but
i
should
not
much
wonder
if
in
the
darkness
of
that
early
hour
of
the
morning
the
shock
was
after
all
caused
by
an
unseen
whale
vertically
bumping
the
hull
from
beneath
i
might
proceed
with
several
more
examples
one
way
or
another
known
to
me
of
the
great
power
and
malice
at
times
of
the
sperm
whale
in
more
than
one
instance
he
has
been
known
not
only
to
chase
the
assailing
boats
back
to
their
ships
but
to
pursue
the
ship
itself
and
long
withstand
all
the
lances
hurled
at
him
from
its
decks
the
english
ship
pusie
hall
can
tell
a
story
on
that
head
and
as
for
his
strength
let
me
say
that
there
have
been
examples
where
the
lines
attached
to
a
running
sperm
whale
have
in
a
calm
been
transferred
to
the
ship
and
secured
there
the
whale
towing
her
great
hull
through
the
water
as
a
horse
walks
off
with
a
cart
again
it
is
very
often
observed
that
if
the
sperm
whale
once
struck
is
allowed
time
to
rally
he
then
acts
not
so
often
with
blind
rage
as
with
wilful
deliberate
designs
of
destruction
to
his
pursuers
nor
is
it
without
conveying
some
eloquent
indication
of
his
character
that
upon
being
attacked
he
will
frequently
open
his
mouth
and
retain
it
in
that
dread
expansion
for
several
consecutive
minutes
but
i
must
be
content
with
only
one
more
and
a
concluding
illustration
a
remarkable
and
most
significant
one
by
which
you
will
not
fail
to
see
that
not
only
is
the
most
marvellous
event
in
this
book
corroborated
by
plain
facts
of
the
present
day
but
that
these
marvels
like
all
marvels
are
mere
repetitions
of
the
ages
so
that
for
the
millionth
time
we
say
amen
with
solomon—verily
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
in
the
sixth
christian
century
lived
procopius
a
christian
magistrate
of
constantinople
in
the
days
when
justinian
was
emperor
and
belisarius
general
as
many
know
he
wrote
the
history
of
his
own
times
a
work
every
way
of
uncommon
value
by
the
best
authorities
he
has
always
been
considered
a
most
trustworthy
and
unexaggerating
historian
except
in
some
one
or
two
particulars
not
at
all
affecting
the
matter
presently
to
be
mentioned
now
in
this
history
of
his
procopius
mentions
that
during
the
term
of
his
prefecture
at
constantinople
a
great
sea-monster
was
captured
in
the
neighboring
propontis
or
sea
of
marmora
after
having
destroyed
vessels
at
intervals
in
those
waters
for
a
period
of
more
than
fifty
years
a
fact
thus
set
down
in
substantial
history
cannot
easily
be
gainsaid
nor
is
there
any
reason
it
should
be
of
what
precise
species
this
sea-monster
was
is
not
mentioned
but
as
he
destroyed
ships
as
well
as
for
other
reasons
he
must
have
been
a
whale
and
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
think
a
sperm
whale
and
i
will
tell
you
why
for
a
long
time
i
fancied
that
the
sperm
whale
had
been
always
unknown
in
the
mediterranean
and
the
deep
waters
connecting
with
it
even
now
i
am
certain
that
those
seas
are
not
and
perhaps
never
can
be
in
the
present
constitution
of
things
a
place
for
his
habitual
gregarious
resort
but
further
investigations
have
recently
proved
to
me
that
in
modern
times
there
have
been
isolated
instances
of
the
presence
of
the
sperm
whale
in
the
mediterranean
i
am
told
on
good
authority
that
on
the
barbary
coast
a
commodore
davis
of
the
british
navy
found
the
skeleton
of
a
sperm
whale
now
as
a
vessel
of
war
readily
passes
through
the
dardanelles
hence
a
sperm
whale
could
by
the
same
route
pass
out
of
the
mediterranean
into
the
propontis
in
the
propontis
as
far
as
i
can
learn
none
of
that
peculiar
substance
called
_brit_
is
to
be
found
the
aliment
of
the
right
whale
but
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
food
of
the
sperm
whale—squid
or
cuttle-fish—lurks
at
the
bottom
of
that
sea
because
large
creatures
but
by
no
means
the
largest
of
that
sort
have
been
found
at
its
surface
if
then
you
properly
put
these
statements
together
and
reason
upon
them
a
bit
you
will
clearly
perceive
that
according
to
all
human
reasoning
procopius’s
sea-monster
that
for
half
a
century
stove
the
ships
of
a
roman
emperor
must
in
all
probability
have
been
a
sperm
whale
chapter
46
surmises
though
consumed
with
the
hot
fire
of
his
purpose
ahab
in
all
his
thoughts
and
actions
ever
had
in
view
the
ultimate
capture
of
moby
dick
though
he
seemed
ready
to
sacrifice
all
mortal
interests
to
that
one
passion
nevertheless
it
may
have
been
that
he
was
by
nature
and
long
habituation
far
too
wedded
to
a
fiery
whaleman’s
ways
altogether
to
abandon
the
collateral
prosecution
of
the
voyage
or
at
least
if
this
were
otherwise
there
were
not
wanting
other
motives
much
more
influential
with
him
it
would
be
refining
too
much
perhaps
even
considering
his
monomania
to
hint
that
his
vindictiveness
towards
the
white
whale
might
have
possibly
extended
itself
in
some
degree
to
all
sperm
whales
and
that
the
more
monsters
he
slew
by
so
much
the
more
he
multiplied
the
chances
that
each
subsequently
encountered
whale
would
prove
to
be
the
hated
one
he
hunted
but
if
such
an
hypothesis
be
indeed
exceptionable
there
were
still
additional
considerations
which
though
not
so
strictly
according
with
the
wildness
of
his
ruling
passion
yet
were
by
no
means
incapable
of
swaying
him
to
accomplish
his
object
ahab
must
use
tools
and
of
all
tools
used
in
the
shadow
of
the
moon
men
are
most
apt
to
get
out
of
order
he
knew
for
example
that
however
magnetic
his
ascendency
in
some
respects
was
over
starbuck
yet
that
ascendency
did
not
cover
the
complete
spiritual
man
any
more
than
mere
corporeal
superiority
involves
intellectual
mastership
for
to
the
purely
spiritual
the
intellectual
but
stand
in
a
sort
of
corporeal
relation
starbuck’s
body
and
starbuck’s
coerced
will
were
ahab’s
so
long
as
ahab
kept
his
magnet
at
starbuck’s
brain
still
he
knew
that
for
all
this
the
chief
mate
in
his
soul
abhorred
his
captain’s
quest
and
could
he
would
joyfully
disintegrate
himself
from
it
or
even
frustrate
it
it
might
be
that
a
long
interval
would
elapse
ere
the
white
whale
was
seen
during
that
long
interval
starbuck
would
ever
be
apt
to
fall
into
open
relapses
of
rebellion
against
his
captain’s
leadership
unless
some
ordinary
prudential
circumstantial
influences
were
brought
to
bear
upon
him
not
only
that
but
the
subtle
insanity
of
ahab
respecting
moby
dick
was
noways
more
significantly
manifested
than
in
his
superlative
sense
and
shrewdness
in
foreseeing
that
for
the
present
the
hunt
should
in
some
way
be
stripped
of
that
strange
imaginative
impiousness
which
naturally
invested
it
that
the
full
terror
of
the
voyage
must
be
kept
withdrawn
into
the
obscure
background
for
few
men’s
courage
is
proof
against
protracted
meditation
unrelieved
by
action
that
when
they
stood
their
long
night
watches
his
officers
and
men
must
have
some
nearer
things
to
think
of
than
moby
dick
for
however
eagerly
and
impetuously
the
savage
crew
had
hailed
the
announcement
of
his
quest
yet
all
sailors
of
all
sorts
are
more
or
less
capricious
and
unreliable—they
live
in
the
varying
outer
weather
and
they
inhale
its
fickleness—and
when
retained
for
any
object
remote
and
blank
in
the
pursuit
however
promissory
of
life
and
passion
in
the
end
it
is
above
all
things
requisite
that
temporary
interests
and
employments
should
intervene
and
hold
them
healthily
suspended
for
the
final
dash
nor
was
ahab
unmindful
of
another
thing
in
times
of
strong
emotion
mankind
disdain
all
base
considerations
but
such
times
are
evanescent
the
permanent
constitutional
condition
of
the
manufactured
man
thought
ahab
is
sordidness
granting
that
the
white
whale
fully
incites
the
hearts
of
this
my
savage
crew
and
playing
round
their
savageness
even
breeds
a
certain
generous
knight-errantism
in
them
still
while
for
the
love
of
it
they
give
chase
to
moby
dick
they
must
also
have
food
for
their
more
common
daily
appetites
for
even
the
high
lifted
and
chivalric
crusaders
of
old
times
were
not
content
to
traverse
two
thousand
miles
of
land
to
fight
for
their
holy
sepulchre
without
committing
burglaries
picking
pockets
and
gaining
other
pious
perquisites
by
the
way
had
they
been
strictly
held
to
their
one
final
and
romantic
object—that
final
and
romantic
object
too
many
would
have
turned
from
in
disgust
i
will
not
strip
these
men
thought
ahab
of
all
hopes
of
cash—aye
cash
they
may
scorn
cash
now
but
let
some
months
go
by
and
no
perspective
promise
of
it
to
them
and
then
this
same
quiescent
cash
all
at
once
mutinying
in
them
this
same
cash
would
soon
cashier
ahab
nor
was
there
wanting
still
another
precautionary
motive
more
related
to
ahab
personally
having
impulsively
it
is
probable
and
perhaps
somewhat
prematurely
revealed
the
prime
but
private
purpose
of
the
pequod’s
voyage
ahab
was
now
entirely
conscious
that
in
so
doing
he
had
indirectly
laid
himself
open
to
the
unanswerable
charge
of
usurpation
and
with
perfect
impunity
both
moral
and
legal
his
crew
if
so
disposed
and
to
that
end
competent
could
refuse
all
further
obedience
to
him
and
even
violently
wrest
from
him
the
command
from
even
the
barely
hinted
imputation
of
usurpation
and
the
possible
consequences
of
such
a
suppressed
impression
gaining
ground
ahab
must
of
course
have
been
most
anxious
to
protect
himself
that
protection
could
only
consist
in
his
own
predominating
brain
and
heart
and
hand
backed
by
a
heedful
closely
calculating
attention
to
every
minute
atmospheric
influence
which
it
was
possible
for
his
crew
to
be
subjected
to
for
all
these
reasons
then
and
others
perhaps
too
analytic
to
be
verbally
developed
here
ahab
plainly
saw
that
he
must
still
in
a
good
degree
continue
true
to
the
natural
nominal
purpose
of
the
pequod’s
voyage
observe
all
customary
usages
and
not
only
that
but
force
himself
to
evince
all
his
well
known
passionate
interest
in
the
general
pursuit
of
his
profession
be
all
this
as
it
may
his
voice
was
now
often
heard
hailing
the
three
mast-heads
and
admonishing
them
to
keep
a
bright
look-out
and
not
omit
reporting
even
a
porpoise
this
vigilance
was
not
long
without
reward
chapter
47
the
mat-maker
it
was
a
cloudy
sultry
afternoon
the
seamen
were
lazily
lounging
about
the
decks
or
vacantly
gazing
over
into
the
lead-coloured
waters
queequeg
and
i
were
mildly
employed
weaving
what
is
called
a
sword-mat
for
an
additional
lashing
to
our
boat
so
still
and
subdued
and
yet
somehow
preluding
was
all
the
scene
and
such
an
incantation
of
reverie
lurked
in
the
air
that
each
silent
sailor
seemed
resolved
into
his
own
invisible
self
i
was
the
attendant
or
page
of
queequeg
while
busy
at
the
mat
as
i
kept
passing
and
repassing
the
filling
or
woof
of
marline
between
the
long
yarns
of
the
warp
using
my
own
hand
for
the
shuttle
and
as
queequeg
standing
sideways
ever
and
anon
slid
his
heavy
oaken
sword
between
the
threads
and
idly
looking
off
upon
the
water
carelessly
and
unthinkingly
drove
home
every
yarn
i
say
so
strange
a
dreaminess
did
there
then
reign
all
over
the
ship
and
all
over
the
sea
only
broken
by
the
intermitting
dull
sound
of
the
sword
that
it
seemed
as
if
this
were
the
loom
of
time
and
i
myself
were
a
shuttle
mechanically
weaving
and
weaving
away
at
the
fates
there
lay
the
fixed
threads
of
the
warp
subject
to
but
one
single
ever
returning
unchanging
vibration
and
that
vibration
merely
enough
to
admit
of
the
crosswise
interblending
of
other
threads
with
its
own
this
warp
seemed
necessity
and
here
thought
i
with
my
own
hand
i
ply
my
own
shuttle
and
weave
my
own
destiny
into
these
unalterable
threads
meantime
queequeg’s
impulsive
indifferent
sword
sometimes
hitting
the
woof
slantingly
or
crookedly
or
strongly
or
weakly
as
the
case
might
be
and
by
this
difference
in
the
concluding
blow
producing
a
corresponding
contrast
in
the
final
aspect
of
the
completed
fabric
this
savage’s
sword
thought
i
which
thus
finally
shapes
and
fashions
both
warp
and
woof
this
easy
indifferent
sword
must
be
chance—aye
chance
free
will
and
necessity—nowise
incompatible—all
interweavingly
working
together
the
straight
warp
of
necessity
not
to
be
swerved
from
its
ultimate
course—its
every
alternating
vibration
indeed
only
tending
to
that
free
will
still
free
to
ply
her
shuttle
between
given
threads
and
chance
though
restrained
in
its
play
within
the
right
lines
of
necessity
and
sideways
in
its
motions
directed
by
free
will
though
thus
prescribed
to
by
both
chance
by
turns
rules
either
and
has
the
last
featuring
blow
at
events
thus
we
were
weaving
and
weaving
away
when
i
started
at
a
sound
so
strange
long
drawn
and
musically
wild
and
unearthly
that
the
ball
of
free
will
dropped
from
my
hand
and
i
stood
gazing
up
at
the
clouds
whence
that
voice
dropped
like
a
wing
high
aloft
in
the
cross-trees
was
that
mad
gay-header
tashtego
his
body
was
reaching
eagerly
forward
his
hand
stretched
out
like
a
wand
and
at
brief
sudden
intervals
he
continued
his
cries
to
be
sure
the
same
sound
was
that
very
moment
perhaps
being
heard
all
over
the
seas
from
hundreds
of
whalemen’s
look-outs
perched
as
high
in
the
air
but
from
few
of
those
lungs
could
that
accustomed
old
cry
have
derived
such
a
marvellous
cadence
as
from
tashtego
the
indian’s
as
he
stood
hovering
over
you
half
suspended
in
air
so
wildly
and
eagerly
peering
towards
the
horizon
you
would
have
thought
him
some
prophet
or
seer
beholding
the
shadows
of
fate
and
by
those
wild
cries
announcing
their
coming
“there
she
blows
there
there
there
she
blows
she
blows!”
“where-away?”
“on
the
lee-beam
about
two
miles
off
a
school
of
them!”
instantly
all
was
commotion
the
sperm
whale
blows
as
a
clock
ticks
with
the
same
undeviating
and
reliable
uniformity
and
thereby
whalemen
distinguish
this
fish
from
other
tribes
of
his
genus
“there
go
flukes!”
was
now
the
cry
from
tashtego
and
the
whales
disappeared
“quick
steward!”
cried
ahab
“time
time!”
dough-boy
hurried
below
glanced
at
the
watch
and
reported
the
exact
minute
to
ahab
the
ship
was
now
kept
away
from
the
wind
and
she
went
gently
rolling
before
it
tashtego
reporting
that
the
whales
had
gone
down
heading
to
leeward
we
confidently
looked
to
see
them
again
directly
in
advance
of
our
bows
for
that
singular
craft
at
times
evinced
by
the
sperm
whale
when
sounding
with
his
head
in
one
direction
he
nevertheless
while
concealed
beneath
the
surface
mills
round
and
swiftly
swims
off
in
the
opposite
quarter—this
deceitfulness
of
his
could
not
now
be
in
action
for
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
fish
seen
by
tashtego
had
been
in
any
way
alarmed
or
indeed
knew
at
all
of
our
vicinity
one
of
the
men
selected
for
shipkeepers—that
is
those
not
appointed
to
the
boats

this
time

the

at
the
main-mast

the
sailors
at
the
fore
and

had
come
down
the
line
tubs
were
fixed
in
their
places
the
cranes
were
thrust
out
the
mainyard
was
backed
and
the
three
boats
swung
over
the
sea
like
three
samphire
baskets
over
high
cliffs
outside
of
the
bulwarks
their
eager
crews
with
one
hand
clung
to
the
rail
while
one
foot
was
expectantly
poised
on
the
gunwale
so
look
the
long
line
of
man-of-war’s
men
about
to
throw
themselves
on
board
an
enemy’s
ship
but
at
this
critical
instant
a
sudden
exclamation
was
heard
that
took
every
eye
from
the
whale
with
a
start
all
glared
at
dark
ahab
who
was
surrounded
by
five
dusky
phantoms
that
seemed
fresh
formed
out
of
air
chapter
48
the
first
lowering
the
phantoms
for
so
they
then
seemed
were
flitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
deck
and
with
a
noiseless
celerity
were
casting
loose
the
tackles
and
bands
of
the
boat
which
swung
there
this
boat
had
always
been
deemed
one
of
the
spare
boats
though
technically
called
the
captain’s
on
account
of
its
hanging
from
the
starboard
quarter
the
figure
that
now
stood
by
its
bows
was
tall
and
swart
with
one
white
tooth
evilly
protruding
from
its
steel-like
lips
a
rumpled
chinese
jacket
of
black
cotton
funereally
invested
him
with
wide
black
trowsers
of
the
same
dark
stuff
but
strangely
crowning
this
ebonness
was
a
glistening
white
plaited
turban
the
living
hair
braided
and
coiled
round
and
round
upon
his
head
less
swart
in
aspect
the
companions
of
this
figure
were
of
that
vivid
tiger-yellow
complexion
peculiar
to
some
of
the
aboriginal
natives
of
the
manillas;—a
race
notorious
for
a
certain
diabolism
of
subtilty
and
by
some
honest
white
mariners
supposed
to
be
the
paid
spies
and
secret
confidential
agents
on
the
water
of
the
devil
their
lord
whose
counting-room
they
suppose
to
be
elsewhere
while
yet
the
wondering
ship’s
company
were
gazing
upon
these
strangers
ahab
cried
out
to
the
white-turbaned
old
man
at
their
head
“all
ready
there
fedallah?”
“ready,”
was
the
half-hissed
reply
“lower
away
then
d’ye
hear?”
shouting
across
the
deck
“lower
away
there
i
say.”
such
was
the
thunder
of
his
voice
that
spite
of
their
amazement
the
men
sprang
over
the
rail
the
sheaves
whirled
round
in
the
blocks
with
a
wallow
the
three
boats
dropped
into
the
sea
while
with
a
dexterous
off-handed
daring
unknown
in
any
other
vocation
the
sailors
goat-like
leaped
down
the
rolling
ship’s
side
into
the
tossed
boats
below
hardly
had
they
pulled
out
from
under
the
ship’s
lee
when
a
fourth
keel
coming
from
the
windward
side
pulled
round
under
the
stern
and
showed
the
five
strangers
rowing
ahab
who
standing
erect
in
the
stern
loudly
hailed
starbuck
stubb
and
flask
to
spread
themselves
widely
so
as
to
cover
a
large
expanse
of
water
but
with
all
their
eyes
again
riveted
upon
the
swart
fedallah
and
his
crew
the
inmates
of
the
other
boats
obeyed
not
the
command
“captain
ahab?—”
said
starbuck
“spread
yourselves,”
cried
ahab
“give
way
all
four
boats
thou
flask
pull
out
more
to
leeward!”
“aye
aye
sir,”
cheerily
cried
little
king-post
sweeping
round
his
great
steering
oar
“lay
back!”
addressing
his
crew
“there!—there!—there
again
there
she
blows
right
ahead
boys!—lay
back!”
“never
heed
yonder
yellow
boys
archy.”
“oh
i
don’t
mind
’em
sir,”
said
archy
“i
knew
it
all
before
now
didn’t
i
hear
’em
in
the
hold
and
didn’t
i
tell
cabaco
here
of
it
what
say
ye
cabaco
they
are
stowaways
mr
flask.”
“pull
pull
my
fine
hearts-alive
pull
my
children
pull
my
little
ones,”
drawlingly
and
soothingly
sighed
stubb
to
his
crew
some
of
whom
still
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
“why
don’t
you
break
your
backbones
my
boys
what
is
it
you
stare
at
those
chaps
in
yonder

tut
they
are
only
five
more
hands

to
help
us—never
mind
from
where—the
more
the
merrier
pull
then
do
pull
never
mind
the
brimstone—devils
are
good
fellows
enough
so
so
there
you
are
now
that’s
the
stroke
for
a
thousand
pounds
that’s
the
stroke
to
sweep
the
stakes
hurrah
for
the
gold
cup
of

my
heroes
three
cheers
men—all
hearts
alive
easy
easy
don’t
be
in
a
hurry—don’t
be
in
a
hurry
why
don’t
you
snap
your
oars
you
rascals
bite
something
you
dogs
so
so
so
then:—softly
softly
that’s
it—that’s
it
long
and
strong
give

there
give

ye
why
in
the
name
of
gudgeons
and
ginger-cakes
don’t
ye
pull?—pull
and
break
something
pull
and
start
your
eyes
out
here!”
whipping
out
the
sharp
knife
from
his
girdle
“every
mother’s
son
of
ye
draw
his
knife
and
pull
with
the
blade
between
his
teeth
that’s
it—that’s
it
now
ye

that

my

start

stubb’s
exordium
to
his
crew
is
given
here
at
large
because
he
had
rather
a
peculiar
way
of
talking
to
them
in
general
and
especially
in
inculcating
the
religion
of
rowing
but
you
must
not
suppose
from
this
specimen
of
his
sermonizings
that
he
ever
flew
into
downright
passions
with
his
congregation
not
at
all
and
therein
consisted
his
chief
peculiarity
he
would
say
the
most
terrific
things
to
his
crew
in
a
tone
so
strangely
compounded
of
fun
and
fury
and
the
fury
seemed
so
calculated
merely
as
a
spice
to
the
fun
that
no
oarsman
could
hear
such
queer
invocations
without
pulling
for
dear
life
and
yet
pulling
for
the
mere
joke
of
the
thing
besides
he
all
the
time
looked
so
easy
and
indolent
himself
so
loungingly
managed
his
steering-oar
and
so
broadly
gaped—open-mouthed
at
times—that
the
mere
sight
of
such
a
yawning
commander
by
sheer
force
of
contrast
acted
like
a
charm
upon
the
crew
then
again
stubb
was
one
of
those
odd
sort
of
humorists
whose
jollity
is
sometimes
so
curiously
ambiguous
as
to
put
all
inferiors
on
their
guard
in
the
matter
of
obeying
them
in
obedience
to
a
sign
from
ahab
starbuck
was
now
pulling
obliquely
across
stubb’s
bow
and
when
for
a
minute
or
so
the
two
boats
were
pretty
near
to
each
other
stubb
hailed
the
mate
“mr
starbuck
larboard
boat
there
ahoy
a
word
with
ye
sir
if
ye
please!”
“halloa!”
returned
starbuck
turning
round
not
a
single
inch
as
he
spoke
still
earnestly
but
whisperingly
urging
his
crew
his
face
set
like
a
flint
from
stubb’s
“what
think
ye
of
those
yellow
boys
sir!”
“smuggled
on
board
somehow
before
the
ship
sailed
strong
strong
boys!)”
in
a
whisper
to
his
crew
then
speaking
out
loud
again
“a
sad
business
mr
stubb
seethe
her
seethe
her
my
lads
but
never
mind
mr
stubb
all
for
the
best
let
all
your
crew
pull
strong
come
what
will
spring
my
men
spring
there’s
hogsheads
of
sperm
ahead
mr
stubb
and
that’s
what
ye
came
for
pull
my
boys
sperm
sperm’s
the
play
this
at
least
is
duty
duty
and
profit
hand
in
hand.”
“aye
aye
i
thought
as
much,”
soliloquized
stubb
when
the
boats
diverged
“as
soon
as
i
clapt
eye
on
’em
i
thought
so
aye
and
that’s
what
he
went
into
the
after
hold
for
so
often
as
dough-boy
long
suspected
they
were
hidden
down
there
the
white
whale’s
at
the
bottom
of
it
well
well
so
be
it
can’t
be
helped
all
right
give
way
men
it
ain’t
the
white
whale
to-day
give
way!”
now
the
advent
of
these
outlandish
strangers
at
such
a
critical
instant
as
the
lowering
of
the
boats
from
the
deck
this
had
not
unreasonably
awakened
a
sort
of
superstitious
amazement
in
some
of
the
ship’s
company
but
archy’s
fancied
discovery
having
some
time
previous
got
abroad
among
them
though
indeed
not
credited
then
this
had
in
some
small
measure
prepared
them
for
the
event
it
took
off
the
extreme
edge
of
their
wonder
and
so
what
with
all
this
and
stubb’s
confident
way
of
accounting
for
their
appearance
they
were
for
the
time
freed
from
superstitious
surmisings
though
the
affair
still
left
abundant
room
for
all
manner
of
wild
conjectures
as
to
dark
ahab’s
precise
agency
in
the
matter
from
the
beginning
for
me
i
silently
recalled
the
mysterious
shadows
i
had
seen
creeping
on
board
the
pequod
during
the
dim
nantucket
dawn
as
well
as
the
enigmatical
hintings
of
the
unaccountable
elijah
meantime
ahab
out
of
hearing
of
his
officers
having
sided
the
furthest
to
windward
was
still
ranging
ahead
of
the
other
boats
a
circumstance
bespeaking
how
potent
a
crew
was
pulling
him
those
tiger
yellow
creatures
of
his
seemed
all
steel
and
whalebone
like
five
trip-hammers
they
rose
and
fell
with
regular
strokes
of
strength
which
periodically
started
the
boat
along
the
water
like
a
horizontal
burst
boiler
out
of
a
mississippi
steamer
as
for
fedallah
who
was
seen
pulling
the
harpooneer
oar
he
had
thrown
aside
his
black
jacket
and
displayed
his
naked
chest
with
the
whole
part
of
his
body
above
the
gunwale
clearly
cut
against
the
alternating
depressions
of
the
watery
horizon
while
at
the
other
end
of
the
boat
ahab
with
one
arm
like
a
fencer’s
thrown
half
backward
into
the
air
as
if
to
counterbalance
any
tendency
to
trip
ahab
was
seen
steadily
managing
his
steering
oar
as
in
a
thousand
boat
lowerings
ere
the
white
whale
had
torn
him
all
at
once
the
outstretched
arm
gave
a
peculiar
motion
and
then
remained
fixed
while
the
boat’s
five
oars
were
seen
simultaneously
peaked
boat
and
crew
sat
motionless
on
the
sea
instantly
the
three
spread
boats
in
the
rear
paused
on
their
way
the
whales
had
irregularly
settled
bodily
down
into
the
blue
thus
giving
no
distantly
discernible
token
of
the
movement
though
from
his
closer
vicinity
ahab
had
observed
it
“every
man
look
out
along
his
oars!”
cried
starbuck
“thou
queequeg
stand
up!”
nimbly
springing
up
on
the
triangular
raised
box
in
the
bow
the
savage
stood
erect
there
and
with
intensely
eager
eyes
gazed
off
towards
the
spot
where
the
chase
had
last
been
descried
likewise
upon
the
extreme
stern
of
the
boat
where
it
was
also
triangularly
platformed
level
with
the
gunwale
starbuck
himself
was
seen
coolly
and
adroitly
balancing
himself
to
the
jerking
tossings
of
his
chip
of
a
craft
and
silently
eyeing
the
vast
blue
eye
of
the
sea
not
very
far
distant
flask’s
boat
was
also
lying
breathlessly
still
its
commander
recklessly
standing
upon
the
top
of
the
loggerhead
a
stout
sort
of
post
rooted
in
the
keel
and
rising
some
two
feet
above
the
level
of
the
stern
platform
it
is
used
for
catching
turns
with
the
whale
line
its
top
is
not
more
spacious
than
the
palm
of
a
man’s
hand
and
standing
upon
such
a
base
as
that
flask
seemed
perched
at
the
mast-head
of
some
ship
which
had
sunk
to
all
but
her
trucks
but
little
king-post
was
small
and
short
and
at
the
same
time
little
king-post
was
full
of
a
large
and
tall
ambition
so
that
this
loggerhead
stand-point
of
his
did
by
no
means
satisfy
king-post
“i
can’t
see
three
seas
off
tip
us
up
an
oar
there
and
let
me
on
to
that.”
upon
this
daggoo
with
either
hand
upon
the
gunwale
to
steady
his
way
swiftly
slid
aft
and
then
erecting
himself
volunteered
his
lofty
shoulders
for
a
pedestal
“good
a
mast-head
as
any
sir
will
you
mount?”
“that
i
will
and
thank
ye
very
much
my
fine
fellow
only
i
wish
you
fifty
feet
taller.”
whereupon
planting
his
feet
firmly
against
two
opposite
planks
of
the
boat
the
gigantic
negro
stooping
a
little
presented
his
flat
palm
to
flask’s
foot
and
then
putting
flask’s
hand
on
his
hearse-plumed
head
and
bidding
him
spring
as
he
himself
should
toss
with
one
dexterous
fling
landed
the
little
man
high
and
dry
on
his
shoulders
and
here
was
flask
now
standing
daggoo
with
one
lifted
arm
furnishing
him
with
a
breastband
to
lean
against
and
steady
himself
by
at
any
time
it
is
a
strange
sight
to
the
tyro
to
see
with
what
wondrous
habitude
of
unconscious
skill
the
whaleman
will
maintain
an
erect
posture
in
his
boat
even
when
pitched
about
by
the
most
riotously
perverse
and
cross-running
seas
still
more
strange
to
see
him
giddily
perched
upon
the
loggerhead
itself
under
such
circumstances
but
the
sight
of
little
flask
mounted
upon
gigantic
daggoo
was
yet
more
curious
for
sustaining
himself
with
a
cool
indifferent
easy
unthought
of
barbaric
majesty
the
noble
negro
to
every
roll
of
the
sea
harmoniously
rolled
his
fine
form
on
his
broad
back
flaxen-haired
flask
seemed
a
snow-flake
the
bearer
looked
nobler
than
the
rider
though
truly
vivacious
tumultuous
ostentatious
little
flask
would
now
and
then
stamp
with
impatience
but
not
one
added
heave
did
he
thereby
give
to
the
negro’s
lordly
chest
so
have
i
seen
passion
and
vanity
stamping
the
living
magnanimous
earth
but
the
earth
did
not
alter
her
tides
and
her
seasons
for
that
meanwhile
stubb
the
third
mate
betrayed
no
such
far-gazing
solicitudes
the
whales
might
have
made
one
of
their
regular
soundings
not
a
temporary
dive
from
mere
fright
and
if
that
were
the
case
stubb
as
his
wont
in
such
cases
it
seems
was
resolved
to
solace
the
languishing
interval
with
his
pipe
he
withdrew
it
from
his
hatband
where
he
always
wore
it
aslant
like
a
feather
he
loaded
it
and
rammed
home
the
loading
with
his
thumb-end
but
hardly
had
he
ignited
his
match
across
the
rough
sandpaper
of
his
hand
when
tashtego
his
harpooneer
whose
eyes
had
been
setting
to
windward
like
two
fixed
stars
suddenly
dropped
like
light
from
his
erect
attitude
to
his
seat
crying
out
in
a
quick
phrensy
of
hurry
“down
down
all
and
give
way!—there
they
are!”
to
a
landsman
no
whale
nor
any
sign
of
a
herring
would
have
been
visible
at
that
moment
nothing
but
a
troubled
bit
of
greenish
white
water
and
thin
scattered
puffs
of
vapor
hovering
over
it
and
suffusingly
blowing
off
to
leeward
like
the
confused
scud
from
white
rolling
billows
the
air
around
suddenly
vibrated
and
tingled
as
it
were
like
the
air
over
intensely
heated
plates
of
iron
beneath
this
atmospheric
waving
and
curling
and
partially
beneath
a
thin
layer
of
water
also
the
whales
were
swimming
seen
in
advance
of
all
the
other
indications
the
puffs
of
vapor
they
spouted
seemed
their
forerunning
couriers
and
detached
flying
outriders
all
four
boats
were
now
in
keen
pursuit
of
that
one
spot
of
troubled
water
and
air
but
it
bade
fair
to
outstrip
them
it
flew
on
and
on
as
a
mass
of
interblending
bubbles
borne
down
a
rapid
stream
from
the
hills
“pull
pull
my
good
boys,”
said
starbuck
in
the
lowest
possible
but
intensest
concentrated
whisper
to
his
men
while
the
sharp
fixed
glance
from
his
eyes
darted
straight
ahead
of
the
bow
almost
seemed
as
two
visible
needles
in
two
unerring
binnacle
compasses
he
did
not
say
much
to
his
crew
though
nor
did
his
crew
say
anything
to
him
only
the
silence
of
the
boat
was
at
intervals
startlingly
pierced
by
one
of
his
peculiar
whispers
now
harsh
with
command
now
soft
with
entreaty
how
different
the
loud
little
king-post
“sing
out
and
say
something
my
hearties
roar
and
pull
my
thunderbolts
beach
me
beach
me
on
their
black
backs
boys
only
do
that
for
me
and
i’ll
sign
over
to
you
my
martha’s
vineyard
plantation
boys
including
wife
and
children
boys
lay
me
on—lay
me
on
o
lord
lord
but
i
shall
go
stark
staring
mad
see
see
that
white
water!”
and
so
shouting
he
pulled
his
hat
from
his
head
and
stamped
up
and
down
on
it
then
picking
it
up
flirted
it
far
off
upon
the
sea
and
finally
fell
to
rearing
and
plunging
in
the
boat’s
stern
like
a
crazed
colt
from
the
prairie
“look
at
that
chap
now,”
philosophically
drawled
stubb
who
with
his
unlighted
short
pipe
mechanically
retained
between
his
teeth
at
a
short
distance
followed
after—“he’s
got
fits
that
flask
has
fits
yes
give
him
fits—that’s
the
very
word—pitch
fits
into
’em
merrily
merrily
hearts-alive
pudding
for
supper
you
know;—merry’s
the
word
pull
babes—pull
sucklings—pull
all
but
what
the
devil
are
you
hurrying
about
softly
softly
and
steadily
my
men
only
pull
and
keep
pulling
nothing
more
crack
all
your
backbones
and
bite
your
knives
in
two—that’s
all
take
it
easy—why
don’t
ye
take
it
easy
i
say
and
burst
all
your
livers
and
lungs!”
but
what
it
was
that
inscrutable
ahab
said
to
that
tiger-yellow
crew
of
his—these
were
words
best
omitted
here
for
you
live
under
the
blessed
light
of
the
evangelical
land
only
the
infidel
sharks
in
the
audacious
seas
may
give
ear
to
such
words
when
with
tornado
brow
and
eyes
of
red
murder
and
foam-glued
lips
ahab
leaped
after
his
prey
meanwhile
all
the
boats
tore
on
the
repeated
specific
allusions
of
flask
to
“that
whale,”
as
he
called
the
fictitious
monster
which
he
declared
to
be
incessantly
tantalizing
his
boat’s
bow
with
its
tail—these
allusions
of
his
were
at
times
so
vivid
and
life-like
that
they
would
cause
some
one
or
two
of
his
men
to
snatch
a
fearful
look
over
the
shoulder
but
this
was
against
all
rule
for
the
oarsmen
must
put
out
their
eyes
and
ram
a
skewer
through
their
necks
usage
pronouncing
that
they
must
have
no
organs
but
ears
and
no
limbs
but
arms
in
these
critical
moments
it
was
a
sight
full
of
quick
wonder
and
awe
the
vast
swells
of
the
omnipotent
sea
the
surging
hollow
roar
they
made
as
they
rolled
along
the
eight
gunwales
like
gigantic
bowls
in
a
boundless
bowling-green
the
brief
suspended
agony
of
the
boat
as
it
would
tip
for
an
instant
on
the
knife-like
edge
of
the
sharper
waves
that
almost
seemed
threatening
to
cut
it
in
two
the
sudden
profound
dip
into
the
watery
glens
and
hollows
the
keen
spurrings
and
goadings
to
gain
the
top
of
the
opposite
hill
the
headlong
sled-like
slide
down
its
other
side;—all
these
with
the
cries
of
the
headsmen
and
harpooneers
and
the
shuddering
gasps
of
the
oarsmen
with
the
wondrous
sight
of
the
ivory
pequod
bearing
down
upon
her
boats
with
outstretched
sails
like
a
wild
hen
after
her
screaming
brood;—all
this
was
thrilling
not
the
raw
recruit
marching
from
the
bosom
of
his
wife
into
the
fever
heat
of
his
first
battle
not
the
dead
man’s
ghost
encountering
the
first
unknown
phantom
in
the
other
world;—neither
of
these
can
feel
stranger
and
stronger
emotions
than
that
man
does
who
for
the
first
time
finds
himself
pulling
into
the
charmed
churned
circle
of
the
hunted
sperm
whale
the
dancing
white
water
made
by
the
chase
was
now
becoming
more
and
more
visible
owing
to
the
increasing
darkness
of
the
dun
cloud-shadows
flung
upon
the
sea
the
jets
of
vapor
no
longer
blended
but
tilted
everywhere
to
right
and
left
the
whales
seemed
separating
their
wakes
the
boats
were
pulled
more
apart
starbuck
giving
chase
to
three
whales
running
dead
to
leeward
our
sail
was
now
set
and
with
the
still
rising
wind
we
rushed
along
the
boat
going
with
such
madness
through
the
water
that
the
lee
oars
could
scarcely
be
worked
rapidly
enough
to
escape
being
torn
from
the
row-locks
soon
we
were
running
through
a
suffusing
wide
veil
of
mist
neither
ship
nor
boat
to
be
seen
“give
way
men,”
whispered
starbuck
drawing
still
further
aft
the
sheet
of
his
sail
“there
is
time
to
kill
a
fish
yet
before
the
squall
comes
there’s
white
water
again!—close
to
spring!”
soon
after
two
cries
in
quick
succession
on
each
side
of
us
denoted
that
the
other
boats
had
got
fast
but
hardly
were
they
overheard
when
with
a
lightning-like
hurtling
whisper
starbuck
said
“stand
up!”
and
queequeg
harpoon
in
hand
sprang
to
his
feet
though
not
one
of
the
oarsmen
was
then
facing
the
life
and
death
peril
so
close
to
them
ahead
yet
with
their
eyes
on
the
intense
countenance
of
the
mate
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
they
knew
that
the
imminent
instant
had
come
they
heard
too
an
enormous
wallowing
sound
as
of
fifty
elephants
stirring
in
their
litter
meanwhile
the
boat
was
still
booming
through
the
mist
the
waves
curling
and
hissing
around
us
like
the
erected
crests
of
enraged
serpents
“that’s
his
hump
_there_
_there_
give
it
to
him!”
whispered
starbuck
a
short
rushing
sound
leaped
out
of
the
boat
it
was
the
darted
iron
of
queequeg
then
all
in
one
welded
commotion
came
an
invisible
push
from
astern
while
forward
the
boat
seemed
striking
on
a
ledge
the
sail
collapsed
and
exploded
a
gush
of
scalding
vapor
shot
up
near
by
something
rolled
and
tumbled
like
an
earthquake
beneath
us
the
whole
crew
were
half
suffocated
as
they
were
tossed
helter-skelter
into
the
white
curdling
cream
of
the
squall
squall
whale
and
harpoon
had
all
blended
together
and
the
whale
merely
grazed
by
the
iron
escaped
though
completely
swamped
the
boat
was
nearly
unharmed
swimming
round
it
we
picked
up
the
floating
oars
and
lashing
them
across
the
gunwale
tumbled
back
to
our
places
there
we
sat
up
to
our
knees
in
the
sea
the
water
covering
every
rib
and
plank
so
that
to
our
downward
gazing
eyes
the
suspended
craft
seemed
a
coral
boat
grown
up
to
us
from
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
the
wind
increased
to
a
howl
the
waves
dashed
their
bucklers
together
the
whole
squall
roared
forked
and
crackled
around
us
like
a
white
fire
upon
the
prairie
in
which
unconsumed
we
were
burning
immortal
in
these
jaws
of
death
in
vain
we
hailed
the
other
boats
as
well
roar
to
the
live
coals
down
the
chimney
of
a
flaming
furnace
as
hail
those
boats
in
that
storm
meanwhile
the
driving
scud
rack
and
mist
grew
darker
with
the
shadows
of
night
no
sign
of
the
ship
could
be
seen
the
rising
sea
forbade
all
attempts
to
bale
out
the
boat
the
oars
were
useless
as
propellers
performing
now
the
office
of
life-preservers
so
cutting
the
lashing
of
the
waterproof
match
keg
after
many
failures
starbuck
contrived
to
ignite
the
lamp
in
the
lantern
then
stretching
it
on
a
waif
pole
handed
it
to
queequeg
as
the
standard-bearer
of
this
forlorn
hope
there
then
he
sat
holding
up
that
imbecile
candle
in
the
heart
of
that
almighty
forlornness
there
then
he
sat
the
sign
and
symbol
of
a
man
without
faith
hopelessly
holding
up
hope
in
the
midst
of
despair
wet
drenched
through
and
shivering
cold
despairing
of
ship
or
boat
we
lifted
up
our
eyes
as
the
dawn
came
on
the
mist
still
spread
over
the
sea
the
empty
lantern
lay
crushed
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
suddenly
queequeg
started
to
his
feet
hollowing
his
hand
to
his
ear
we
all
heard
a
faint
creaking
as
of
ropes
and
yards
hitherto
muffled
by
the
storm
the
sound
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
thick
mists
were
dimly
parted
by
a
huge
vague
form
affrighted
we
all
sprang
into
the
sea
as
the
ship
at
last
loomed
into
view
bearing
right
down
upon
us
within
a
distance
of
not
much
more
than
its
length
floating
on
the
waves
we
saw
the
abandoned
boat
as
for
one
instant
it
tossed
and
gaped
beneath
the
ship’s
bows
like
a
chip
at
the
base
of
a
cataract
and
then
the
vast
hull
rolled
over
it
and
it
was
seen
no
more
till
it
came
up
weltering
astern
again
we
swam
for
it
were
dashed
against
it
by
the
seas
and
were
at
last
taken
up
and
safely
landed
on
board
ere
the
squall
came
close
to
the
other
boats
had
cut
loose
from
their
fish
and
returned
to
the
ship
in
good
time
the
ship
had
given
us
up
but
was
still
cruising
if
haply
it
might
light
upon
some
token
of
our
perishing,—an
oar
or
a
lance
pole
chapter
49
the
hyena
there
are
certain
queer
times
and
occasions
in
this
strange
mixed
affair
we
call
life
when
a
man
takes
this
whole
universe
for
a
vast
practical
joke
though
the
wit
thereof
he
but
dimly
discerns
and
more
than
suspects
that
the
joke
is
at
nobody’s
expense
but
his
own
however
nothing
dispirits
and
nothing
seems
worth
while
disputing
he
bolts
down
all
events
all
creeds
and
beliefs
and
persuasions
all
hard
things
visible
and
invisible
never
mind
how
knobby
as
an
ostrich
of
potent
digestion
gobbles
down
bullets
and
gun
flints
and
as
for
small
difficulties
and
worryings
prospects
of
sudden
disaster
peril
of
life
and
limb
all
these
and
death
itself
seem
to
him
only
sly
good-natured
hits
and
jolly
punches
in
the
side
bestowed
by
the
unseen
and
unaccountable
old
joker
that
odd
sort
of
wayward
mood
i
am
speaking
of
comes
over
a
man
only
in
some
time
of
extreme
tribulation
it
comes
in
the
very
midst
of
his
earnestness
so
that
what
just
before
might
have
seemed
to
him
a
thing
most
momentous
now
seems
but
a
part
of
the
general
joke
there
is
nothing
like
the
perils
of
whaling
to
breed
this
free
and
easy
sort
of
genial
desperado
philosophy
and
with
it
i
now
regarded
this
whole
voyage
of
the
pequod
and
the
great
white
whale
its
object
“queequeg,”
said
i
when
they
had
dragged
me
the
last
man
to
the
deck
and
i
was
still
shaking
myself
in
my
jacket
to
fling
off
the
water
“queequeg
my
fine
friend
does
this
sort
of
thing
often
happen?”
without
much
emotion
though
soaked
through
just
like
me
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
such
things
did
often
happen
“mr
stubb,”
said
i
turning
to
that
worthy
who
buttoned
up
in
his
oil-jacket
was
now
calmly
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
rain
“mr
stubb
i
think
i
have
heard
you
say
that
of
all
whalemen
you
ever
met
our
chief
mate
mr
starbuck
is
by
far
the
most
careful
and
prudent
i
suppose
then
that
going
plump
on
a
flying
whale
with
your
sail
set
in
a
foggy
squall
is
the
height
of
a
whaleman’s
discretion?”
“certain
i’ve
lowered
for
whales
from
a
leaking
ship
in
a
gale
off
cape
horn.”
“mr
flask,”
said
i
turning
to
little
king-post
who
was
standing
close
by
“you
are
experienced
in
these
things
and
i
am
not
will
you
tell
me
whether
it
is
an
unalterable
law
in
this
fishery
mr
flask
for
an
oarsman
to
break
his
own
back
pulling
himself
back-foremost
into
death’s
jaws?”
“can’t
you
twist
that
smaller?”
said
flask
“yes
that’s
the
law
i
should
like
to
see
a
boat’s
crew
backing
water
up
to
a
whale
face
foremost
ha
ha
the
whale
would
give
them
squint
for
squint
mind
that!”
here
then
from
three
impartial
witnesses
i
had
a
deliberate
statement
of
the
entire
case
considering
therefore
that
squalls
and
capsizings
in
the
water
and
consequent
bivouacks
on
the
deep
were
matters
of
common
occurrence
in
this
kind
of
life
considering
that
at
the
superlatively
critical
instant
of
going
on
to
the
whale
i
must
resign
my
life
into
the
hands
of
him
who
steered
the
boat—oftentimes
a
fellow
who
at
that
very
moment
is
in
his
impetuousness
upon
the
point
of
scuttling
the
craft
with
his
own
frantic
stampings
considering
that
the
particular
disaster
to
our
own
particular
boat
was
chiefly
to
be
imputed
to
starbuck’s
driving
on
to
his
whale
almost
in
the
teeth
of
a
squall
and
considering
that
starbuck
notwithstanding
was
famous
for
his
great
heedfulness
in
the
fishery
considering
that
i
belonged
to
this
uncommonly
prudent
starbuck’s
boat
and
finally
considering
in
what
a
devil’s
chase
i
was
implicated
touching
the
white
whale
taking
all
things
together
i
say
i
thought
i
might
as
well
go
below
and
make
a
rough
draft
of
my
will
“queequeg,”
said
i
“come
along
you
shall
be
my
lawyer
executor
and
legatee.”
it
may
seem
strange
that
of
all
men
sailors
should
be
tinkering
at
their
last
wills
and
testaments
but
there
are
no
people
in
the
world
more
fond
of
that
diversion
this
was
the
fourth
time
in
my
nautical
life
that
i
had
done
the
same
thing
after
the
ceremony
was
concluded
upon
the
present
occasion
i
felt
all
the
easier
a
stone
was
rolled
away
from
my
heart
besides
all
the
days
i
should
now
live
would
be
as
good
as
the
days
that
lazarus
lived
after
his
resurrection
a
supplementary
clean
gain
of
so
many
months
or
weeks
as
the
case
might
be
i

myself
my
death
and
burial
were
locked
up
in

i
looked
round
me
tranquilly
and
contentedly
like
a
quiet
ghost
with
a
clean
conscience
sitting
inside
the
bars
of
a
snug
family
vault

thought
i

up

ahab’s

and
crew
fedallah
“who
would
have
thought
it
flask!”
cried
stubb
“if
i
had
but
one
leg
you
would
not
catch
me
in
a
boat
unless
maybe
to
stop
the
plug-hole
with
my
timber
toe
oh
he’s
a
wonderful
old
man!”
“i
don’t
think
it
so
strange
after
all
on
that
account,”
said
flask
“if
his
leg
were
off
at
the
hip
now
it
would
be
a
different
thing
that
would
disable
him
but
he
has
one
knee
and
good
part
of
the
other
left
you
know.”
“i
don’t
know
that
my
little

i
never

among
whale-wise
people
it
has
often
been
argued
whether
considering
the
paramount
importance
of
his
life
to
the
success
of
the
voyage
it
is
right
for
a
whaling
captain
to
jeopardize
that
life
in
the
active
perils
of
the
chase
so
tamerlane’s
soldiers
often
argued
with
tears
in
their
eyes
whether
that
invaluable
life
of
his
ought
to
be
carried
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
but
with
ahab
the
question
assumed
a
modified
aspect
considering
that
with
two
legs
man
is
but
a
hobbling
wight
in
all
times
of
danger
considering
that
the
pursuit
of
whales
is
always
under
great
and
extraordinary
difficulties
that
every
individual
moment
indeed
then
comprises
a
peril
under
these
circumstances
is
it
wise
for
any
maimed
man
to
enter
a
whale-boat
in
the
hunt
as
a
general
thing
the
joint-owners
of
the
pequod
must
have
plainly
thought
not
ahab
well
knew
that
although
his
friends
at
home
would
think
little
of
his
entering
a
boat
in
certain
comparatively
harmless
vicissitudes
of
the
chase
for
the
sake
of
being
near
the
scene
of
action
and
giving
his
orders
in
person
yet
for
captain
ahab
to
have
a
boat
actually
apportioned
to
him
as
a
regular
headsman
in
the
hunt—above
all
for
captain
ahab
to
be
supplied
with
five
extra
men
as
that
same
boat’s
crew
he
well
knew
that
such
generous
conceits
never
entered
the
heads
of
the
owners
of
the
pequod
therefore
he
had
not
solicited
a
boat’s
crew
from
them
nor
had
he
in
any
way
hinted
his
desires
on
that
head
nevertheless
he
had
taken
private
measures
of
his
own
touching
all
that
matter
until
cabaco’s
published
discovery
the
sailors
had
little
foreseen
it
though
to
be
sure
when
after
being
a
little
while
out
of
port
all
hands
had
concluded
the
customary
business
of
fitting
the
whaleboats
for
service
when
some
time
after
this
ahab
was
now
and
then
found
bestirring
himself
in
the
matter
of
making
thole-pins
with
his
own
hands
for
what
was
thought
to
be
one
of
the
spare
boats
and
even
solicitously
cutting
the
small
wooden
skewers
which
when
the
line
is
running
out
are
pinned
over
the
groove
in
the
bow
when
all
this
was
observed
in
him
and
particularly
his
solicitude
in
having
an
extra
coat
of
sheathing
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
as
if
to
make
it
better
withstand
the
pointed
pressure
of
his
ivory
limb
and
also
the
anxiety
he
evinced
in
exactly
shaping
the
thigh
board
or
clumsy
cleat
as
it
is
sometimes
called
the
horizontal
piece
in
the
boat’s
bow
for
bracing
the
knee
against
in
darting
or
stabbing
at
the
whale
when
it
was
observed
how
often
he
stood
up
in
that
boat
with
his
solitary
knee
fixed
in
the
semi-circular
depression
in
the
cleat
and
with
the
carpenter’s
chisel
gouged
out
a
little
here
and
straightened
it
a
little
there
all
these
things
i
say
had
awakened
much
interest
and
curiosity
at
the
time
but
almost
everybody
supposed
that
this
particular
preparative
heedfulness
in
ahab
must
only
be
with
a
view
to
the
ultimate
chase
of
moby
dick
for
he
had
already
revealed
his
intention
to
hunt
that
mortal
monster
in
person
but
such
a
supposition
did
by
no
means
involve
the
remotest
suspicion
as
to
any
boat’s
crew
being
assigned
to
that
boat
now
with
the
subordinate
phantoms
what
wonder
remained

waned

soon
wane
besides
now
and
then
such
unaccountable
odds
and
ends
of
strange
nations
come
up
from
the
unknown
nooks
and
ash-holes
of
the
earth
to
man
these
floating
outlaws
of
whalers
and
the
ships

often
pick
up
such
queer
castaway
creatures

tossing
about
the
open
sea
on
planks
bits
of
wreck
oars
whaleboats
canoes
blown-off
japanese
junks
and
what
not
that
beelzebub
himself
might
climb
up
the
side
and
step
down
into
the
cabin
to
chat
with
the
captain
and
it
would
not
create
any
unsubduable
excitement
in
the
forecastle
but
be
all
this
as
it
may
certain
it
is
that
while
the
subordinate
phantoms
soon
found
their
place
among
the
crew
though
still
as
it
were
somehow
distinct
from
them
yet
that
hair-turbaned
fedallah
remained
a
muffled
mystery
to
the
last
whence
he
came
in
a
mannerly
world
like
this
by
what
sort
of
unaccountable
tie
he
soon
evinced
himself
to
be
linked
with
ahab’s
peculiar
fortunes
nay
so
far
as
to
have
some
sort
of
a
half-hinted
influence
heaven
knows
but
it
might
have
been
even
authority
over
him
all
this
none
knew

one
cannot
sustain
an
indifferent
air
concerning
fedallah
he
was
such
a
creature
as

in
their

unalterable

even
in

modern

still
preserve
much
of
the
ghostly
aboriginalness
of
earth’s

when
the

of
the

man
was
a
distinct
recollection

all

he
came

it

while
gliding
through

that
one
serene
and
moonlight
night
when
all
the
waves
rolled
by
like
scrolls
of
silver
and
by
their
soft
suffusing
seethings
made
what
seemed
a
silvery
silence
not
a
solitude
on
such
a
silent
night
a
silvery
jet
was
seen
far
in
advance
of
the
white
bubbles
at
the
bow
lit
up
by
the
moon
it
looked
celestial

some
plumed
and
glittering

from

first
descried
this
jet
for
of
these
moonlight
nights
it
was
his
wont
to
mount
to
the
main-mast
head
and
stand
a
look-out
there
with
the
same
precision
as
if
it
had
been
day
and
yet
though
herds
of
whales
were
seen
by
night
not
one
whaleman
in
a
hundred
would
venture
a
lowering
for
them
you
may
think
with
what
emotions
then
the
seamen
beheld
this
old
oriental
perched
aloft
at
such
unusual
hours
his
turban
and
the
moon
companions
in
one
sky
but
when
after
spending
his
uniform
interval
there
for
several
successive
nights
without
uttering
a
single
sound
when
after
all
this
silence
his
unearthly
voice
was
heard
announcing
that
silvery
moon-lit
jet
every
reclining
mariner
started
to
his
feet
as
if
some
winged
spirit
had
lighted
in
the
rigging
and
hailed
the
mortal
crew
“there
she
blows!”
had
the
trump
of
judgment
blown
they
could
not
have
quivered
more
yet
still
they
felt
no
terror
rather
pleasure
for
though
it
was
a
most
unwonted
hour
yet
so
impressive
was
the
cry
and
so
deliriously
exciting
that
almost
every
soul
on
board
instinctively
desired
a
lowering
walking
the
deck
with
quick
side-lunging
strides
ahab
commanded
the
t’gallant
sails
and
royals
to
be
set
and
every
stunsail
spread
the
best
man
in
the
ship
must
take
the
helm
then
with
every
mast-head
manned
the
piled-up
craft
rolled
down
before
the
wind
the
strange
upheaving
lifting
tendency
of
the
taffrail
breeze
filling
the
hollows
of
so
many
sails
made
the
buoyant
hovering
deck
to
feel
like
air
beneath
the
feet
while
still
she
rushed
along
as
if
two
antagonistic
influences
were
struggling
in
her—one
to
mount
direct
to
heaven
the
other
to
drive
yawingly
to
some
horizontal
goal
and
had
you
watched
ahab’s
face
that
night
you
would
have
thought
that
in
him
also
two
different
things
were
warring
while
his
one
live
leg
made
lively
echoes
along
the
deck
every
stroke
of
his
dead
limb
sounded
like
a
coffin-tap
on
life
and
death
this
old
man
walked
but
though
the
ship
so
swiftly
sped
and
though
from
every
eye
like
arrows
the
eager
glances
shot
yet
the
silvery
jet
was
no
more
seen
that
night
every
sailor
swore
he
saw
it
once
but
not
a
second
time
this
midnight-spout
had
almost
grown
a
forgotten
thing
when
some
days
after
lo
at
the
same
silent
hour
it
was
again
announced
again
it
was
descried
by
all
but
upon
making
sail
to
overtake
it
once
more
it
disappeared
as
if
it
had
never
been
and
so
it
served
us
night
after
night
till
no
one
heeded
it
but
to
wonder
at
it
mysteriously
jetted
into
the
clear
moonlight
or
starlight
as
the
case
might
be
disappearing
again
for
one
whole
day
or
two
days
or
three
and
somehow
seeming
at
every
distinct
repetition
to
be
advancing
still
further
and
further
in
our
van
this
solitary
jet
seemed
for
ever
alluring
us
on
nor
with
the
immemorial
superstition
of
their
race
and
in
accordance
with
the
preternaturalness
as
it
seemed
which
in
many
things
invested
the
pequod
were
there
wanting
some
of
the
seamen
who
swore
that
whenever
and
wherever
descried
at
however
remote
times
or
in
however
far
apart
latitudes
and
longitudes
that
unnearable
spout
was
cast
by
one
self-same
whale
and
that
whale
moby
dick
for
a
time
there
reigned
too
a
sense
of
peculiar
dread
at
this
flitting
apparition
as
if
it
were
treacherously
beckoning
us
on
and
on
in
order
that
the
monster
might
turn
round
upon
us
and
rend
us
at
last
in
the
remotest
and
most
savage
seas
these
temporary
apprehensions
so
vague
but
so
awful
derived
a
wondrous
potency
from
the
contrasting
serenity
of
the
weather
in
which
beneath
all
its
blue
blandness
some
thought
there
lurked
a
devilish
charm
as
for
days
and
days
we
voyaged
along
through
seas
so
wearily
lonesomely
mild
that
all
space
in
repugnance
to
our
vengeful
errand
seemed
vacating
itself
of
life
before
our
urn-like
prow
but
at
last
when
turning
to
the
eastward
the
cape
winds
began
howling
around
us
and
we
rose
and
fell
upon
the
long
troubled
seas
that
are
there
when
the
ivory-tusked
pequod
sharply
bowed
to
the
blast
and
gored
the
dark
waves
in
her
madness
till
like
showers
of
silver
chips
the
foam-flakes
flew
over
her
bulwarks
then
all
this
desolate
vacuity
of
life
went
away
but
gave
place
to
sights
more
dismal
than
before
close
to
our
bows
strange
forms
in
the
water
darted
hither
and
thither
before
us
while
thick
in
our
rear
flew
the
inscrutable
sea-ravens
and
every
morning
perched
on
our
stays
rows
of
these
birds
were
seen
and
spite
of
our
hootings
for
a
long
time
obstinately
clung
to
the
hemp
as
though
they
deemed
our
ship
some
drifting
uninhabited
craft
a
thing
appointed
to
desolation
and
therefore
fit
roosting-place
for
their
homeless
selves
and
heaved
and
heaved
still
unrestingly
heaved
the
black
sea
as
if
its
vast
tides
were
a
conscience
and
the
great
mundane
soul
were
in
anguish
and
remorse
for
the
long
sin
and
suffering
it
had
bred
cape
of
good
hope
do
they
call
ye
rather
cape
tormentoso
as
called
of
yore
for
long
allured
by
the
perfidious
silences
that
before
had
attended
us
we
found
ourselves
launched
into
this
tormented
sea
where
guilty
beings
transformed
into
those
fowls
and
these
fish
seemed
condemned
to
swim
on
everlastingly
without
any
haven
in
store
or
beat
that
black
air
without
any
horizon
but
calm
snow-white
and
unvarying
still
directing
its
fountain
of
feathers
to
the
sky
still
beckoning
us
on
from
before
the
solitary
jet
would
at
times
be
descried
during
all
this
blackness
of
the
elements
ahab
though
assuming
for
the
time
the
almost
continual
command
of
the
drenched
and
dangerous
deck
manifested
the
gloomiest
reserve
and
more
seldom
than
ever
addressed
his
mates
in
tempestuous
times
like
these
after
everything
above
and
aloft
has
been
secured
nothing
more
can
be
done
but
passively
to
await
the
issue
of
the
gale
then
captain
and
crew
become
practical
fatalists
so
with
his
ivory
leg
inserted
into
its
accustomed
hole
and
with
one
hand
firmly
grasping
a
shroud
ahab
for
hours
and
hours
would
stand
gazing
dead
to
windward
while
an
occasional
squall
of
sleet
or
snow
would
all
but
congeal
his
very
eyelashes
together
meantime
the
crew
driven
from
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
by
the
perilous
seas
that
burstingly
broke
over
its
bows
stood
in
a
line
along
the
bulwarks
in
the
waist
and
the
better
to
guard
against
the
leaping
waves
each
man
had
slipped
himself
into
a
sort
of
bowline
secured
to
the
rail
in
which
he
swung
as
in
a
loosened
belt
few
or
no
words
were
spoken
and
the
silent
ship
as
if
manned
by
painted
sailors
in
wax
day
after
day
tore
on
through
all

the
albatross
south-eastward
from
the
cape
off
the
distant
crozetts
a
good
cruising
ground
for
right
whalemen
a
sail
loomed
ahead
the
goney
albatross
by
name
as
she
slowly
drew
nigh
from
my
lofty
perch
at
the
fore-mast-head
i
had
a
good
view
of
that
sight
so
remarkable
to
a
tyro
in
the
far
ocean
fisheries—a
whaler
at
sea
and
long
absent
from
home
as
if
the
waves
had
been
fullers
this
craft
was
bleached
like
the
skeleton
of
a
stranded
walrus
all
down
her
sides
this
spectral
appearance
was
traced
with
long
channels
of
reddened
rust
while
all
her
spars
and
her
rigging
were
like
the
thick
branches
of
trees
furred
over
with
hoar-frost
only
her
lower
sails
were
set
a
wild
sight
it
was
to
see
her
long-bearded
look-outs
at
those
three
mast-heads
they
seemed
clad
in
the
skins
of
beasts
so
torn
and
bepatched
the
raiment
that
had
survived
nearly
four
years
of
cruising
standing
in
iron
hoops
nailed
to
the
mast
they
swayed
and
swung
over
a
fathomless
sea
and
though
when
the
ship
slowly
glided
close
under
our
stern
we
six
men
in
the
air
came
so
nigh
to
each
other
that
we
might
almost
have
leaped
from
the
mast-heads
of
one
ship
to
those
of
the
other
yet
those
forlorn-looking
fishermen
mildly
eyeing
us
as
they
passed
said
not
one
word
to
our
own
look-outs
while
the
quarter-deck
hail
was
being
heard
from
below
“ship
ahoy
have
ye
seen
the
white
whale?”
but
as
the
strange
captain
leaning
over
the
pallid
bulwarks
was
in
the
act
of
putting
his
trumpet
to
his
mouth
it
somehow
fell
from
his
hand
into
the
sea
and
the
wind
now
rising
amain
he
in
vain
strove
to
make
himself
heard
without
it
meantime
his
ship
was
still
increasing
the
distance
between
while
in
various
silent
ways
the
seamen
of
the
pequod
were
evincing
their
observance
of
this
ominous
incident
at
the
first
mere
mention
of
the
white
whale’s
name
to
another
ship
ahab
for
a
moment
paused
it
almost
seemed
as
though
he
would
have
lowered
a
boat
to
board
the
stranger
had
not
the
threatening
wind
forbade
but
taking
advantage
of
his
windward
position
he
again
seized
his
trumpet
and
knowing
by
her
aspect
that
the
stranger
vessel
was
a
nantucketer
and
shortly
bound
home
he
loudly
hailed—“ahoy
there
this
is
the
pequod
bound
round
the
world
tell
them
to
address
all
future
letters
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
this
time
three
years
if
i
am
not
at
home
tell
them
to
address
them
to
——”
at
that
moment
the
two
wakes
were
fairly
crossed
and
instantly
then
in
accordance
with
their
singular
ways
shoals
of
small
harmless
fish
that
for
some
days
before
had
been
placidly
swimming
by
our
side
darted
away
with
what
seemed
shuddering
fins
and
ranged
themselves
fore
and
aft
with
the
stranger’s
flanks
though
in
the
course
of
his
continual
voyagings
ahab
must
often
before
have
noticed
a
similar
sight
yet
to
any
monomaniac
man
the
veriest
trifles
capriciously
carry
meanings
“swim
away
from
me
do
ye?”
murmured
ahab
gazing
over
into
the
water
there
seemed
but
little
in
the
words
but
the
tone
conveyed
more
of
deep
helpless
sadness
than
the
insane
old
man
had
ever
before
evinced
but
turning
to
the
steersman
who
thus
far
had
been
holding
the
ship
in
the
wind
to
diminish
her
headway
he
cried
out
in
his
old
lion
voice,—“up
helm
keep
her
off
round
the
world!”
round
the
world
there
is
much
in
that
sound
to
inspire
proud
feelings
but
whereto
does
all
that
circumnavigation
conduct
only
through
numberless
perils
to
the
very
point
whence
we
started
where
those
that
we
left
behind
secure
were
all
the
time
before
us
were
this

an
endless
plain

by
sailing

we
could
for
ever
reach
new

discover
sights
more
sweet
and

or

in

in

of
those

mysteries
we
dream
of

in
tormented
chase
of
that
demon
phantom
that
some
time
or
other
swims
before
all
human
hearts
while
chasing
such
over
this
round
globe
they
either
lead
us
on
in

mazes
or
midway

the
gam
the
ostensible
reason
why
ahab
did
not
go
on
board
of
the
whaler
we
had
spoken
was
this
the
wind
and
sea
betokened
storms
but
even
had
this
not
been
the
case
he
would
not
after
all
perhaps
have
boarded
her—judging
by
his
subsequent
conduct
on
similar
occasions—if
so
it
had
been
that
by
the
process
of
hailing
he
had
obtained
a
negative
answer
to
the
question
he
put
for
as
it
eventually
turned
out
he
cared
not
to
consort
even
for
five
minutes
with
any
stranger
captain
except
he
could
contribute
some
of
that
information
he
so
absorbingly
sought
but
all
this
might
remain
inadequately
estimated
were
not
something
said
here
of
the
peculiar
usages
of
whaling-vessels
when
meeting
each
other
in
foreign
seas
and
especially
on
a
common
cruising-ground
if
two
strangers
crossing
the
pine
barrens
in
new
york
state
or
the
equally
desolate
salisbury
plain
in
england
if
casually
encountering
each
other
in
such
inhospitable
wilds
these
twain
for
the
life
of
them
cannot
well
avoid
a
mutual
salutation
and
stopping
for
a
moment
to
interchange
the
news
and
perhaps
sitting
down
for
a
while
and
resting
in
concert
then
how
much
more
natural
that
upon
the
illimitable
pine
barrens
and
salisbury
plains
of
the
sea
two
whaling
vessels
descrying
each
other
at
the
ends
of
the
earth—off
lone
fanning’s
island
or
the
far
away
king’s
mills
how
much
more
natural
i
say
that
under
such
circumstances
these
ships
should
not
only
interchange
hails
but
come
into
still
closer
more
friendly
and
sociable
contact
and
especially
would
this
seem
to
be
a
matter
of
course
in
the
case
of
vessels
owned
in
one
seaport
and
whose
captains
officers
and
not
a
few
of
the
men
are
personally
known
to
each
other
and
consequently
have
all
sorts
of
dear
domestic
things
to
talk
about
for
the
long
absent
ship
the
outward-bounder
perhaps
has
letters
on
board
at
any
rate
she
will
be
sure
to
let
her
have
some
papers
of
a
date
a
year
or
two
later
than
the
last
one
on
her
blurred
and
thumb-worn
files
and
in
return
for
that
courtesy
the
outward-bound
ship
would
receive
the
latest
whaling
intelligence
from
the
cruising-ground
to
which
she
may
be
destined
a
thing
of
the
utmost
importance
to
her
and
in
degree
all
this
will
hold
true
concerning
whaling
vessels
crossing
each
other’s
track
on
the
cruising-ground
itself
even
though
they
are
equally
long
absent
from
home
for
one
of
them
may
have
received
a
transfer
of
letters
from
some
third
and
now
far
remote
vessel
and
some
of
those
letters
may
be
for
the
people
of
the
ship
she
now
meets
besides
they
would
exchange
the
whaling
news
and
have
an
agreeable
chat
for
not
only
would
they
meet
with
all
the
sympathies
of
sailors
but
likewise
with
all
the
peculiar
congenialities
arising
from
a
common
pursuit
and
mutually
shared
privations
and
perils
nor
would
difference
of
country
make
any
very
essential
difference
that
is
so
long
as
both
parties
speak
one
language
as
is
the
case
with
americans
and
english
though
to
be
sure
from
the
small
number
of
english
whalers
such
meetings
do
not
very
often
occur
and
when
they
do
occur
there
is
too
apt
to
be
a
sort
of
shyness
between
them
for
your
englishman
is
rather
reserved
and
your
yankee
he
does
not
fancy
that
sort
of
thing
in
anybody
but
himself
besides
the
english
whalers
sometimes
affect
a
kind
of
metropolitan
superiority
over
the
american
whalers
regarding
the
long
lean
nantucketer
with
his
nondescript
provincialisms
as
a
sort
of
sea-peasant
but
where
this
superiority
in
the
english
whalemen
does
really
consist
it
would
be
hard
to
say
seeing
that
the
yankees
in
one
day
collectively
kill
more
whales
than
all
the
english
collectively
in
ten
years
but
this
is
a
harmless
little
foible
in
the
english
whale-hunters
which
the
nantucketer
does
not
take
much
to
heart
probably
because
he
knows
that
he
has
a
few
foibles
himself
so
then
we
see
that
of
all
ships
separately
sailing
the
sea
the
whalers
have
most
reason
to
be
sociable—and
they
are
so
whereas
some
merchant
ships
crossing
each
other’s
wake
in
the
mid-atlantic
will
oftentimes
pass
on
without
so
much
as
a
single
word
of
recognition
mutually
cutting
each
other
on
the
high
seas
like
a
brace
of
dandies
in
broadway
and
all
the
time
indulging
perhaps
in
finical
criticism
upon
each
other’s
rig
as
for
men-of-war
when
they
chance
to
meet
at
sea
they
first
go
through
such
a
string
of
silly
bowings
and
scrapings
such
a
ducking
of
ensigns
that
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
right-down
hearty
good-will
and
brotherly
love
about
it
at
all
as
touching
slave-ships
meeting
why
they
are
in
such
a
prodigious
hurry
they
run
away
from
each
other
as
soon
as
possible
and
as
for
pirates
when
they
chance
to
cross
each
other’s
cross-bones
the
first
hail
is—“how
many
skulls?”—the
same
way
that
whalers
hail—“how
many
barrels?”
and
that
question
once
answered
pirates
straightway
steer
apart
for
they
are
infernal
villains
on
both
sides
and
don’t
like
to
see
overmuch
of
each
other’s
villanous
likenesses
but
look
at
the
godly
honest
unostentatious
hospitable
sociable
free-and-easy
whaler
what
does
the
whaler
do
when
she
meets
another
whaler
in
any
sort
of
decent
weather
she
has
a
“_gam_,”
a
thing
so
utterly
unknown
to
all
other
ships
that
they
never
heard
of
the
name
even
and
if
by
chance
they
should
hear
of
it
they
only
grin
at
it
and
repeat
gamesome
stuff
about
“spouters”
and
“blubber-boilers,”
and
such
like
pretty
exclamations
why
it
is
that
all
merchant-seamen
and
also
all
pirates
and
man-of-war’s
men
and
slave-ship
sailors
cherish
such
a
scornful
feeling
towards
whale-ships
this
is
a
question
it
would
be
hard
to
answer
because
in
the
case
of
pirates
say
i
should
like
to
know
whether
that
profession
of
theirs
has
any
peculiar
glory
about
it
it
sometimes
ends
in
uncommon
elevation
indeed
but
only
at
the
gallows
and
besides
when
a
man
is
elevated
in
that
odd
fashion
he
has
no
proper
foundation
for
his
superior
altitude
hence
i
conclude
that
in
boasting
himself
to
be
high
lifted
above
a
whaleman
in
that
assertion
the
pirate
has
no
solid
basis
to
stand
on
but
what
is
a
_gam?_
you
might
wear
out
your
index-finger
running
up
and
down
the
columns
of
dictionaries
and
never
find
the
word
dr
johnson
never
attained
to
that
erudition
noah
webster’s
ark
does
not
hold
it
nevertheless
this
same
expressive
word
has
now
for
many
years
been
in
constant
use
among
some
fifteen
thousand
true
born
yankees
certainly
it
needs
a
definition
and
should
be
incorporated
into
the
lexicon
with
that
view
let
me
learnedly
define
it
gam
noun—_a
social
meeting
of
two_
_or
more_
_whaleships
generally
on
a
cruising-ground
when
after
exchanging
hails
they
exchange
visits
by
boats’
crews
the
two
captains
remaining
for
the
time
on
board
of
one
ship
and
the
two
chief
mates
on
the
other._
there
is
another
little
item
about
gamming
which
must
not
be
forgotten
here
all
professions
have
their
own
little
peculiarities
of
detail
so
has
the
whale
fishery
in
a
pirate
man-of-war
or
slave
ship
when
the
captain
is
rowed
anywhere
in
his
boat
he
always
sits
in
the
stern
sheets
on
a
comfortable
sometimes
cushioned
seat
there
and
often
steers
himself
with
a
pretty
little
milliner’s
tiller
decorated
with
gay
cords
and
ribbons
but
the
whale-boat
has
no
seat
astern
no
sofa
of
that
sort
whatever
and
no
tiller
at
all
high
times
indeed
if
whaling
captains
were
wheeled
about
the
water
on
castors
like
gouty
old
aldermen
in
patent
chairs
and
as
for
a
tiller
the
whale-boat
never
admits
of
any
such
effeminacy
and
therefore
as
in
gamming
a
complete
boat’s
crew
must
leave
the
ship
and
hence
as
the
boat
steerer
or
harpooneer
is
of
the
number
that
subordinate
is
the
steersman
upon
the
occasion
and
the
captain
having
no
place
to
sit
in
is
pulled
off
to
his
visit
all
standing
like
a
pine
tree
and
often
you
will
notice
that
being
conscious
of
the
eyes
of
the
whole
visible
world
resting
on
him
from
the
sides
of
the
two
ships
this
standing
captain
is
all
alive
to
the
importance
of
sustaining
his
dignity
by
maintaining
his
legs
nor
is
this
any
very
easy
matter
for
in
his
rear
is
the
immense
projecting
steering
oar
hitting
him
now
and
then
in
the
small
of
his
back
the
after-oar
reciprocating
by
rapping
his
knees
in
front
he
is
thus
completely
wedged
before
and
behind
and
can
only
expand
himself
sideways
by
settling
down
on
his
stretched
legs
but
a
sudden
violent
pitch
of
the
boat
will
often
go
far
to
topple
him
because
length
of
foundation
is
nothing
without
corresponding
breadth
merely
make
a
spread
angle
of
two
poles
and
you
cannot
stand
them
up
then
again
it
would
never
do
in
plain
sight
of
the
world’s
riveted
eyes
it
would
never
do
i
say
for
this
straddling
captain
to
be
seen
steadying
himself
the
slightest
particle
by
catching
hold
of
anything
with
his
hands
indeed
as
token
of
his
entire
buoyant
self-command
he
generally
carries
his
hands
in
his
trowsers’
pockets
but
perhaps
being
generally
very
large
heavy
hands
he
carries
them
there
for
ballast
nevertheless
there
have
occurred
instances
well
authenticated
ones
too
where
the
captain
has
been
known
for
an
uncommonly
critical
moment
or
two
in
a
sudden
squall
say—to
seize
hold
of
the
nearest
oarsman’s
hair
and
hold
on
there
like

death

was
encountered
she
was
manned
almost
wholly
by
polynesians
in
the
short
gam
that
ensued
she
gave
us
strong
news
of
moby
dick
to
some
the
general
interest
in
the
white
whale
was
now
wildly
heightened
by
a
circumstance
of
the
town-ho’s
story
which
seemed
obscurely
to
involve
with
the
whale
a
certain
wondrous
inverted
visitation
of
one
of
those
so
called
judgments
of
god
which
at
times
are
said
to
overtake
some
men
this
latter
circumstance
with
its
own
particular
accompaniments
forming
what
may
be
called
the
secret
part
of
the
tragedy
about
to
be
narrated
never
reached
the
ears
of
captain
ahab
or
his
mates
for
that
secret
part
of
the
story
was
unknown
to
the
captain
of
the
town-ho
himself
it
was
the
private
property
of
three
confederate
white
seamen
of
that
ship
one
of
whom
it
seems
communicated
it
to
tashtego
with
romish
injunctions
of
secrecy
but
the
following
night
tashtego
rambled
in
his
sleep
and
revealed
so
much
of
it
in
that
way
that
when
he
was
wakened
he
could
not
well
withhold
the
rest
nevertheless
so
potent
an
influence
did
this
thing
have
on
those
seamen
in
the
pequod
who
came
to
the
full
knowledge
of
it
and
by
such
a
strange
delicacy
to
call
it
so
were
they
governed
in
this
matter
that
they
kept
the
secret
among
themselves
so
that
it
never
transpired
abaft
the
pequod’s
main-mast
interweaving
in
its
proper
place
this
darker
thread
with
the
story
as
publicly
narrated
on
the
ship
the
whole
of
this
strange
affair
i
now
proceed
to
put
on
lasting
record
*the
ancient
whale-cry
upon
first
sighting
a
whale
from
the
mast-head
still
used
by
whalemen
in
hunting
the
famous
gallipagos
terrapin
for
my
humor’s
sake
i
shall
preserve
the
style
in
which
i
once
narrated
it
at
lima
to
a
lounging
circle
of
my
spanish
friends
one
saint’s
eve
smoking
upon
the
thick-gilt
tiled
piazza
of
the
golden
inn
of
those
fine
cavaliers
the
young
dons
pedro
and
sebastian
were
on
the
closer
terms
with
me
and
hence
the
interluding
questions
they
occasionally
put
and
which
are
duly
answered
at
the
time
“some
two
years
prior
to
my
first
learning
the
events
which
i
am
about
rehearsing
to
you
gentlemen
the
town-ho
sperm
whaler
of
nantucket
was
cruising
in
your
pacific
here
not
very
many
days’
sail
eastward
from
the
eaves
of
this
good
golden
inn
she
was
somewhere
to
the
northward
of
the
line
one
morning
upon
handling
the
pumps
according
to
daily
usage
it
was
observed
that
she
made
more
water
in
her
hold
than
common
they
supposed
a
sword-fish
had
stabbed
her
gentlemen
but
the
captain
having
some
unusual
reason
for
believing
that
rare
good
luck
awaited
him
in
those
latitudes
and
therefore
being
very
averse
to
quit
them
and
the
leak
not
being
then
considered
at
all
dangerous
though
indeed
they
could
not
find
it
after
searching
the
hold
as
low
down
as
was
possible
in
rather
heavy
weather
the
ship
still
continued
her
cruisings
the
mariners
working
at
the
pumps
at
wide
and
easy
intervals
but
no
good
luck
came
more
days
went
by
and
not
only
was
the
leak
yet
undiscovered
but
it
sensibly
increased
so
much
so
that
now
taking
some
alarm
the
captain
making
all
sail
stood
away
for
the
nearest
harbor
among
the
islands
there
to
have
his
hull
hove
out
and
repaired
“though
no
small
passage
was
before
her
yet
if
the
commonest
chance
favoured
he
did
not
at
all
fear
that
his
ship
would
founder
by
the
way
because
his
pumps
were
of
the
best
and
being
periodically
relieved
at
them
those
six-and-thirty
men
of
his
could
easily
keep
the
ship
free
never
mind
if
the
leak
should
double
on
her
in
truth
well
nigh
the
whole
of
this
passage
being
attended
by
very
prosperous
breezes
the
town-ho
had
all
but
certainly
arrived
in
perfect
safety
at
her
port
without
the
occurrence
of
the
least
fatality
had
it
not
been
for
the
brutal
overbearing
of
radney
the
mate
a
vineyarder
and
the
bitterly
provoked
vengeance
of
steelkilt
a
lakeman
and
desperado
from
buffalo
“‘lakeman!—buffalo
pray
what
is
a
lakeman
and
where
is
buffalo?’
said
don
sebastian
rising
in
his
swinging
mat
of
grass
“on

three-masted
ships
well-nigh
as
large

stout
as

that
ever

old
callao

lakeman

the
land-locked

an
ocean-like
expansiveness
with
many
of
the
ocean’s
noblest
traits
with
many
of
its
rimmed
varieties
of
races
and
of
climes
they
contain
round
archipelagoes
of
romantic
isles
even
as
the
polynesian
waters
do
in
large
part

shored

two
great
contrasting
nations

the

furnish
long
maritime
approaches
to
our
numerous
territorial
colonies

the
east
dotted
all
round
their
banks
here

there
are
frowned
upon
by
batteries
and
by
the
goat-like
craggy
guns
of
lofty
mackinaw
they
have
heard
the
fleet
thunderings
of
naval
victories
at
intervals
they
yield
their
beaches
to
wild
barbarians

red
painted
faces
flash
from
out

peltry
wigwams
for
leagues

flanked
by

out

however
inland
they
have
drowned
full
many
a
midnight
ship
with
all
its
shrieking
crew
thus
gentlemen
though
an
inlander
steelkilt
was
wild-ocean
born
and
wild-ocean
nurtured
as
much
of
an
audacious
mariner
as
any
and
for
radney
though
in
his
infancy
he
may
have
laid
him
down
on
the
lone
nantucket
beach
to
nurse
at
his
maternal
sea
though
in
after
life
he
had
long
followed
our
austere
atlantic
and
your
contemplative
pacific
yet
was
he
quite
as
vengeful
and
full
of
social
quarrel
as
the
backwoods
seaman
fresh
from
the
latitudes
of
buck-horn
handled
bowie-knives
yet
was
this
nantucketer
a
man
with
some
good-hearted
traits
and
this
lakeman
a
mariner
who
though
a
sort
of
devil
indeed
might
yet
by
inflexible
firmness
only
tempered
by
that
common
decency
of
human
recognition
which
is
the
meanest
slave’s
right
thus
treated
this
steelkilt
had
long
been
retained
harmless
and
docile
at
all
events
he
had
proved
so
thus
far
but
radney
was
doomed
and
made
mad
and
steelkilt—but
gentlemen
you
shall
hear
“it
was
not
more
than
a
day
or
two
at
the
furthest
after
pointing
her
prow
for
her
island
haven
that
the
town-ho’s
leak
seemed
again
increasing
but
only
so
as
to
require
an
hour
or
more
at
the
pumps
every
day
you
must
know
that
in
a
settled
and
civilized
ocean
like
our
atlantic
for
example
some
skippers
think
little
of
pumping
their
whole
way
across
it
though
of
a
still
sleepy
night
should
the
officer
of
the
deck
happen
to
forget
his
duty
in
that
respect
the
probability
would
be
that
he
and
his
shipmates
would
never
again
remember
it
on
account
of
all
hands
gently
subsiding
to
the
bottom
nor
in
the
solitary
and
savage
seas
far
from
you
to
the
westward
gentlemen
is
it
altogether
unusual
for
ships
to
keep
clanging
at
their
pump-handles
in
full
chorus
even
for
a
voyage
of
considerable
length
that
is
if
it
lie
along
a
tolerably
accessible
coast
or
if
any
other
reasonable
retreat
is
afforded
them
it
is
only
when
a
leaky
vessel
is
in
some
very
out
of
the
way
part
of
those
waters
some
really
landless
latitude
that
her
captain
begins
to
feel
a
little
anxious
“much
this
way
had
it
been
with
the
town-ho
so
when
her
leak
was
found
gaining
once
more
there
was
in
truth
some
small
concern
manifested
by
several
of
her
company
especially
by
radney
the
mate
he
commanded
the
upper
sails
to
be
well
hoisted
sheeted
home
anew
and
every
way
expanded
to
the
breeze
now
this
radney
i
suppose
was
as
little
of
a
coward
and
as
little
inclined
to
any
sort
of
nervous
apprehensiveness
touching
his
own
person
as
any
fearless
unthinking
creature
on
land
or
on
sea
that
you
can
conveniently
imagine
gentlemen
therefore
when
he
betrayed
this
solicitude
about
the
safety
of
the
ship
some
of
the
seamen
declared
that
it
was
only
on
account
of
his
being
a
part
owner
in
her
so
when
they
were
working
that
evening
at
the
pumps
there
was
on
this
head
no
small
gamesomeness
slily
going
on
among
them
as
they
stood
with
their
feet
continually
overflowed
by
the
rippling
clear
water
clear
as
any
mountain
spring
gentlemen—that
bubbling
from
the
pumps
ran
across
the
deck
and
poured
itself
out
in
steady
spouts
at
the
lee
scupper-holes
“now
as
you
well
know
it
is
not
seldom
the
case
in
this
conventional
world
of
ours—watery
or
otherwise
that
when
a
person
placed
in
command
over
his
fellow-men
finds
one
of
them
to
be
very
significantly
his
superior
in
general
pride
of
manhood
straightway
against
that
man
he
conceives
an
unconquerable
dislike
and
bitterness
and
if
he
have
a
chance
he
will
pull
down
and
pulverize
that
subaltern’s
tower
and
make
a
little
heap
of
dust
of
it
be
this
conceit
of
mine
as
it
may
gentlemen
at
all
events
steelkilt
was
a
tall
and
noble
animal
with
a
head
like
a
roman
and
a
flowing
golden
beard
like
the
tasseled
housings
of
your
last
viceroy’s
snorting
charger
and
a
brain
and
a
heart
and
a
soul
in
him
gentlemen
which
had
made
steelkilt
charlemagne
had
he
been
born
son
to
charlemagne’s
father
but
radney
the
mate
was
ugly
as
a
mule
yet
as
hardy
as
stubborn
as
malicious
he
did
not
love
steelkilt
and
steelkilt
knew
it
“espying
the
mate
drawing
near
as
he
was
toiling
at
the
pump
with
the
rest
the
lakeman
affected
not
to
notice
him
but
unawed
went
on
with
his
gay
banterings
“‘aye
aye
my
merry
lads
it’s
a
lively
leak
this
hold
a
cannikin
one
of
ye
and
let’s
have
a
taste
by
the
lord
it’s
worth
bottling
i
tell
ye
what
men
old
rad’s
investment
must
go
for
it
he
had
best
cut
away
his
part
of
the
hull
and
tow
it
home
the
fact
is
boys
that
sword-fish
only
began
the
job
he’s
come
back
again
with
a
gang
of
ship-carpenters
saw-fish
and
file-fish
and
what
not
and
the
whole
posse
of
’em
are
now
hard
at
work
cutting
and
slashing
at
the
bottom
making
improvements
i
suppose
if
old
rad
were
here
now
i’d
tell
him
to
jump
overboard
and
scatter
’em
they’re
playing
the
devil
with
his
estate
i
can
tell
him
but
he’s
a
simple
old
soul,—rad
and
a
beauty
too
boys
they
say
the
rest
of
his
property
is
invested
in
looking-glasses
i
wonder
if
he’d
give
a
poor
devil
like
me
the
model
of
his
nose.’
“‘damn
your
eyes
what’s
that
pump
stopping
for?’
roared
radney
pretending
not
to
have
heard
the
sailors’
talk
‘thunder
away
at
it!’
“‘aye
aye
sir,’
said
steelkilt
merry
as
a
cricket
‘lively
boys
lively
now!’
and
with
that
the
pump
clanged
like
fifty
fire-engines
the
men
tossed
their
hats
off
to
it
and
ere
long
that
peculiar
gasping
of
the
lungs
was
heard
which
denotes
the
fullest
tension
of
life’s
utmost
energies
“quitting
the
pump
at
last
with
the
rest
of
his
band
the
lakeman
went
forward
all
panting
and
sat
himself
down
on
the
windlass
his
face
fiery
red
his
eyes
bloodshot
and
wiping
the
profuse
sweat
from
his
brow
now
what
cozening
fiend
it
was
gentlemen
that
possessed
radney
to
meddle
with
such
a
man
in
that
corporeally
exasperated
state
i
know
not
but
so
it
happened
intolerably
striding
along
the
deck
the
mate
commanded
him
to
get
a
broom
and
sweep
down
the
planks
and
also
a
shovel
and
remove
some
offensive
matters
consequent
upon
allowing
a
pig
to
run
at
large
“now
gentlemen
sweeping
a
ship’s
deck
at
sea
is
a
piece
of
household
work
which
in
all
times
but
raging
gales
is
regularly
attended
to
every
evening
it
has
been
known
to
be
done
in
the
case
of
ships
actually
foundering
at
the
time
such
gentlemen
is
the
inflexibility
of
sea-usages
and
the
instinctive
love
of
neatness
in
seamen
some
of
whom
would
not
willingly
drown
without
first
washing
their
faces
but
in
all
vessels
this
broom
business
is
the
prescriptive
province
of
the
boys
if
boys
there
be
aboard
besides
it
was
the
stronger
men
in
the
town-ho
that
had
been
divided
into
gangs
taking
turns
at
the
pumps
and
being
the
most
athletic
seaman
of
them
all
steelkilt
had
been
regularly
assigned
captain
of
one
of
the
gangs
consequently
he
should
have
been
freed
from
any
trivial
business
not
connected
with
truly
nautical
duties
such
being
the
case
with
his
comrades
i
mention
all
these
particulars
so
that
you
may
understand
exactly
how
this
affair
stood
between
the
two
men
“but
there
was
more
than
this
the
order
about
the
shovel
was
almost
as
plainly
meant
to
sting
and
insult
steelkilt
as
though
radney
had
spat
in
his
face
any
man
who
has
gone
sailor
in
a
whale-ship
will
understand
this
and
all
this
and
doubtless
much
more
the
lakeman
fully
comprehended
when
the
mate
uttered
his
command
but
as
he
sat
still
for
a
moment
and
as
he
steadfastly
looked
into
the
mate’s
malignant
eye
and
perceived
the
stacks
of
powder-casks
heaped
up
in
him
and
the
slow-match
silently
burning
along
towards
them
as
he
instinctively
saw
all
this
that
strange
forbearance
and
unwillingness
to
stir
up
the
deeper
passionateness
in
any
already
ireful
being—a
repugnance
most
felt
when
felt
at
all
by
really
valiant
men
even
when
aggrieved—this
nameless
phantom
feeling
gentlemen
stole
over
steelkilt
“therefore
in
his
ordinary
tone
only
a
little
broken
by
the
bodily
exhaustion
he
was
temporarily
in
he
answered
him
saying
that
sweeping
the
deck
was
not
his
business
and
he
would
not
do
it
and
then
without
at
all
alluding
to
the
shovel
he
pointed
to
three
lads
as
the
customary
sweepers
who
not
being
billeted
at
the
pumps
had
done
little
or
nothing
all
day
to
this
radney
replied
with
an
oath
in
a
most
domineering
and
outrageous
manner
unconditionally
reiterating
his
command
meanwhile
advancing
upon
the
still
seated
lakeman
with
an
uplifted
cooper’s
club
hammer
which
he
had
snatched
from
a
cask
near
by
“heated
and
irritated
as
he
was
by
his
spasmodic
toil
at
the
pumps
for
all
his
first
nameless
feeling
of
forbearance
the
sweating
steelkilt
could
but
ill
brook
this
bearing
in
the
mate
but
somehow
still
smothering
the
conflagration
within
him
without
speaking
he
remained
doggedly
rooted
to
his
seat
till
at
last
the
incensed
radney
shook
the
hammer
within
a
few
inches

with

turmoil
ensued

standing
out

danced
up

down
with
a
whale-pike

upon

him

close
up

prying
into

for

hastily
slewing
about
three
or
four
large
casks
in
a
line
with
the
windlass
these
sea-parisians
entrenched
themselves
behind
the
barricade

out

the

now
menacing
them
with
a
pistol
in

brought
to
him
by

steward

leaped
on
the
barricade
and
striding
up
and
down
there
defied
the
worst
the
pistols
could
do
but
gave
the
captain
to
understand
distinctly
that
his
steelkilt’s
death
would
be
the
signal
for
a
murderous
mutiny
on
the
part
of
all
hands
fearing
in
his
heart
lest
this
might
prove
but
too
true
the
captain
a
little
desisted
but
still
commanded
the
insurgents
instantly
to
return
to
their
duty
“‘will
you
promise
not
to
touch
us
if
we
do?’
demanded
their
ringleader
“‘turn

turn

make
no

your

you
want

sink
the
ship
by
knocking
off

he
once
more
raised
a
pistol
“‘sink
the

cried
steelkilt
‘aye

turning
to
his
comrades
a
fierce
cheer
was
their
response
“the
lakeman
now
patrolled
the
barricade
all
the
while
keeping
his
eye
on
the
captain
and
jerking
out
such
sentences
as
these:—‘it’s
not

didn’t

told

“‘turn

ye
now,’

the
lakeman

out
his
arm
towards
him

“‘turn
to!’

the

glanced
round
him
a
moment

then
said:—‘i
tell
you

it

a

rascal

ye
attack

till
you

the
word
about
not

down
with
ye
i’ll
keep
ye
there
till
ye’re
sick
of
it
down
ye
go.’

we?’
cried
the
ringleader
to
his
men

of
them
were
against
it
but
at
length
in
obedience
to
steelkilt
they
preceded
him
down
into
their
dark
den
growlingly
disappearing
like
bears
into
a
cave
“as
the
lakeman’s
bare
head
was
just
level
with
the
planks
the
captain
and
his
posse
leaped
the
barricade
and
rapidly
drawing
over
the
slide
of
the
scuttle
planted
their
group
of
hands
upon
it
and
loudly
called
for
the
steward
to
bring
the
heavy
brass
padlock

to

companionway

opening

captain

something
down

crack

turned
the
key
upon

in

on
deck
some
twenty
or
more

thus
far
had
remained
neutral

watch

by
all
the

about

it

through

hours
of
darkness
passed

still
remained
at

duty
toiling
hard
at
the
pumps

clinking
and
clanking
at
intervals
through
the
dreary
night
dismally
resounded
through
the
ship
“at
sunrise

captain
went
forward

knocking
on
the
deck
summoned
the
prisoners
to
work

with
a
yell
they
refused

then
lowered
down
to
them

a
couple
of
handfuls
of
biscuit
were
tossed
after
it

upon

returned
to
the
quarter-deck
twice

three

on
the
fourth
morning
a
confused
wrangling
and
then
a
scuffling
was
heard
as
the
customary
summons
was
delivered
and
suddenly
four
men
burst
up
from
the
forecastle
saying
they
were
ready
to
turn
to
the
fetid
closeness
of
the
air
and
a
famishing
diet
united
perhaps
to
some
fears
of
ultimate
retribution
had
constrained
them
to
surrender
at
discretion
emboldened
by
this
the
captain
reiterated
his
demand
to
the
rest

steelkilt
shouted
up
to
him
a
terrific
hint
to
stop
his
babbling
and
betake
himself
where
he
belonged
on
the
fifth
morning
three
others
of
the
mutineers
bolted
up
into
the
air
from
the
desperate
arms
below
that
sought
to
restrain
them
only
three
were
left
“‘better
turn
to
now?’
said
the
captain
with
a
heartless
jeer
“‘shut
us
up
again
will
ye!’
cried
steelkilt
“‘oh
certainly,’
said
the
captain
and
the
key
clicked

at
this
point
gentlemen

enraged
by
the
defection
of
seven
of
his
former
associates

stung
by
the
mocking
voice
that
had

hailed
him
and
maddened
by
his
long
entombment
in
a
place
as
black
as
the
bowels
of
despair

was
then
that
steelkilt
proposed
to
the
two
canallers

apparently
of

burst
out
of

hole
at

next

with

amuck
from

should
spend
in

the
scheme
met
with
no

swore
they
were
ready
for
that
or
for
any
other
mad
thing
for
anything
in
short
but
a
surrender

what
was
more
they
each
insisted
upon
being
the
first
man
on
deck

the
time
to
make
the
rush
should
come
but
to
this
their
leader
as
fiercely
objected
reserving
that
priority
for
himself
particularly
as
his
two
comrades
would
not
yield
the
one
to
the
other
in
the
matter
and
both
of
them
could
not
be

man
at
a
time

the
foul
play
of
these
miscreants
must
come
out
“upon
hearing
the
frantic
project
of
their
leader

in
his
own
separate
soul

suddenly
lighted

would
seem
upon
the

piece
of
treachery

to
be
foremost
in
breaking
out

three

in

together

into

their

bound
the
sleeper
with
cords

gagged
him
with
cords

shrieked
out
for
the
captain
at
midnight
“thinking

smelling
in
the
dark
for

to
flog
them
all
round—thought
upon
the
whole
he
would
do
so—he
ought
to—justice
demanded
it
but
for
the
present
considering
their
timely
surrender
he
would
let
them
go
with
a
reprimand
which
he
accordingly
administered
in
the
vernacular
“‘but
as
for
you
ye
carrion
rogues,’
turning
to
the
three
men
in
the
rigging—‘for
you
i
mean
to
mince
ye
up
for
the
try-pots;’
and
seizing
a
rope
he
applied
it
with
all
his
might
to
the
backs
of
the
two
traitors
till
they
yelled
no
more
but
lifelessly
hung
their
heads
sideways
as
the
two
crucified
thieves
are
drawn
“‘my
wrist
is
sprained
with
ye!’
he
cried
at
last
‘but
there
is
still
rope
enough
left
for
you
my
fine
bantam
that
wouldn’t
give
up
take
that
gag
from
his
mouth
and
let
us
hear
what
he
can
say
for
himself.’
“for
a
moment
the
exhausted
mutineer
made
a
tremulous
motion
of
his
cramped
jaws
and
then
painfully
twisting
round
his
head
said
in
a
sort
of
hiss
‘what
i
say
is
this—and
mind
it
well—if
you
flog
me
i
murder
you!’
“‘say
ye
so
then
see
how
ye
frighten
me’—and
the
captain
drew
off
with
the
rope
to
strike
“‘best
not,’
hissed
the
lakeman
“‘but
i
must,’—and
the
rope
was
once
more
drawn
back
for
the
stroke
“steelkilt
here
hissed
out
something
inaudible
to
all
but
the
captain
who
to
the
amazement
of
all
hands
started
back
paced
the
deck
rapidly
two
or
three
times
and
then
suddenly
throwing
down
his
rope
said
‘i
won’t
do
it—let
him
go—cut
him
down
d’ye
hear?’
“but
as
the
junior
mates
were
hurrying
to
execute
the
order
a
pale
man
with
a
bandaged
head
arrested
them—radney
the
chief
mate
ever
since
the
blow
he
had
lain
in
his
berth
but
that
morning
hearing
the
tumult
on
the
deck
he
had
crept
out
and
thus
far
had
watched
the
whole
scene
such
was
the
state
of
his
mouth
that
he
could
hardly
speak
but
mumbling
something
about
_his_
being
willing
and
able
to
do
what
the
captain
dared
not
attempt
he
snatched
the
rope
and
advanced
to
his
pinioned
foe
“‘you
are
a
coward!’
hissed
the
lakeman
“‘so
i
am
but
take
that.’
the
mate
was
in
the
very
act
of
striking
when
another
hiss
stayed
his
uplifted
arm
he
paused
and
then
pausing
no
more
made
good
his
word
spite
of
steelkilt’s
threat
whatever
that
might
have
been
the
three
men
were
then
cut
down
all
hands
were
turned
to
and
sullenly
worked
by
the
moody
seamen
the
iron
pumps
clanged
as
before
“just
after
dark
that
day
when
one
watch
had
retired
below
a
clamor
was
heard
in
the
forecastle
and
the
two
trembling
traitors
running
up
besieged
the
cabin
door
saying
they
durst
not
consort
with
the
crew
entreaties
cuffs
and
kicks
could
not
drive
them
back
so
at
their
own
instance
they
were
put
down
in
the
ship’s
run
for
salvation
still
no
sign
of
mutiny
reappeared
among
the
rest
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
that
mainly
at
steelkilt’s
instigation
they
had
resolved
to
maintain
the
strictest
peacefulness
obey
all
orders
to
the
last
and
when
the
ship
reached
port
desert
her
in
a
body
but
in
order
to
insure
the
speediest
end
to
the
voyage
they
all
agreed
to
another
thing—namely
not
to
sing
out
for
whales
in
case
any
should
be
discovered
for
spite
of
her
leak
and
spite
of
all
her
other
perils
the
town-ho
still
maintained
her
mast-heads
and
her
captain
was
just
as
willing
to
lower
for
a
fish
that
moment
as
on
the
day
his
craft
first
struck
the
cruising
ground
and
radney
the
mate
was
quite
as
ready
to
change
his
berth
for
a
boat
and
with
his
bandaged
mouth
seek
to
gag
in
death
the
vital
jaw
of
the
whale
“but
though
the
lakeman
had
induced
the
seamen
to
adopt
this
sort
of
passiveness
in
their
conduct
he
kept
his
own
counsel
at
least
till
all
was
over
concerning
his
own
proper
and
private
revenge
upon
the
man
who
had
stung
him
in
the
ventricles
of
his
heart
he
was
in
radney
the
chief
mate’s
watch
and
as
if
the
infatuated
man
sought
to
run
more
than
half
way
to
meet
his
doom
after
the
scene
at
the
rigging
he
insisted
against
the
express
counsel
of
the
captain
upon
resuming
the
head
of
his
watch
at
night
upon
this
and
one
or
two
other
circumstances
steelkilt
systematically
built
the
plan
of
his
revenge
“during
the
night
radney
had
an
unseamanlike
way
of
sitting
on
the
bulwarks
of
the
quarter-deck
and
leaning
his
arm
upon
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
which
was
hoisted
up
there
a
little
above
the
ship’s
side
in
this
attitude
it
was
well
known
he
sometimes
dozed
there
was
a
considerable
vacancy
between
the
boat
and
the
ship
and
down
between
this
was
the
sea
steelkilt
calculated
his
time
and
found
that
his
next
trick
at
the
helm
would
come
round
at
two
o’clock
in
the
morning
of
the
third
day
from
that
in
which
he
had
been
betrayed
at
his
leisure
he
employed
the
interval
in
braiding
something
very
carefully
in
his
watches
below
“‘what
are
you
making
there?’
said
a
shipmate
“‘what
do
you
think
what
does
it
look
like?’
“‘like
a
lanyard
for
your
bag
but
it’s
an
odd
one
seems
to
me.’
“‘yes
rather
oddish,’
said
the
lakeman
holding
it
at
arm’s
length
before
him
‘but
i
think
it
will
answer
shipmate
i
haven’t
enough
twine,—have
you
any?’
“but
there
was
none
in
the
forecastle
“‘then
i
must
get
some
from
old
rad;’
and
he
rose
to
go
aft
“‘you
don’t
mean
to
go
a
begging
to
_him!_’
said
a
sailor
“‘why
not
do
you
think
he
won’t
do
me
a
turn
when
it’s
to
help
himself
in
the
end
shipmate?’
and
going
to
the
mate
he
looked
at
him
quietly
and
asked
him
for
some
twine
to
mend
his
hammock
it
was
given
him—neither
twine
nor
lanyard
were
seen
again
but
the
next
night
an
iron
ball
closely
netted
partly
rolled
from
the
pocket
of
the
lakeman’s
monkey
jacket
as
he
was
tucking
the
coat
into
his
hammock
for
a
pillow
twenty-four
hours
after
his
trick
at
the
silent
helm—nigh
to
the
man
who
was
apt
to
doze
over
the
grave
always
ready
dug
to
the
seaman’s
hand—that
fatal
hour
was
then
to
come
and
in
the
fore-ordaining
soul
of
steelkilt
the
mate
was
already
stark
and
stretched
as
a
corpse
with
his
forehead
crushed
in
“but
gentlemen
a
fool
saved
the
would-be
murderer
from
the
bloody
deed
he
had
planned
yet
complete
revenge
he
had
and
without
being
the
avenger
for
by
a
mysterious
fatality
heaven
itself
seemed
to
step
in
to
take
out
of
his
hands
into
its
own
the
damning
thing
he
would
have
done
“it
was
just
between
daybreak
and
sunrise
of
the
morning
of
the
second
day
when
they
were
washing
down
the
decks
that
a
stupid
teneriffe
man
drawing
water
in
the
main-chains
all
at
once
shouted
out
‘there
she
rolls
there
she
rolls!’
jesu
what
a
whale
it
was
moby
dick
“‘moby
dick!’
cried
don
sebastian
‘st
dominic
sir
sailor
but
do
whales
have
christenings
whom
call
you
moby
dick?’
“‘a
very
white
and
famous
and
most
deadly
immortal
monster
don;—but
that
would
be
too
long
a
story.’
“‘how
how?’
cried
all
the
young
spaniards
crowding
“‘nay
dons
dons—nay
nay
i
cannot
rehearse
that
now
let
me
get
more
into
the
air
sirs.’
“‘the
chicha
the
chicha!’
cried
don
pedro
‘our
vigorous
friend
looks
faint;—fill
up
his
empty
glass!’
“no
need
gentlemen
one
moment
and
i
proceed.—now
gentlemen
so
suddenly
perceiving
the
snowy
whale
within
fifty
yards
of
the
ship—forgetful
of
the
compact
among
the
crew—in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
the
teneriffe
man
had
instinctively
and
involuntarily
lifted
his
voice
for
the
monster
though
for
some
little
time
past
it
had
been
plainly
beheld
from
the
three
sullen
mast-heads
all
was
now
a
phrensy
‘the
white
whale—the
white
whale!’
was
the
cry
from
captain
mates
and
harpooneers
who
undeterred
by
fearful
rumours
were
all
anxious
to
capture
so
famous
and
precious
a
fish
while
the
dogged
crew
eyed
askance
and
with
curses
the
appalling
beauty
of
the
vast
milky
mass
that
lit
up
by
a
horizontal
spangling
sun
shifted
and
glistened
like
a
living
opal
in
the
blue
morning
sea
gentlemen
a
strange
fatality
pervades
the
whole
career
of
these
events
as
if
verily
mapped
out
before
the
world
itself
was
charted
the
mutineer
was
the
bowsman
of
the
mate
and
when
fast
to
a
fish
it
was
his
duty
to
sit
next
him
while
radney
stood
up
with
his
lance
in
the
prow
and
haul
in
or
slacken
the
line
at
the
word
of
command
moreover
when
the
four
boats
were
lowered
the
mate’s
got
the
start
and
none
howled
more
fiercely
with
delight
than
did
steelkilt
as
he
strained
at
his
oar
after
a
stiff
pull
their
harpooneer
got
fast
and
spear
in
hand
radney
sprang
to
the
bow
he
was
always
a
furious
man
it
seems
in
a
boat
and
now
his
bandaged
cry
was
to
beach
him
on
the
whale’s
topmost
back
nothing
loath
his
bowsman
hauled
him
up
and
up
through
a
blinding
foam
that
blent
two
whitenesses
together
till
of
a
sudden
the
boat
struck
as
against
a
sunken
ledge
and
keeling
over
spilled
out
the
standing
mate
that
instant
as
he
fell
on
the
whale’s
slippery
back
the
boat
righted
and
was
dashed
aside
by
the
swell
while
radney
was
tossed
over
into
the
sea
on
the
other
flank
of
the
whale
he
struck
out
through
the
spray
and
for
an
instant
was
dimly
seen
through
that
veil
wildly
seeking
to
remove
himself
from
the
eye
of
moby
dick
but
the
whale
rushed
round
in
a
sudden
maelstrom
seized
the
swimmer
between
his
jaws
and
rearing
high
up
with
him
plunged
headlong
again
and
went
down
“meantime
at
the
first
tap
of
the
boat’s
bottom
the
lakeman
had
slackened
the
line
so
as
to
drop
astern
from
the
whirlpool
calmly
looking
on
he
thought
his
own
thoughts
but
a
sudden
terrific
downward
jerking
of
the
boat
quickly
brought
his
knife
to
the
line
he
cut
it
and
the
whale
was
free
but
at
some
distance
moby
dick
rose
again
with
some
tatters
of
radney’s
red
woollen
shirt
caught
in
the
teeth
that
had
destroyed
him
all
four
boats
gave
chase
again
but
the
whale
eluded
them
and
finally
wholly
disappeared
“in
good
time
the
town-ho
reached
her
port—a
savage
solitary
place—where
no
civilized
creature
resided
there
headed
by
the
lakeman
all
but
five
or
six
of
the
foremastmen
deliberately
deserted
among
the
palms
eventually
as
it
turned
out
seizing
a
large
double
war-canoe
of
the
savages
and
setting
sail
for
some
other
harbor
“the
ship’s
company
being
reduced
to
but
a
handful
the
captain
called
upon
the
islanders
to
assist
him
in
the
laborious
business
of
heaving
down
the
ship
to
stop
the
leak
but
to
such
unresting
vigilance
over
their
dangerous
allies
was
this
small
band
of
whites
necessitated
both
by
night
and
by
day
and
so
extreme
was
the
hard
work
they
underwent
that
upon
the
vessel
being
ready
again
for
sea
they
were
in
such
a
weakened
condition
that
the
captain
durst
not
put
off
with
them
in
so
heavy
a
vessel
after
taking
counsel
with
his
officers
he
anchored
the
ship
as
far
off
shore
as
possible
loaded
and
ran
out
his
two
cannon
from
the
bows
stacked
his
muskets
on
the
poop
and
warning
the
islanders
not
to
approach
the
ship
at
their
peril
took
one
man
with
him
and
setting
the
sail
of
his
best
whale-boat
steered
straight
before
the
wind
for
tahiti
five
hundred
miles
distant
to
procure
a
reinforcement
to
his
crew
“on
the
fourth
day
of
the
sail
a
large
canoe
was
descried
which
seemed
to
have
touched
at
a
low
isle
of
corals
he
steered
away
from
it
but
the
savage
craft
bore
down
on
him
and
soon
the
voice
of
steelkilt
hailed
him
to
heave
to
or
he
would
run
him
under
water
the
captain
presented
a
pistol
with
one
foot
on
each
prow
of
the
yoked
war-canoes
the
lakeman
laughed
him
to
scorn
assuring
him
that
if
the
pistol
so
much
as
clicked
in
the
lock
he
would
bury
him
in
bubbles
and
foam
“‘what
do
you
want
of
me?’
cried
the
captain
“‘where
are
you
bound
and
for
what
are
you
bound?’
demanded
steelkilt
‘no
lies.’
“‘i
am
bound
to
tahiti
for
more
men.’
“‘very
good
let
me
board
you
a
moment—i
come
in
peace.’
with
that
he
leaped
from
the
canoe
swam
to
the
boat
and
climbing
the
gunwale
stood
face
to
face
with
the
captain
“‘cross
your
arms
sir
throw
back
your
head
now
repeat
after
me
as
soon
as
steelkilt
leaves
me
i
swear
to
beach
this
boat
on
yonder
island
and
remain
there
six
days
if
i
do
not
may
lightnings
strike
me!’
“‘a
pretty
scholar,’
laughed
the
lakeman
‘adios
senor!’
and
leaping
into
the
sea
he
swam
back
to
his
comrades
“watching
the
boat
till
it
was
fairly
beached
and
drawn
up
to
the
roots
of
the
cocoa-nut
trees
steelkilt
made
sail
again
and
in
due
time
arrived
at
tahiti
his
own
place
of
destination
there
luck
befriended
him
two
ships
were
about
to
sail
for
france
and
were
providentially
in
want
of
precisely
that
number
of
men
which
the
sailor
headed
they
embarked
and
so
for
ever
got
the
start
of
their
former
captain
had
he
been
at
all
minded
to
work
them
legal
retribution
“some
ten
days
after
the
french
ships
sailed
the
whale-boat
arrived
and
the
captain
was
forced
to
enlist
some
of
the
more
civilized
tahitians
who
had
been
somewhat
used
to
the
sea
chartering
a
small
native
schooner
he
returned
with
them
to
his
vessel
and
finding
all
right
there
again
resumed
his
cruisings
“where
steelkilt
now
is
gentlemen
none
know
but
upon
the
island
of
nantucket

widow
of
radney
still
turns
to
the

refuses

give
up

destroyed

chapter
55
of
the
monstrous
pictures
of
whales
i
shall
ere
long
paint
to
you
as
well
as
one
can
without
canvas
something
like
the
true
form
of
the
whale
as
he
actually
appears
to
the
eye
of
the
whaleman
when
in
his
own
absolute
body
the
whale
is
moored
alongside
the
whale-ship
so
that
he
can
be
fairly
stepped
upon
there
it
may
be
worth
while
therefore
previously
to
advert
to
those
curious
imaginary
portraits
of
him
which
even
down
to
the
present
day
confidently
challenge
the
faith
of
the
landsman
it
is
time
to
set
the
world
right
in
this
matter
by
proving
such
pictures
of
the
whale
all
wrong
it
may
be
that
the
primal
source
of
all
those
pictorial
delusions
will
be
found
among
the
oldest
hindoo
egyptian
and
grecian
sculptures
for
ever
since
those
inventive
but
unscrupulous
times
when
on
the
marble
panellings
of
temples
the
pedestals
of
statues
and
on
shields
medallions
cups
and
coins
the
dolphin
was
drawn
in
scales
of
chain-armor
like
saladin’s
and
a
helmeted
head
like
st
george’s
ever
since
then
has
something
of
the
same
sort
of
license
prevailed
not
only
in
most
popular
pictures
of
the
whale
but
in
many
scientific
presentations
of
him
now
by
all
odds
the
most
ancient
extant
portrait
anyways
purporting
to
be
the
whale’s
is
to
be
found
in
the
famous
cavern-pagoda
of
elephanta
in
india
the
brahmins
maintain
that
in
the
almost
endless
sculptures
of
that
immemorial
pagoda
all
the
trades
and
pursuits
every
conceivable
avocation
of
man
were
prefigured
ages
before
any
of
them
actually
came
into
being
no
wonder
then
that
in
some
sort
our
noble
profession
of
whaling
should
have
been
there
shadowed
forth
the
hindoo
whale
referred
to
occurs
in
a
separate
department
of
the
wall
depicting
the
incarnation
of
vishnu
in
the
form
of
leviathan
learnedly
known
as
the
matse
avatar
but
though
this
sculpture
is
half
man
and
half
whale
so
as
only
to
give
the
tail
of
the
latter
yet
that
small
section
of
him
is
all
wrong
it
looks
more
like
the
tapering
tail
of
an
anaconda
than
the
broad
palms
of
the
true
whale’s
majestic
flukes
but
go
to
the
old
galleries
and
look
now
at
a
great
christian
painter’s
portrait
of
this
fish
for
he
succeeds
no
better
than
the
antediluvian
hindoo
it
is
guido’s
picture
of
perseus
rescuing
andromeda
from
the
sea-monster
or
whale
where
did
guido
get
the
model
of
such
a
strange
creature
as
that
nor
does
hogarth
in
painting
the
same
scene
in
his
own
“perseus
descending,”
make
out
one
whit
better
the
huge
corpulence
of
that
hogarthian
monster
undulates
on
the
surface
scarcely
drawing
one
inch
of
water
it
has
a
sort
of
howdah
on
its
back
and
its
distended
tusked
mouth
into
which
the
billows
are
rolling
might
be
taken
for
the
traitors’
gate
leading
from
the
thames
by
water
into
the
tower
then
there
are
the
prodromus
whales
of
old
scotch
sibbald
and
jonah’s
whale
as
depicted
in
the
prints
of
old
bibles
and
the
cuts
of
old
primers
what
shall
be
said
of
these
as
for
the
book-binder’s
whale
winding
like
a
vine-stalk
round
the
stock
of
a
descending
anchor—as
stamped
and
gilded
on
the
backs
and
title-pages
of
many
books
both
old
and
new—that
is
a
very
picturesque
but
purely
fabulous
creature
imitated
i
take
it
from
the
like
figures
on
antique
vases
though
universally
denominated
a
dolphin
i
nevertheless
call
this
book-binder’s
fish
an
attempt
at
a
whale
because
it
was
so
intended
when
the
device
was
first
introduced
it
was
introduced
by
an
old
italian
publisher
somewhere
about
the
15th
century
during
the
revival
of
learning
and
in
those
days
and
even
down
to
a
comparatively
late
period
dolphins
were
popularly
supposed
to
be
a
species
of
the
leviathan
in
the
vignettes
and
other
embellishments
of
some
ancient
books
you
will
at
times
meet
with
very
curious
touches
at
the
whale
where
all
manner
of
spouts
jets
d’eau
hot
springs
and
cold
saratoga
and
baden-baden
come
bubbling
up
from
his
unexhausted
brain
in
the
title-page
of
the
original
edition
of
the
“advancement
of
learning”
you
will
find
some
curious
whales
but
quitting
all
these
unprofessional
attempts
let
us
glance
at
those
pictures
of
leviathan
purporting
to
be
sober
scientific
delineations
by
those
who
know
in
old
harris’s
collection
of
voyages
there
are
some
plates
of
whales
extracted
from
a
dutch
book
of
voyages
a.d
1671
entitled
“a
whaling
voyage
to
spitzbergen
in
the
ship
jonas
in
the
whale
peter
peterson
of
friesland
master.”
in
one
of
those
plates
the
whales
like
great
rafts
of
logs
are
represented
lying
among
ice-isles
with
white
bears
running
over
their
living
backs
in
another
plate
the
prodigious
blunder
is
made
of
representing
the
whale
with
perpendicular
flukes
then
again
there
is
an
imposing
quarto
written
by
one
captain
colnett
a
post
captain
in
the
english
navy
entitled
“a
voyage
round
cape
horn
into
the
south
seas
for
the
purpose
of
extending
the
spermaceti
whale
fisheries.”
in
this
book
is
an
outline
purporting
to
be
a
“picture
of
a
physeter
or
spermaceti
whale
drawn
by
scale
from
one
killed
on
the
coast
of
mexico
august
1793
and
hoisted
on
deck.”
i
doubt
not
the
captain
had
this
veracious
picture
taken
for
the
benefit
of
his
marines
to
mention
but
one
thing
about
it
let
me
say
that
it
has
an
eye
which
applied
according
to
the
accompanying
scale
to
a
full
grown
sperm
whale
would
make
the
eye
of
that
whale
a
bow-window
some
five
feet
long
ah
my
gallant
captain
why
did
ye
not
give
us
jonah
looking
out
of
that
eye
nor
are
the
most
conscientious
compilations
of
natural
history
for
the
benefit
of
the
young
and
tender
free
from
the
same
heinousness
of
mistake
look
at
that
popular
work
“goldsmith’s
animated
nature.”
in
the
abridged
london
edition
of
1807
there
are
plates
of
an
alleged
“whale”
and
a
“narwhale.”
i
do
not
wish
to
seem
inelegant
but
this
unsightly
whale
looks
much
like
an
amputated
sow
and
as
for
the
narwhale
one
glimpse
at
it
is
enough
to
amaze
one
that
in
this
nineteenth
century
such
a
hippogriff
could
be
palmed
for
genuine
upon
any
intelligent
public
of
schoolboys
then
again
in
1825
bernard
germain
count
de
lacépède
a
great
naturalist
published
a
scientific
systemized
whale
book
wherein
are
several
pictures
of
the
different
species
of
the
leviathan
all
these
are
not
only
incorrect
but
the
picture
of
the
mysticetus
or
greenland
whale
that
is
to
say
the
right
whale
even
scoresby
a
long
experienced
man
as
touching
that
species
declares
not
to
have
its
counterpart
in
nature
but
the
placing
of
the
cap-sheaf
to
all
this
blundering
business
was
reserved
for
the
scientific
frederick
cuvier
brother
to
the
famous
baron
in
1836
he
published
a
natural
history
of
whales
in
which
he
gives
what
he
calls
a
picture
of
the
sperm
whale
before
showing
that
picture
to
any
nantucketer
you
had
best
provide
for
your
summary
retreat
from
nantucket
in
a
word
frederick
cuvier’s
sperm
whale
is
not
a
sperm
whale
but
a
squash
of
course
he
never
had
the
benefit
of
a
whaling
voyage
such
men
seldom
have
but
whence
he
derived
that
picture
who
can
tell
perhaps
he
got
it
as
his
scientific
predecessor
in
the
same
field
desmarest
got
one
of
his
authentic
abortions
that
is
from
a
chinese
drawing
and
what
sort
of
lively
lads
with
the
pencil
those
chinese
are
many
queer
cups
and
saucers
inform
us
as
for
the
sign-painters’
whales
seen
in
the
streets
hanging
over
the
shops
of
oil-dealers
what
shall
be
said
of
them
they
are
generally
richard
iii
whales
with
dromedary
humps
and
very
savage
breakfasting
on
three
or
four
sailor
tarts
that
is
whaleboats
full
of
mariners
their
deformities
floundering
in
seas
of
blood
and
blue
paint
but
these
manifold
mistakes
in
depicting
the
whale
are
not
so
very
surprising
after
all
consider
most
of
the
scientific
drawings
have
been
taken
from
the
stranded
fish
and
these
are
about
as
correct
as
a
drawing
of
a
wrecked
ship
with
broken
back
would
correctly
represent
the
noble
animal
itself
in
all
its
undashed
pride
of
hull
and
spars
though
elephants
have
stood
for
their
full-lengths
the
living
leviathan
has
never
yet
fairly
floated
himself
for
his
portrait
the
living
whale
in
his
full
majesty
and
significance
is
only
to
be
seen
at
sea
in
unfathomable
waters
and
afloat
the
vast
bulk
of
him
is
out
of
sight
like
a
launched
line-of-battle
ship
and
out
of
that
element
it
is
a
thing
eternally
impossible
for
mortal
man
to
hoist
him
bodily
into
the
air
so
as
to
preserve
all
his
mighty
swells
and
undulations
and
not
to
speak
of
the
highly
presumable
difference
of
contour
between
a
young
sucking
whale
and
a
full-grown
platonian
leviathan
yet
even
in
the
case
of
one
of
those
young
sucking
whales
hoisted
to
a
ship’s
deck
such
is
then
the
outlandish
eel-like
limbered
varying
shape
of
him
that
his
precise
expression
the
devil
himself
could
not
catch
but
it
may
be
fancied
that
from
the
naked
skeleton
of
the
stranded
whale
accurate
hints
may
be
derived
touching
his
true
form
not
at
all
for
it
is
one
of
the
more
curious
things
about
this
leviathan
that
his
skeleton
gives
very
little
idea
of
his
general
shape
though
jeremy
bentham’s
skeleton
which
hangs
for
candelabra
in
the
library
of
one
of
his
executors
correctly
conveys
the
idea
of
a
burly-browed
utilitarian
old
gentleman
with
all
jeremy’s
other
leading
personal
characteristics
yet
nothing
of
this
kind
could
be
inferred
from
any
leviathan’s
articulated
bones
in
fact
as
the
great
hunter
says
the
mere
skeleton
of
the
whale
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
fully
invested
and
padded
animal
as
the
insect
does
to
the
chrysalis
that
so
roundingly
envelopes
it
this
peculiarity
is
strikingly
evinced
in
the
head
as
in
some
part
of
this
book
will
be
incidentally
shown
it
is
also
very
curiously
displayed
in
the
side
fin
the
bones
of
which
almost
exactly
answer
to
the
bones
of
the
human
hand
minus
only
the
thumb
this
fin
has
four
regular
bone-fingers
the
index
middle
ring
and
little
finger
but
all
these
are
permanently
lodged
in
their
fleshy
covering
as
the
human
fingers
in
an
artificial
covering
“however
recklessly
the
whale
may
sometimes
serve
us,”
said
humorous
stubb
one
day
“he
can
never
be
truly
said
to
handle
us
without
mittens.”
for
all
these
reasons
then
any
way
you
may
look
at
it
you
must
needs
conclude
that
the
great
leviathan
is
that
one
creature
in
the
world
which
must
remain
unpainted
to
the
last
true
one
portrait
may
hit
the
mark
much
nearer
than
another
but
none
can
hit
it
with
any
very
considerable
degree
of
exactness
so
there
is
no
earthly
way
of
finding
out
precisely
what
the
whale
really
looks
like
and
the
only
mode
in
which
you
can
derive
even
a
tolerable
idea
of
his
living
contour
is
by
going
a
whaling
yourself
but
by
so
doing
you
run
no
small
risk
of
being
eternally
stove
and
sunk
by
him
wherefore
it
seems
to
me
you
had
best
not
be
too
fastidious
in
your
curiosity
touching
this
leviathan
chapter
56
of
the
less
erroneous
pictures
of
whales
and
the
true
pictures
of
whaling
scenes
in
connexion
with
the
monstrous
pictures
of
whales
i
am
strongly
tempted
here
to
enter
upon
those
still
more
monstrous
stories
of
them
which
are
to
be
found
in
certain
books
both
ancient
and
modern
especially
in
pliny
purchas
hackluyt
harris
cuvier
etc
but
i
pass
that
matter
by
i
know
of
only
four
published
outlines
of
the
great
sperm
whale
colnett’s
huggins’s
frederick
cuvier’s
and
beale’s
in
the
previous
chapter
colnett
and
cuvier
have
been
referred
to
huggins’s
is
far
better
than
theirs
but
by
great
odds
beale’s
is
the
best
all
beale’s
drawings
of
this
whale
are
good
excepting
the
middle
figure
in
the
picture
of
three
whales
in
various
attitudes
capping
his
second
chapter
his
frontispiece
boats
attacking
sperm
whales
though
no
doubt
calculated
to
excite
the
civil
scepticism
of
some
parlor
men
is
admirably
correct
and
life-like
in
its
general
effect
some
of
the
sperm
whale
drawings
in
j
ross
browne
are
pretty
correct
in
contour
but
they
are
wretchedly
engraved
that
is
not
his
fault
though
of
the
right
whale
the
best
outline
pictures
are
in
scoresby
but
they
are
drawn
on
too
small
a
scale
to
convey
a
desirable
impression
he
has
but
one
picture
of
whaling
scenes
and
this
is
a
sad
deficiency
because
it
is
by
such
pictures
only
when
at
all
well
done
that
you
can
derive
anything
like
a
truthful
idea
of
the
living
whale
as
seen
by
his
living
hunters
but
taken
for
all
in
all
by
far
the
finest
though
in
some
details
not
the
most
correct
presentations
of
whales
and
whaling
scenes
to
be
anywhere
found
are
two
large
french
engravings
well
executed
and
taken
from
paintings
by
one
garnery
respectively
they
represent
attacks
on
the
sperm
and
right
whale
in
the
first
engraving
a
noble
sperm
whale
is
depicted
in
full
majesty
of
might
just
risen
beneath
the
boat
from
the
profundities
of
the
ocean
and
bearing
high
in
the
air
upon
his
back
the
terrific
wreck
of
the
stoven
planks
the
prow
of
the
boat
is
partially
unbroken
and
is
drawn
just
balancing
upon
the
monster’s
spine
and
standing
in
that
prow
for
that
one
single
incomputable
flash
of
time
you
behold
an
oarsman
half
shrouded
by
the
incensed
boiling
spout
of
the
whale
and
in
the
act
of
leaping
as
if
from
a
precipice
the
action
of
the
whole
thing
is
wonderfully
good
and
true
the
half-emptied
line-tub
floats
on
the
whitened
sea
the
wooden
poles
of
the
spilled
harpoons
obliquely
bob
in
it
the
heads
of
the
swimming
crew
are
scattered
about
the
whale
in
contrasting
expressions
of
affright
while
in
the
black
stormy
distance
the
ship
is
bearing
down
upon
the
scene
serious
fault
might
be
found
with
the
anatomical
details
of
this
whale
but
let
that
pass
since
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
draw
so
good
a
one
in
the
second
engraving
the
boat
is
in
the
act
of
drawing
alongside
the
barnacled
flank
of
a
large
running
right
whale
that
rolls
his
black
weedy
bulk
in
the
sea
like
some
mossy
rock-slide
from
the
patagonian
cliffs
his
jets
are
erect
full
and
black
like
soot
so
that
from
so
abounding
a
smoke
in
the
chimney
you
would
think
there
must
be
a
brave
supper
cooking
in
the
great
bowels
below
sea
fowls
are
pecking
at
the
small
crabs
shell-fish
and
other
sea
candies
and
maccaroni
which
the
right
whale
sometimes
carries
on
his
pestilent
back
and
all
the
while
the
thick-lipped
leviathan
is
rushing
through

very
fine

to
its

the

who
secure
from

like

sluggishly
swam
through

known

as

does
not
bear
that

do
because
of

because

this

very
well
be

the

the

the

held
on

north-eastward
towards
the

a

impelling
her

so
that
in
the

her
three
tall

mildly
waved
to

as

on

still
at

in

the

would
be

one
transparent
blue
morning
when
a
stillness
almost
preternatural
spread
over
the
sea
however
unattended
with
any
stagnant
calm
when
the
long
burnished
sun-glade
on
the
waters
seemed
a
golden
finger
laid
across
them
enjoining
some
secrecy
when
the
slippered
waves
whispered
together
as
they
softly
ran
on
in
this
profound
hush
of
the
visible
sphere
a
strange
spectre
was
seen
by
daggoo
from
the
main-mast-head
in
the
distance
a
great
white
mass
lazily
rose
and
rising
higher
and
higher
and
disentangling
itself
from
the
azure
at
last
gleamed
before
our
prow
like
a
snow-slide
new
slid
from
the
hills
thus
glistening
for
a
moment
as
slowly
it
subsided
and
sank
then
once
more
arose
and
silently
gleamed
it
seemed
not
a
whale
and
yet
is
this
moby

daggoo
again
the
phantom
went
down
but
on
re-appearing
once
more
with
a
stiletto-like
cry
that
startled
every
man
from
his
nod
the
negro
yelled
out—“there
there
again
there
she
breaches
right
ahead
the
white
whale
the
white
whale!”
upon
this
the
seamen
rushed
to
the
yard-arms
as
in
swarming-time
the
bees
rush
to
the
boughs

the

ahab
stood
on
the
bowsprit
and
with
one
hand
pushed
far
behind
in
readiness
to
wave
his
orders
to
the
helmsman
cast
his
eager
glance
in
the
direction
indicated
aloft
by
the
outstretched
motionless
arm
of
daggoo
whether
the
flitting
attendance
of
the
one
still
and
solitary
jet
had
gradually
worked
upon
ahab
so
that
he
was
now
prepared
to
connect
the
ideas
of
mildness
and
repose
with
the
first
sight
of
the
particular
whale
he
pursued
however
this
was
or
whether
his
eagerness
betrayed
him
whichever
way
it
might
have
been
no
sooner
did
he
distinctly
perceive
the
white
mass
than
with
a
quick
intensity
he
instantly
gave
orders
for
lowering
the
four
boats
were
soon
on
the
water
ahab’s
in
advance
and
all
swiftly
pulling
towards
their
prey
soon
it
went
down
and
while
with
oars
suspended
we
were
awaiting
its
reappearance
lo
in
the
same
spot
where
it
sank
once
more
it
slowly
rose
almost
forgetting
for
the
moment
all
thoughts
of
moby
dick
we
now
gazed
at
the
most
wondrous
phenomenon
which
the
secret
seas
have
hitherto
revealed
to
mankind
a
vast
pulpy
mass
furlongs
in
length
and
breadth
of
a
glancing
cream-colour
lay
floating
on
the
water
innumerable
long
arms
radiating
from
its
centre
and
curling
and
twisting
like
a
nest
of
anacondas
as
if
blindly
to
clutch
at
any
hapless
object
within
reach
no
perceptible
face
or
front
did
it
have
no
conceivable
token
of
either
sensation
or
instinct
but
undulated
there
on
the
billows
an
unearthly
formless
chance-like
apparition
of
life
as
with
a
low
sucking
sound
it
slowly
disappeared
again
starbuck
still
gazing
at
the
agitated
waters
where
it
had
sunk
with
a
wild
voice
exclaimed—“almost
rather
had
i
seen
moby
dick
and
fought
him
than
to
have
seen
thee
thou
white
ghost!”
“what
was
it
sir?”
said
flask
“the
great
live
squid
which
they
say
few
whale-ships
ever
beheld
and
returned
to
their
ports
to
tell
of
it.”
but
ahab
said
nothing
turning
his
boat
he
sailed
back
to
the
vessel
the
rest
as
silently
following
whatever
superstitions
the
sperm
whalemen
in
general
have
connected
with
the
sight
of
this
object
certain
it
is
that
a
glimpse
of
it
being
so
very
unusual
that
circumstance
has
gone
far
to
invest
it
with
portentousness
so
rarely
is
it
beheld
that
though
one
and
all
of
them
declare
it
to
be
the
largest
animated
thing
in
the
ocean
yet
very
few
of
them
have
any
but
the
most
vague
ideas
concerning
its
true
nature
and
form
notwithstanding
they
believe
it
to
furnish
to
the
sperm
whale
his
only
food
for
though
other
species
of
whales
find
their
food
above
water
and
may
be
seen
by
man
in
the
act
of
feeding
the
spermaceti
whale
obtains
his
whole
food
in
unknown
zones
below
the
surface
and
only
by
inference
is
it
that
any
one
can
tell
of
what
precisely
that
food
consists
at
times
when
closely
pursued
he
will
disgorge
what
are
supposed
to
be
the
detached
arms
of
the
squid
some
of
them
thus
exhibited
exceeding
twenty
and
thirty
feet
in
length
they
fancy
that
the
monster
to
which
these
arms
belonged
ordinarily
clings
by
them
to
the
bed
of
the
ocean
and
that
the
sperm
whale
unlike
other
species
is
supplied
with
teeth
in
order
to
attack
and
tear
it
there
seems
some
ground
to
imagine
that
the
great
kraken
of
bishop
pontoppodan
may
ultimately
resolve
itself
into
squid
the
manner
in
which
the
bishop
describes
it
as
alternately
rising
and
sinking
with
some
other
particulars
he
narrates
in
all
this
the
two
correspond
but
much
abatement
is
necessary
with
respect
to
the
incredible
bulk
he
assigns
it
by
some
naturalists
who
have
vaguely
heard
rumors
of
the
mysterious
creature
here
spoken
of
it

to

for
the
better
understanding
of
all
similar
scenes
elsewhere
presented
i
have
here
to
speak
of
the
magical
sometimes
horrible
whale-line
the
line
originally
used
in
the
fishery
was
of
the
best
hemp
slightly
vapored
with
tar
not
impregnated
with
it
as
in
the
case
of
ordinary
ropes
for
while
tar
as
ordinarily
used
makes
the
hemp
more
pliable
to
the
rope-maker
and
also
renders
the
rope
itself
more
convenient
to
the
sailor
for
common
ship
use
yet
not
only
would
the
ordinary
quantity
too
much
stiffen
the
whale-line
for
the
close
coiling
to
which
it
must
be
subjected
but
as
most
seamen
are
beginning
to
learn
tar
in
general
by
no
means
adds
to
the
rope’s
durability
or
strength
however
much
it
may
give
it
compactness
and
gloss
of
late
years
the
manilla
rope
has
in
the
american
fishery
almost
entirely
superseded
hemp
as
a
material
for
whale-lines
for
though
not
so
durable
as
hemp
it
is
stronger
and
far
more
soft
and
elastic
and
i
will
add
since
there
is
an
æsthetics
in
all
things
is
much
more
handsome
and
becoming
to
the
boat
than
hemp
hemp
is
a
dusky
dark

a
sort
of
indian
but
manilla
is
as
a
golden-haired
circassian
to
behold
the
whale-line
is
only
two-thirds
of
an
inch
in
thickness
at
first
sight
you
would
not
think
it
so
strong
as
it
really
is
by
experiment
its
one
and
fifty
yarns
will
each
suspend
a
weight
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
so
that
the
whole
rope
will
bear
a
strain
nearly
equal
to
three
tons
in
length
the
common
sperm
whale-line
measures
something
over
two
hundred
fathoms
towards
the
stern
of
the
boat
it
is
spirally
coiled
away
in
the
tub
not
like
the
worm-pipe
of
a
still
though
but
so
as
to
form
one
round
cheese-shaped
mass
of
densely
bedded
“sheaves,”
or
layers
of
concentric
spiralizations
without
any
hollow
but
the
“heart,”
or
minute
vertical
tube
formed
at
the
axis
of
the
cheese
as
the
least
tangle
or
kink

in
running
out
infallibly
take
somebody’s
arm

or
entire
body
off
the
utmost
precaution
is
used
in
stowing
the
line
in
its
tub
some
harpooneers
will
consume
almost
an
entire
morning
in
this
business
carrying
the
line
high
aloft
and
then
reeving
it
downwards
through
a
block
towards
the
tub
so
as
in
the
act
of
coiling
to
free
it
from
all
possible
wrinkles
and
twists
in
the
english
boats
two
tubs
are
used
instead
of
one
the
same
line
being
continuously
coiled
in
both
tubs
there
is
some
advantage
in
this
because
these
twin-tubs
being
so
small
they
fit
more
readily
into
the
boat
and
do
not
strain
it
so
much
whereas
the
american
tub
nearly
three
feet
in
diameter
and
of
proportionate
depth
makes
a
rather
bulky
freight
for
a
craft
whose
planks
are
but
one
half-inch
in
thickness
for
the
bottom
of
the
whale-boat
is
like
critical
ice
which
will
bear
up
a
considerable
distributed
weight
but
not
very
much
of
a
concentrated
one
when
the
painted
canvas
cover
is
clapped
on
the
american
line-tub
the
boat
looks
as
if
it
were
pulling
off
with
a
prodigious
great
wedding-cake
to
present
to
the

both
ends
of
the
line
are
exposed
the
lower
end
terminating
in
an
eye-splice
or
loop
coming
up
from
the
bottom
against
the
side
of
the
tub
and
hanging
over
its
edge
completely
disengaged
from
everything
this
arrangement
of
the
lower
end
is
necessary
on
two
accounts
first
in
order
to
facilitate
the
fastening
to
it
of
an
additional
line
from
a
neighboring
boat
in
case
the
stricken
whale
should
sound
so
deep
as
to
threaten
to
carry
off
the
entire
line
originally
attached
to
the
harpoon
in
these
instances
the
whale
of
course
is
shifted
like
a
mug
of
ale
as
it
were
from
the
one
boat
to
the
other
though
the
first
boat
always
hovers
at
hand
to
assist
its

second
this
arrangement
is
indispensable
for
common
safety’s
sake
for
were
the
lower
end
of
the
line
in
any
way
attached
to
the
boat
and
were
the
whale
then
to
run
the
line
out
to
the
end
almost
in
a
single
smoking
minute
as
he
sometimes
does
he
would
not
stop
there
for
the
doomed
boat
would
infallibly
be
dragged
down
after
him
into
the
profundity
of
the
sea
and
in
that
case
no
town-crier
would
ever
find
her
again
before
lowering
the
boat
for
the
chase
the
upper
end
of
the
line
is
taken
aft
from
the
tub
and
passing
round
the
loggerhead
there
is
again
carried
forward
the
entire
length
of
the
boat
resting
crosswise
upon
the
loom
or
handle
of
every
man’s
oar
so
that
it
jogs
against
his
wrist
in
rowing
and
also
passing
between
the
men
as
they
alternately
sit
at
the
opposite
gunwales
to
the
leaded
chocks
or
grooves
in
the
extreme
pointed
prow
of
the
boat
where
a
wooden
pin
or
skewer
the
size
of
a
common
quill
prevents
it
from
slipping
out
from
the
chocks
it
hangs
in
a
slight
festoon
over
the
bows
and
is
then
passed
inside
the
boat
again
and
some
ten
or
twenty
fathoms
called
box-line
being
coiled
upon
the
box
in
the
bows
it
continues
its
way
to
the
gunwale
still
a
little
further
aft
and
is
then
attached
to
the
short-warp—the
rope
which
is
immediately
connected
with
the
harpoon
but
previous
to
that
connexion
the
short-warp
goes
through
sundry
mystifications
too
tedious
to
detail
thus
the
whale-line
folds
the
whole
boat
in
its
complicated
coils
twisting
and
writhing
around
it
in
almost
every
direction
all
the
oarsmen
are
involved
in
its
perilous
contortions
so
that
to
the
timid
eye
of
the
landsman
they
seem
as
indian
jugglers
with
the
deadliest
snakes
sportively
festooning
their
limbs
nor
can
any
son
of
mortal
woman
for
the
first
time
seat
himself
amid
those
hempen
intricacies
and
while
straining
his
utmost
at
the
oar
bethink
him
that
at
any
unknown
instant
the
harpoon
may
be
darted
and
all
these
horrible
contortions
be
put
in
play
like
ringed
lightnings
he
cannot
be
thus
circumstanced
without
a
shudder
that
makes
the
very

in

to
quiver

whizzings
of
a
steam-engine
in
full
play
when
every
flying
beam
and
shaft
and
wheel
is
grazing
you
it
is
worse
for
you
cannot
sit
motionless
in
the
heart
of
these
perils
because
the
boat
is
rocking
like
a
cradle
and
you
are
pitched
one
way
and
the
other
without
the
slightest
warning
and
only
by
a
certain
self-adjusting
buoyancy
and
simultaneousness
of
volition
and
action
can
you
escape
being
made
a
mazeppa
of
and
run
away
with
where
the
all-seeing
sun
himself
could
never
pierce
you
out
again
as
the
profound
calm
which
only
apparently
precedes
and
prophesies
of
the
storm
is
perhaps
more
awful
than
the
storm
itself
for
indeed
the
calm
is
but
the
wrapper
and
envelope
of
the
storm
and
contains
it
in
itself
as
the
seemingly
harmless
rifle
holds
the
fatal
powder
and
the
ball
and
the
explosion
so
the
graceful
repose
of
the
line
as
it
silently
serpentines
about
the
oarsmen
before
being
brought
into
actual
play—this
is
a
thing
which
carries
more
of
true
terror
than
any
other
aspect
of
this
dangerous
affair
but
why
say
more
all
men
live
enveloped
in
whale-lines
all
are
born
with
halters
round
their
necks
but
it
is
only
when
caught
in
the
swift
sudden
turn
of
death
that
mortals
realize
the
silent
subtle
ever-present
perils
of
life
and
if
you
be
a
philosopher
though
seated
in
the
whale-boat
you
would
not
at
heart
feel
one
whit
more
of
terror
than

noticed
that
the
seamen
at
the
main
and
mizzen-mast-heads
were
already
drowsy
so
that
at
last
all
three
of
us
lifelessly
swung
from
the
spars
and
for
every
swing
that
we
made
there
was
a
nod
from
below
from
the
slumbering
helmsman
the
waves
too
nodded
their
indolent
crests
and
across
the
wide
trance
of
the
sea
east
nodded
to
west
and
the
sun
over
all
suddenly
bubbles
seemed
bursting
beneath
my
closed
eyes
like
vices
my
hands
grasped
the
shrouds
some
invisible
gracious
agency
preserved
me
with
a
shock
i
came
back
to
life
and
lo
close
under
our
lee
not
forty
fathoms
off
a
gigantic
sperm
whale
lay
rolling
in
the
water
like
the
capsized
hull
of
a
frigate
his
broad
glossy
back
of
an
ethiopian
hue
glistening
in
the
sun’s
rays
like
a
mirror
but
lazily
undulating
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
and
ever
and
anon
tranquilly
spouting
his
vapory
jet
the
whale
looked
like
a
portly
burgher
smoking
his
pipe
of
a
warm
afternoon
but
that
pipe
poor
whale
was
thy
last
as
if
struck
by
some
enchanter’s
wand
the
sleepy
ship
and
every
sleeper
in
it
all
at
once
started
into
wakefulness
and
more
than
a
score
of
voices
from
all
parts
of
the
vessel
simultaneously
with
the
three
notes
from
aloft
shouted
forth
the
accustomed
cry
as
the
great
fish
slowly
and
regularly
spouted
the
sparkling
brine
into
the
air
“clear
away
the
boats
luff!”
cried
ahab
and
obeying
his
own
order
he
dashed
the
helm
down
before
the
helmsman
could
handle
the
spokes
the
sudden
exclamations
of
the
crew
must
have
alarmed
the
whale
and
ere
the
boats
were
down
majestically
turning
he
swam
away
to
the
leeward
but
with
such
a
steady
tranquillity
and
making
so
few
ripples
as
he
swam
that
thinking
after
all
he
might
not
as
yet
be
alarmed
ahab
gave
orders
that
not
an
oar
should
be
used
and
no
man
must
speak
but
in
whispers
so
seated
like
ontario
indians
on
the
gunwales
of
the
boats
we
swiftly
but
silently
paddled
along
the
calm
not
admitting
of
the
noiseless
sails
being
set
presently
as
we
thus
glided
in
chase
the
monster
perpendicularly
flitted
his
tail
forty
feet
into
the
air
and
then
sank
out
of
sight
like
a
tower
swallowed
up
“there
go
flukes!”
was
the
cry
an
announcement
immediately
followed
by
stubb’s
producing
his
match
and
igniting
his
pipe
for
now
a
respite
was
granted
after
the
full
interval
of
his
sounding
had
elapsed
the
whale
rose
again
and
being
now
in
advance
of
the
smoker’s
boat
and
much
nearer
to
it
than
to
any
of
the
others
stubb
counted
upon
the
honor
of
the
capture
it
was
obvious
now
that
the
whale
had
at
length
become
aware
of
his
pursuers
all
silence
of
cautiousness
was
therefore
no
longer
of
use
paddles
were
dropped
and
oars
came
loudly
into
play
and
still
puffing
at
his
pipe
stubb
cheered
on
his
crew
to
the
assault
yes
a
mighty
change
had
come
over
the
fish
all
alive
to
his
jeopardy
he
was
going
“head
out”
that
part
obliquely
projecting
from
the
mad
yeast
which
he
brewed.*
*it
will
be
seen
in
some
other
place
of
what
a
very
light
substance
the
entire
interior
of
the
sperm
whale’s
enormous
head
consists
though
apparently
the
most
massive
it
is
by
far
the
most
buoyant
part
about
him
so
that
with
ease
he
elevates
it
in
the
air
and
invariably
does
so
when
going
at
his
utmost
speed
besides
such
is
the
breadth
of
the
upper
part
of
the
front
of
his
head
and
such
the
tapering
cut-water
formation
of
the
lower
part
that
by
obliquely
elevating
his
head
he
thereby
may
be
said
to
transform
himself
from
a
bluff-bowed
sluggish
galliot
into
a
sharppointed
new
york
pilot-boat
“start
her
start
her
my
men
don’t
hurry
yourselves
take
plenty
of
time—but
start
her
start
her
like
thunder-claps
that’s
all,”
cried
stubb
spluttering
out
the
smoke
as
he
spoke
“start
her
now
give
’em
the
long
and
strong
stroke
tashtego
start
her
tash
my
boy—start
her
all
but
keep
cool
keep
cool—cucumbers
is
the
word—easy
easy—only
start
her
like
grim
death
and
grinning
devils
and
raise
the
buried
dead
perpendicular
out
of
their
graves
boys—that’s
all
start
her!”
“woo-hoo
wa-hee!”
screamed
the
gay-header
in
reply
raising
some
old
war-whoop
to
the
skies
as
every
oarsman
in
the
strained
boat
involuntarily
bounced
forward
with
the
one
tremendous
leading
stroke
which
the
eager
indian
gave
but
his
wild
screams
were
answered
by
others
quite
as
wild
“kee-hee
kee-hee!”
yelled
daggoo
straining
forwards
and
backwards
on
his
seat
like
a
pacing
tiger
in
his
cage
“ka-la
koo-loo!”
howled
queequeg
as
if
smacking
his
lips
over
a
mouthful
of
grenadier’s
steak
and
thus
with
oars
and
yells
the
keels
cut
the
sea
meanwhile
stubb
retaining
his
place
in
the
van
still
encouraged
his
men
to
the
onset
all
the
while
puffing
the
smoke
from
his
mouth
like
desperadoes
they
tugged
and
they
strained
till
the
welcome
cry
was
heard—“stand
up
tashtego!—give
it
to
him!”
the
harpoon
was
hurled
“stern
all!”
the
oarsmen
backed
water
the
same
moment
something
went
hot
and
hissing
along
every
one
of
their
wrists
it
was
the
magical
line
an
instant
before
stubb
had
swiftly
caught
two
additional
turns
with
it
round
the
loggerhead
whence
by
reason
of
its
increased
rapid
circlings
a
hempen
blue
smoke
now
jetted
up
and
mingled
with
the
steady
fumes
from
his
pipe
as
the
line
passed
round
and
round
the
loggerhead
so
also
just
before
reaching
that
point
it
blisteringly
passed
through
and
through
both
of
stubb’s
hands
from
which
the
hand-cloths
or
squares
of
quilted
canvas
sometimes
worn
at
these
times
had
accidentally
dropped
it
was
like
holding
an
enemy’s
sharp
two-edged
sword
by
the
blade
and
that
enemy
all
the
time
striving
to
wrest
it
out
of
your
clutch
“wet
the
line
wet
the
line!”
cried
stubb
to
the
tub
oarsman
him
seated
by
the
tub
who
snatching
off
his
hat
dashed
sea-water
into
it.*
more
turns
were
taken
so
that
the
line
began
holding
its
place
the
boat
now
flew
through
the
boiling
water
like
a
shark
all
fins
stubb
and
tashtego
here
changed
places—stem
for
stern—a
staggering
business
truly
in
that
rocking
commotion
*partly
to
show
the
indispensableness
of
this
act
it
may
here
be
stated
that
in
the
old
dutch
fishery
a
mop
was
used
to
dash
the
running
line
with
water
in
many
other
ships
a
wooden
piggin
or
bailer
is
set
apart
for
that
purpose
your
hat
however
is
the
most
convenient
from
the
vibrating
line
extending
the
entire
length
of
the
upper
part
of
the
boat
and
from
its
now
being
more
tight
than
a
harpstring
you
would
have
thought
the
craft
had
two
keels—one
cleaving
the
water
the
other
the
air—as
the
boat
churned
on
through
both
opposing
elements
at
once
a
continual
cascade
played
at
the
bows
a
ceaseless
whirling
eddy
in
her
wake
and
at
the
slightest
motion
from
within
even
but
of
a
little
finger
the
vibrating
cracking
craft
canted
over
her
spasmodic
gunwale
into
the
sea
thus
they
rushed
each
man
with
might
and
main
clinging
to
his
seat
to
prevent
being
tossed
to
the
foam
and
the
tall
form
of
tashtego
at
the
steering
oar
crouching
almost
double
in
order
to
bring
down
his
centre
of
gravity
whole
atlantics
and
pacifics
seemed
passed
as
they
shot
on
their
way
till
at
length
the
whale
somewhat
slackened
his
flight
“haul
in—haul
in!”
cried
stubb
to
the
bowsman
and
facing
round
towards
the
whale
all
hands
began
pulling
the
boat
up
to
him
while
yet
the
boat
was
being
towed
on

ranging
up
by
his
flank
stubb
firmly
planting
his
knee
in
the
clumsy
cleat
darted

after

into
the
flying
fish
at
the
word
of
command
the
boat
alternately
sterning
out
of
the
way
of
the
whale’s
horrible
wallow
and
then
ranging
up
for
another
fling
the
red
tide
now
poured
from
all
sides
of
the
monster
like
brooks
down
a
hill
his
tormented
body
rolled
not
in
brine
but
in
blood
which
bubbled
and
seethed
for
furlongs
behind
in
their
wake
the
slanting
sun
playing
upon
this
crimson
pond
in
the
sea
sent
back
its
reflection
into
every
face
so
that
they
all
glowed
to
each
other
like
red
men
and
all
the
while
jet
after
jet
of
white
smoke
was
agonizingly
shot
from
the
spiracle
of
the

and
vehement
puff
after

from
the
mouth
of
the
excited
headsman
as
at
every
dart
hauling
in
upon
his
crooked
lance
by
the
line
attached
to
it
stubb
straightened
it
again
and
again
by
a
few
rapid
blows
against
the
gunwale
then
again
and
again
sent
it
into
the
whale
“pull
up—pull
up!”
he
now
cried
to
the
bowsman
as
the
waning
whale
relaxed
in
his
wrath
“pull
up!—close
to!”
and
the
boat
ranged
along
the
fish’s
flank
when
reaching
far
over
the
bow
stubb
slowly
churned
his
long
sharp
lance
into
the
fish
and
kept
it
there
carefully
churning
and
churning
as
if
cautiously
seeking
to
feel
after
some
gold
watch
that
the
whale
might
have
swallowed
and
which
he
was
fearful
of
breaking
ere
he
could
hook
it
out
but
that
gold
watch
he
sought
was
the
innermost
life
of
the
fish
and
now
it
is
struck
for
starting
from
his
trance
into
that
unspeakable
thing
called
his
“flurry,”
the
monster
horribly
wallowed
in
his
blood
overwrapped
himself
in
impenetrable
mad
boiling
spray
so
that
the
imperilled
craft
instantly
dropping
astern
had
much
ado
blindly
to
struggle
out
from
that
phrensied
twilight
into
the
clear
air
of
the
day
and
now
abating
in
his
flurry
the
whale
once
more
rolled
out
into
view
surging
from
side
to
side
spasmodically
dilating
and
contracting
his
spout-hole
with
sharp
cracking
agonized
respirations
at
last
gush
after
gush
of
clotted
red
gore
as
if
it
had
been
the
purple
lees
of
red
wine
shot
into
the
frighted
air
and
falling
back
again
ran
dripping
down
his
motionless
flanks
into
the
sea
his
heart
had
burst
“he’s
dead
mr
stubb,”
said
daggoo
“yes
both
pipes
smoked
out!”
and
withdrawing
his
own
from
his
mouth
stubb
scattered
the
dead
ashes
over
the
water
and
for
a
moment
stood
thoughtfully
eyeing
the
vast
corpse
he
had
made

and
the

pulling

now
it

to

for

in

by

no

actually
burst

no

that

are

no

that
to
many

owners
whaling
is

a

concern
for
it
is
the
harpooneer
that
makes
the
voyage
and
if
you
take

out
of

body
how
can
you
expect
to
find
it
there
when

again

then
at

critical

that
is

start

but
all
this
is
both

the

should
stay
in

he
should
both
dart

loss
of

in

but
long
experience
in
various
whalemen
of
more
than

nation
has
convinced
me
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
failures
in
the
fishery
it
has
not
by
any
means
been
so
much
the
speed
of
the

the
before

of
the

that
has
caused
them
to
insure
the
greatest
efficiency
in

the

the
crotch
out

out
of
them
the
twigs
so
in
productive
subjects
grow
the
chapters
the
crotch
alluded
to
on
a
previous
page
deserves
independent
mention
it
is
a
notched
stick
of
a
peculiar
form
some
two
feet
in
length
which
is
perpendicularly
inserted
into
the
starboard
gunwale
near
the
bow
for
the
purpose
of
furnishing
a
rest
for
the
wooden
extremity
of
the
harpoon
whose
other
naked
barbed
end
slopingly
projects
from
the
prow
thereby
the
weapon
is
instantly
at
hand
to
its
hurler
who
snatches
it
up
as
readily
from
its
rest
as
a
backwoodsman
swings
his
rifle
from
the
wall
it
is
customary
to
have
two
harpoons
reposing
in
the
crotch
respectively
called
the
first
and
second
irons
but
these
two
harpoons
each
by
its
own
cord
are
both
connected
with
the
line
the
object
being
this
to
dart
them
both
if
possible
one
instantly
after
the
other
into
the
same
whale
so
that
if
in
the
coming
drag
one
should
draw
out
the
other
may
still
retain
a
hold
it
is
a
doubling
of
the
chances
but
it
very
often
happens
that
owing
to
the
instantaneous
violent
convulsive
running
of
the
whale
upon
receiving
the
first
iron
it
becomes
impossible
for
the
harpooneer
however
lightning-like
in
his
movements
to
pitch
the
second
iron
into
him
nevertheless
as
the
second
iron
is
already
connected
with
the
line
and
the
line
is
running
hence
that
weapon
must
at
all
events
be
anticipatingly
tossed
out
of
the
boat
somehow
and
somewhere
else
the
most
terrible
jeopardy
would
involve
all
hands

into
the
water
it
accordingly
is
in
such
cases
the
spare
coils
of
box
line
mentioned
in
a
preceding
chapter
making
this
feat
in
most
instances
prudently
practicable
but
this
critical
act
is
not
always
unattended

the
saddest
and
most
fatal
casualties
furthermore
you
must
know
that
when

it
thenceforth
becomes
a
dangling
sharp-edged
terror
skittishly
curvetting
about
both
boat
and
whale
entangling
the
lines
or
cutting
them
and
making
a
prodigious
sensation
in
all
directions
nor
in
general
is
it
possible
to
secure
it
again
until
the
whale
is
fairly
captured

a
corpse

now
how
it
must
be
in
the
case
of
four
boats
all
engaging
one
unusually
strong
active
and
knowing
whale
when
owing
to
these
qualities
in
him
as
well
as
to
the
thousand
concurring
accidents
of
such
an
audacious
enterprise
eight
or
ten
loose

irons
may
be
simultaneously
dangling
about
him

boat
is

with
several

on
to

chapter
64
stubb’s
supper
stubb’s
whale
had
been
killed
some
distance
from
the
ship
it
was
a
calm
so
forming
a
tandem
of
three
boats
we
commenced
the
slow
business
of
towing
the
trophy
to
the
pequod
and
now
as
we
eighteen
men
with
our
thirty-six
arms
and
one
hundred
and
eighty
thumbs
and
fingers
slowly
toiled
hour
after
hour
upon
that
inert
sluggish
corpse
in
the
sea
and
it
seemed
hardly
to
budge
at
all
except
at
long
intervals
good
evidence
was
hereby
furnished
of
the
enormousness
of
the
mass
we
moved
for
upon
the
great
canal
of
hang-ho
or
whatever
they
call
it
in
china
four
or
five
laborers
on
the
foot-path
will
draw
a
bulky
freighted
junk
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
an
hour
but
this
grand
argosy
we
towed
heavily
forged
along
as
if
laden
with
pig-lead
in
bulk
darkness
came
on
but
three
lights
up
and
down
in
the
pequod’s
main-rigging
dimly
guided
our
way
till
drawing
nearer
we
saw
ahab
dropping
one
of
several
more
lanterns
over
the
bulwarks
vacantly
eyeing
the
heaving
whale
for
a
moment
he
issued
the
usual
orders
for
securing
it
for
the
night
and
then
handing
his
lantern
to
a
seaman
went
his
way
into
the
cabin
and
did
not
come
forward
again
until
morning
though
in
overseeing
the
pursuit
of
this
whale
captain
ahab
had
evinced
his
customary
activity
to
call
it
so
yet
now
that
the
creature
was
dead
some
vague
dissatisfaction
or
impatience
or
despair
seemed
working
in
him
as
if
the
sight
of
that
dead
body
reminded
him
that
moby
dick
was
yet
to
be
slain
and
though
a
thousand
other
whales
were
brought
to
his
ship
all
that
would
not
one
jot
advance
his
grand
monomaniac
object
very
soon
you
would
have
thought
from
the
sound
on
the
pequod’s
decks
that
all
hands
were
preparing
to
cast
anchor
in
the
deep
for
heavy
chains
are
being
dragged
along
the
deck
and
thrust
rattling
out
of
the
port-holes
but
by
those
clanking
links
the
vast
corpse
itself
not
the
ship
is
to
be
moored
tied
by
the
head
to
the
stern
and
by
the
tail
to
the
bows
the
whale
now
lies
with
its
black
hull
close
to
the
vessel’s
and
seen
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
which
obscured
the
spars
and
rigging
aloft
the
two—ship
and
whale
seemed
yoked
together
like
colossal
bullocks
whereof
one
reclines
while
the
other
remains
standing.*
*a
little
item
may
as
well
be
related
here
the
strongest
and
most
reliable
hold
which
the
ship
has
upon
the
whale
when
moored
alongside
is
by
the
flukes
or
tail
and
as
from
its
greater
density
that
part
is
relatively
heavier
than
any
other
excepting
the
side-fins
its
flexibility
even
in
death
causes
it
to
sink
low
beneath
the
surface
so
that
with
the
hand
you
cannot
get
at
it
from
the
boat
in
order
to
put
the
chain
round
it
but
this
difficulty
is
ingeniously
overcome
a
small
strong
line
is
prepared
with
a
wooden
float
at
its
outer
end
and
a
weight
in
its
middle
while
the
other
end
is
secured
to
the
ship
by
adroit
management
the
wooden
float
is
made
to
rise
on
the
other
side
of
the
mass
so
that
now
having
girdled
the
whale
the
chain
is
readily
made
to
follow
suit
and
being
slipped
along
the
body
is
at
last
locked
fast
round
the
smallest
part
of
the
tail
at
the
point
of
junction
with
its
broad
flukes
or
lobes
if
moody
ahab
was
now
all
quiescence
at
least
so
far
as
could
be
known
on
deck
stubb
his
second
mate
flushed
with
conquest
betrayed
an
unusual
but
still
good-natured
excitement
such
an
unwonted
bustle
was
he
in
that
the
staid
starbuck
his
official
superior
quietly
resigned
to
him
for
the
time
the
sole
management
of
affairs
one
small
helping
cause
of
all
this
liveliness
in
stubb
was
soon
made
strangely
manifest
stubb
was
a
high
liver
he
was
somewhat
intemperately
fond
of
the
whale
as
a
flavorish
thing
to
his
palate
“a
steak
a
steak
ere
i
sleep
you
daggoo
overboard
you
go
and
cut
me
one
from
his
small!”
here
be
it
known
that
though
these
wild
fishermen
do
not
as
a
general
thing
and
according
to
the
great
military
maxim
make
the
enemy
defray
the
current
expenses
of
the
war
at
least
before
realizing
the
proceeds
of
the
voyage
yet
now
and
then
you
find
some
of
these
nantucketers
who
have
a
genuine
relish
for
that
particular
part
of
the
sperm
whale
designated
by
stubb
comprising
the
tapering
extremity
of
the
body
about
midnight
that
steak
was
cut
and
cooked
and
lighted
by
two
lanterns
of
sperm
oil
stubb
stoutly
stood
up
to
his
spermaceti
supper
at
the
capstan-head
as
if
that
capstan
were
a
sideboard
nor
was
stubb
the
only
banqueter
on
whale’s
flesh
that
night
mingling
their
mumblings
with
his
own
mastications
thousands
on
thousands
of
sharks
swarming
round
the
dead
leviathan
smackingly
feasted
on
its
fatness
the
few
sleepers
below
in
their
bunks
were
often
startled
by
the
sharp
slapping
of
their
tails
against
the
hull
within
a
few
inches
of
the
sleepers’
hearts
peering
over
the
side
you
could
just
see
them
as
before
you
heard
them
wallowing
in
the
sullen
black
waters
and
turning
over
on
their
backs
as
they
scooped
out
huge
globular
pieces
of
the
whale
of
the
bigness
of
a
human
head
this
particular
feat
of
the
shark
seems
all
but
miraculous
how
at
such
an
apparently
unassailable
surface
they
contrive
to
gouge
out
such
symmetrical
mouthfuls
remains
a
part
of
the
universal
problem
of
all
things
the
mark
they
thus
leave
on
the
whale
may
best
be
likened
to
the
hollow
made
by
a
carpenter
in
countersinking
for
a
screw
though
amid
all
the
smoking
horror
and
diabolism
of
a
sea-fight
sharks
will
be
seen
longingly
gazing
up
to
the
ship’s
decks
like
hungry
dogs
round
a
table
where
red
meat
is
being
carved
ready
to
bolt
down
every
killed
man
that
is
tossed
to
them
and
though
while
the
valiant
butchers
over
the
deck-table
are
thus
cannibally
carving
each
other’s
live
meat
with
carving-knives
all
gilded
and
tasselled
the
sharks
also
with
their
jewel-hilted
mouths
are
quarrelsomely
carving
away
under
the
table
at
the
dead
meat
and
though
were
you
to
turn
the
whole
affair
upside
down
it
would
still
be
pretty
much
the
same
thing
that
is
to
say
a
shocking
sharkish
business
enough
for
all
parties
and
though
sharks
also
are
the
invariable
outriders
of
all
slave
ships
crossing
the
atlantic
systematically
trotting
alongside
to
be
handy
in
case
a
parcel
is
to
be
carried
anywhere
or
a
dead
slave
to
be
decently
buried
and
though
one
or
two
other
like
instances
might
be
set
down
touching
the
set
terms
places
and
occasions
when
sharks
do
most
socially
congregate
and
most
hilariously
feast
yet
is
there
no
conceivable
time
or
occasion
when
you
will
find
them
in
such
countless
numbers
and
in
gayer
or
more
jovial
spirits
than
around
a
dead
sperm
whale
moored
by
night
to
a
whaleship
at
sea
if
you
have
never
seen
that
sight
then
suspend
your
decision
about
the
propriety
of
devil-worship
and
the
expediency
of
conciliating
the
devil
but
as
yet
stubb
heeded
not
the
mumblings
of
the
banquet
that
was
going
on
so
nigh
him
no
more
than
the
sharks
heeded
the
smacking
of
his
own
epicurean
lips
“cook
cook!—where’s
that
old
fleece?”
he
cried
at
length
widening
his
legs
still
further
as
if
to
form
a
more
secure
base
for
his
supper
and
at
the
same
time
darting
his
fork
into
the
dish
as
if
stabbing
with
his
lance
“cook
you
cook!—sail
this
way
cook!”
the
old
black
not
in
any
very
high
glee
at
having
been
previously
roused
from
his
warm
hammock
at
a
most
unseasonable
hour
came
shambling
along
from
his
galley
for
like
many
old
blacks
there
was
something
the
matter
with
his
knee-pans
which
he
did
not
keep
well
scoured
like
his
other
pans
this
old
fleece
as
they
called
him
came
shuffling
and
limping
along
assisting
his
step
with
his
tongs
which
after
a
clumsy
fashion
were
made
of
straightened
iron
hoops
this
old
ebony
floundered
along
and
in
obedience
to
the
word
of
command
came
to
a
dead
stop
on
the
opposite
side
of
stubb’s
sideboard
when
with
both
hands
folded
before
him
and
resting
on
his
two-legged
cane
he
bowed
his
arched
back
still
further
over
at
the
same
time
sideways
inclining
his
head
so
as
to
bring
his
best
ear
into
play
“cook,”
said
stubb
rapidly
lifting
a
rather
reddish
morsel
to
his
mouth
“don’t
you
think
this
steak
is
rather
overdone
you’ve
been
beating
this
steak
too
much

it’s
too
tender

i
always
say
that
to
be
good
a
whale-steak
must
be
tough
there
are
those
sharks
now
over

they
prefer
it

rare
what

shindy

are
kicking
up

and
deliver
my
message

snatching
one
from
his
sideboard
“now
then
go
and
preach
to
’em!”
sullenly
taking
the
offered
lantern
old
fleece
limped
across
the
deck
to
the
bulwarks
and
then
with
one
hand
dropping
his
light
low
over
the
sea
so
as
to
get
a
good
view
of
his
congregation
with
the
other
hand
he
solemnly
flourished
his
tongs
and
leaning
far
over
the
side
in
a
mumbling
voice
began
addressing
the
sharks
while
stubb
softly
crawling
behind
overheard
all
that
was
said
“fellow-critters
i’se
ordered
here
to
say
dat
you
must
stop
dat

up
to

hatchings
but
by
gor
you
must
stop
dat
dam
racket!”
“cook,”
here
interposed
stubb
accompanying
the
word
with
a
sudden
slap
on
the
shoulder,—“cook
why
damn
your
eyes
you
mustn’t
swear
that
way
when
you’re
preaching
that’s
no
way
to
convert
sinners
cook!”
“who
dat
den
preach
to
him
yourself,”
sullenly
turning
to
go
“no
cook
go
on
go
on.”
“well
den
belubed
fellow-critters:”—
“right!”
exclaimed
stubb
approvingly
“coax
’em
to
it
try
that,”
and
fleece
continued
“do

“cook,”
cried
stubb
collaring
him
“i
won’t
have
that
swearing
talk
to
’em
gentlemanly.”
once
more
the
sermon
proceeded
“your

“well

cried
stubb
“that’s

“no

“upon
my
soul
i
am
about
of
the
same
opinion
so
give
the
benediction
fleece
and
i’ll
away
to
my
supper.”
upon
this
fleece
holding
both
hands
over
the
fishy
mob
raised
his
shrill
voice
and
cried—
“cussed
fellow-critters
kick
up
de
damndest
row
as
ever
you
can
fill
your
dam’
bellies
’till

bust—and

“now
cook,”
said
stubb
resuming
his
supper
at
the
capstan
“stand
just
where
you
stood
before
there
over
against
me
and
pay
particular
attention.”
“all
dention,”
said
fleece
again
stooping
over
upon
his
tongs
in
the
desired
position
“well,”
said
stubb
helping
himself
freely
meanwhile
“i
shall
now
go
back
to
the
subject
of
this
steak
in
the
first
place
how
old
are
you
cook?”
“what
dat
do
wid
de
’teak,”
said
the
old
black
testily
“silence
how
old
are
you
cook?”
“’bout
ninety
dey
say,”
he
gloomily
muttered
“and
you
have
lived
in
this
world
hard
upon
one
hundred
years
cook
and
don’t
know
yet
how
to
cook
a
whale-steak?”
rapidly
bolting
another
mouthful
at
the
last
word
so
that
morsel
seemed
a
continuation
of
the
question
“where
were
you
born
cook?”
“’hind
de
hatchway
in
ferry-boat
goin’
ober
de
roanoke.”
“born
in
a
ferry-boat
that’s
queer
too
but
i
want
to
know
what
country
you
were
born
in
cook!”
“didn’t
i
say
de
roanoke
country?”
he
cried
sharply
“no
you
didn’t
cook
but
i’ll
tell
you
what
i’m
coming
to
cook
you
must
go
home
and
be
born
over
again
you
don’t
know
how
to
cook
a
whale-steak
yet.”
“bress
my
soul
if
i
cook
noder
one,”
he
growled
angrily
turning
round
to
depart
“come
back
cook;—here
hand
me
those
tongs;—now
take
that
bit
of
steak
there
and
tell
me
if
you
think
that
steak
cooked
as
it
should
be
take
it
i
say”—holding
the
tongs
towards
him—“take
it
and
taste
it.”
faintly
smacking
his
withered
lips
over
it
for
a
moment
the
old
negro
muttered
“best
cooked
’teak
i
eber
taste
joosy
berry

himself
once
more

sullenly

you

changing
his

“he

holding

straight
over

keeping

there
very
solemnly
“so

again
in

“you

wriggling
his

him
by

as
you
may
say
this
seems
so
outlandish
a
thing
that
one
must
needs
go
a
little
into
the
history
and
philosophy
of
it
it
is
upon
record
that
three
centuries
ago
the
tongue
of
the
right
whale
was
esteemed
a
great
delicacy
in
france
and
commanded
large
prices
there
also
that
in
henry
viiith’s
time
a
certain
cook
of
the
court
obtained
a
handsome
reward
for
inventing
an
admirable
sauce
to
be
eaten
with
barbacued
porpoises
which
you
remember
are
a
species
of
whale
porpoises
indeed
are
to
this
day
considered
fine
eating
the
meat
is
made
into
balls
about
the
size
of
billiard
balls
and
being
well
seasoned
and
spiced
might
be
taken
for
turtle-balls
or
veal
balls
the
old
monks
of
dunfermline
were
very
fond
of
them
they
had
a
great
porpoise
grant
from
the
crown
the
fact
is
that
among
his
hunters
at
least
the
whale
would
by
all
hands
be
considered
a
noble
dish
were
there
not
so
much
of
him
but
when
you
come
to

it
takes

only
the
most

of

like

partake
of
cooked
whales
but
the
esquimaux
are
not
so
fastidious
we
all
know
how
they
live
upon
whales
and
have
rare
old
vintages
of

old
train
oil
zogranda
one
of
their
most
famous
doctors
recommends
strips
of
blubber
for
infants
as
being
exceedingly
juicy
and
nourishing
and
this
reminds
me
that
certain
englishmen
who
long
ago
were
accidentally
left
in
greenland
by
a
whaling
vessel—that
these
men
actually
lived
for
several
months
on
the
mouldy
scraps
of
whales
which
had
been
left
ashore
after
trying
out
the
blubber
among
the
dutch
whalemen
these
scraps
are
called
“fritters”
which
indeed
they
greatly
resemble
being
brown
and
crisp
and
smelling
something
like
old
amsterdam
housewives’
dough-nuts
or
oly-cooks
when
fresh
they
have
such
an
eatable
look
that
the
most
self-denying
stranger
can
hardly
keep
his
hands
off
but
what
further
depreciates
the
whale
as
a
civilized
dish
is
his
exceeding
richness
he
is
the
great
prize
ox
of
the
sea
too
fat
to
be
delicately
good
look
at
his
hump
which
would
be
as
fine
eating
as
the
buffalo’s
which
is
esteemed
a
rare
dish
were
it
not
such
a
solid
pyramid
of
fat
but
the
spermaceti
itself
how
bland
and
creamy
that
is
like
the
transparent
half-jellied
white
meat
of
a
cocoanut
in
the
third
month
of
its
growth
yet
far
too
rich
to
supply
a
substitute
for
butter
nevertheless
many
whalemen
have
a
method
of
absorbing
it
into
some
other
substance
and
then
partaking
of
it
in
the
long
try
watches
of
the
night
it
is
a
common
thing
for
the
seamen
to
dip
their
ship-biscuit
into
the
huge
oil-pots
and
let
them
fry
there
awhile

of
the

is
broken
into
with

axe
and
the
two
plump
whitish
lobes
being
withdrawn
precisely
resembling
two
large
puddings
they
are
then
mixed
with
flour
and
cooked
into
a
most
delectable
mess
in
flavor
somewhat
resembling
calves’
head
which
is
quite
a
dish
among
some
epicures
and
every
one
knows
that
some
young
bucks
among
the
epicures
by
continually
dining
upon
calves’
brains
by
and
by
get
to
have
a
little
brains
of

own
so
as
to
be
able
to
tell
a
calf’s
head
from
their
own
heads
which
indeed
requires
uncommon
discrimination
and
that
is
the
reason
why
a
young

with
an
intelligent
looking

head
before
him
is
somehow
one
of
the
saddest
sights

can
see

head
looks
a
sort
of
reproachfully
at
him
with
an
“et
tu
brute!”
expression
it
is
not
perhaps
entirely
because
the
whale
is
so
excessively
unctuous
that
landsmen
seem
to
regard
the
eating
of
him
with
abhorrence
that
appears
to
result
in
some
way
from
the
consideration
before
mentioned
_i.e._
that
a
man
should
eat
a
newly
murdered
thing
of
the
sea
and
eat
it
too
by
its
own
light
but
no
doubt
the
first
man
that

murdered
an
ox
was
regarded
as
a
murderer
perhaps
he
was
hung
and
if
he
had
been
put
on
his
trial
by
oxen
he
certainly
would
have
been
and
he
certainly
deserved
it

their

voracity

tickle

lowering
three

so
that
they
cast
long
gleams
of

over

these

mariners
darting
their

kept
up
an
incessant
murdering
of

by
striking
the
keen
steel
deep
into

part

in
the
foamy
confusion
of
their

and

the
marksmen
could
not

hit

this
brought
about

by

the

sways

as
if
let
down
from

and
every
one

take
good
heed
to
dodge

one
of
the

advances
with
a
long
keen
weapon
called
a

he
dexterously
slices
out
a
considerable
hole
in
the
lower
part
of
the
swaying
mass
into
this
hole
the
end
of
the
second
alternating
great
tackle
is
then
hooked
so
as
to
retain
a
hold
upon
the
blubber
in
order
to
prepare
for
what
follows
whereupon
this
accomplished
swordsman
warning
all
hands
to
stand
off
once
more
makes
a
scientific
dash
at
the
mass
and
with
a
few
sidelong
desperate
lunging
slicings
severs
it
completely
in

so
that
while
the
short

part
is
still
fast
the
long
upper
strip
called
a
blanket-piece
swings
clear
and
is
all
ready
for
lowering
the
heavers
forward
now
resume
their
song
and
while
the
one
tackle
is
peeling
and
hoisting
a

the

is
slowly
slackened
away
and
down
goes
the

through
the

an
unfurnished

called
the

into
this
twilight

sundry
nimble
hands
keep
coiling
away
the
long
blanket-piece
as
if
it

thus
the

68
the
blanket
i
have
given
no
small
attention
to
that
not
unvexed
subject
the
skin
of
the
whale
i
have
had
controversies
about
it
with
experienced
whalemen
afloat
and
learned
naturalists
ashore
my
original
opinion
remains
unchanged
but
it
is
only
an
opinion
the
question
is
what
and
where
is
the
skin
of
the
whale
already
you
know
what
his
blubber
is
that
blubber
is
something
of
the
consistence
of
firm
close-grained
beef
but
tougher
more
elastic
and
compact
and
ranges
from
eight
or
ten
to
twelve
and
fifteen
inches
in
thickness
now
however
preposterous
it
may
at
first
seem
to
talk
of
any
creature’s
skin
as
being
of
that
sort
of
consistence
and
thickness
yet
in
point
of
fact
these
are
no
arguments
against
such
a
presumption
because
you
cannot
raise
any
other
dense
enveloping
layer
from
the
whale’s
body
but
that
same
blubber
and
the
outermost
enveloping
layer
of
any
animal
if
reasonably
dense
what
can
that
be
but
the
skin
true
from
the
unmarred
dead
body
of
the
whale
you
may
scrape
off
with
your
hand
an
infinitely
thin
transparent
substance
somewhat
resembling
the
thinnest
shreds
of
isinglass
only
it
is
almost
as
flexible
and
soft
as
satin
that
is
previous
to
being
dried
when
it
not
only
contracts
and
thickens
but
becomes
rather
hard
and
brittle
i
have
several
such
dried
bits
which
i
use
for
marks
in
my
whale-books
it
is
transparent
as
i
said
before
and
being
laid
upon
the
printed
page
i
have
sometimes
pleased
myself
with
fancying
it
exerted
a
magnifying
influence
at
any
rate
it
is
pleasant
to
read
about
whales
through
their
own
spectacles
as
you
may
say
but
what
i
am
driving
at
here
is
this
that
same
infinitely
thin
isinglass
substance
which
i
admit
invests
the
entire
body
of
the
whale
is
not
so
much
to
be
regarded
as
the
skin
of
the
creature
as
the
skin
of
the
skin
so
to
speak
for
it
were
simply
ridiculous
to
say
that
the
proper
skin
of
the
tremendous
whale
is
thinner
and
more
tender
than
the
skin
of
a
new-born
child
but
no
more
of
this
assuming
the
blubber
to
be
the
skin
of
the
whale
then
when
this
skin
as
in
the
case
of
a
very
large
sperm
whale
will
yield
the
bulk
of
one
hundred
barrels
of
oil
and
when
it
is
considered
that
in
quantity
or
rather
weight
that
oil
in
its
expressed
state
is
only
three
fourths
and
not
the
entire
substance
of
the
coat
some
idea
may
hence
be
had
of
the
enormousness
of
that
animated
mass
a
mere
part
of
whose
mere
integument
yields
such
a
lake
of
liquid
as
that
reckoning
ten
barrels
to
the
ton
you
have
ten
tons
for
the
net
weight
of
only
three
quarters
of
the
stuff
of
the
whale’s
skin
in
life
the
visible
surface
of
the
sperm
whale
is
not
the
least
among
the
many
marvels
he
presents
almost
invariably
it
is
all
over
obliquely
crossed
and
re-crossed
with
numberless
straight
marks
in
thick
array
something
like
those
in
the
finest
italian
line
engravings
but
these
marks
do
not
seem
to
be
impressed
upon
the
isinglass
substance
above
mentioned
but
seem
to
be
seen
through
it
as
if
they
were
engraved
upon
the
body
itself
nor
is
this
all
in
some
instances
to
the
quick
observant
eye
those
linear
marks
as
in
a
veritable
engraving
but
afford
the
ground
for
far
other
delineations
these
are
hieroglyphical
that
is
if
you
call
those
mysterious
cyphers
on
the
walls
of
pyramids
hieroglyphics
then
that
is
the
proper
word
to
use
in
the
present
connexion
by
my
retentive
memory
of
the
hieroglyphics
upon
one
sperm
whale
in
particular
i
was
much
struck
with
a
plate
representing
the
old
indian
characters
chiselled
on
the
famous
hieroglyphic
palisades
on
the
banks
of
the
upper
mississippi
like
those
mystic
rocks
too
the
mystic-marked
whale
remains
undecipherable
this
allusion
to
the
indian
rocks
reminds
me
of
another
thing
besides
all
the
other
phenomena
which
the
exterior
of
the
sperm
whale
presents
he
not
seldom
displays
the
back
and
more
especially
his
flanks
effaced
in
great
part
of
the
regular
linear
appearance
by
reason
of
numerous
rude
scratches
altogether
of
an
irregular
random
aspect
i
should
say
that
those
new
england
rocks
on
the
sea-coast
which
agassiz
imagines
to
bear
the
marks
of
violent
scraping
contact
with
vast
floating
icebergs—i
should
say
that
those
rocks
must
not
a
little
resemble
the
sperm
whale
in
this
particular
it
also
seems
to
me
that
such
scratches
in
the
whale
are
probably
made
by
hostile
contact
with
other
whales
for
i
have
most
remarked
them
in
the
large
full-grown
bulls
of
the
species
a
word
or
two
more
concerning
this
matter
of
the
skin
or
blubber
of
the
whale
it
has
already
been
said
that
it
is
stript
from
him
in
long
pieces
called
blanket-pieces
like
most
sea-terms
this
one
is
very
happy
and
significant
for
the
whale
is
indeed
wrapt
up
in
his
blubber
as
in
a
real
blanket
or
counterpane
or
still
better
an
indian
poncho
slipt
over
his
head
and
skirting
his
extremity
it
is
by
reason
of
this
cosy
blanketing
of
his
body
that
the
whale
is
enabled
to
keep
himself
comfortable
in
all
weathers
in
all
seas
times
and
tides
what
would
become
of
a
greenland
whale
say
in
those
shuddering
icy
seas
of
the
north
if
unsupplied
with
his
cosy
surtout
true
other
fish
are
found
exceedingly
brisk
in
those
hyperborean
waters
but
these
be
it
observed
are
your
cold-blooded
lungless
fish
whose
very
bellies
are
refrigerators
creatures
that
warm
themselves
under
the
lee
of
an
iceberg
as
a
traveller
in
winter
would
bask
before
an
inn
fire
whereas
like
man
the
whale
has
lungs
and
warm
blood
freeze
his
blood
and
he
dies
how
wonderful
is
it
then—except
after
explanation—that
this
great
monster
to
whom
corporeal
warmth
is
as
indispensable
as
it
is
to
man
how
wonderful
that
he
should
be
found
at
home
immersed
to
his
lips
for
life
in
those
arctic
waters
where
when
seamen
fall
overboard
they
are
sometimes
found
months
afterwards
perpendicularly
frozen
into
the
hearts
of
fields
of
ice
as
a
fly
is
found
glued
in
amber
but
more
surprising
is
it
to
know
as
has
been
proved
by
experiment
that
the
blood
of
a
polar
whale
is
warmer
than
that
of
a
borneo
negro
in
summer
it
does
seem
to
me
that
herein
we
see
the
rare
virtue
of
a
strong
individual
vitality
and
the
rare
virtue
of
thick
walls
and
the
rare
virtue
of
interior
spaciousness
oh
man
admire
and
model
thyself
after
the
whale
do
thou
too
remain
warm
among
ice
do
thou
too
live
in
this
world
without
being
of
it
be
cool
at
the
equator
keep
thy
blood
fluid
at
the
pole
like
the
great
dome
of
st
peter’s
and
like
the
great
whale
retain
o
man
in
all
seasons
a
temperature
of
thine
own
but
how
easy
and
how
hopeless
to
teach
these
fine
things
of
erections
how
few
are
domed
like
st
peter’s
of
creatures
how
few

there’s
a
most
doleful
and

mocking
funeral
the
sea-vultures
all
in
pious
mourning
the
air-sharks
all
punctiliously

horrible
vultureism

from
which
not
the

is
free
nor
is
this
the
end
desecrated
as
the

is
a
vengeful
ghost
survives

hovers
over
it
to
scare
espied
by
some
timid
man-of-war
or

discovery-vessel
from
afar
when
the
distance
obscuring

still
shows
the

the

with
trembling

down

and
for

afterwards
perhaps

shun
the

leaping
over

as
silly

leap
over

of

he

the
beheading
of
the
sperm
whale
is
a
scientific
anatomical
feat
upon
which
experienced
whale
surgeons
very
much
pride
themselves
and
not
without
reason
consider
that
the
whale
has
nothing
that
can
properly
be
called
a
neck
on
the
contrary
where
his
head
and
body
seem
to
join
there
in
that
very
place
is
the
thickest
part
of
him
remember
also
that
the
surgeon
must
operate
from
above
some
eight
or
ten
feet
intervening
between
him
and
his
subject

subject
almost
hidden
in
a
discoloured
rolling
and
oftentimes
tumultuous
and
bursting
sea
bear
in
mind
too
that
under
these
untoward
circumstances
he
has
to
cut
many
feet
deep
in
the
flesh
and
in
that
subterraneous
manner
without
so
much
as
getting
one
single
peep
into
the
ever-contracting
gash
thus
made
he
must
skilfully
steer
clear
of
all
adjacent
interdicted
parts
and
exactly
divide
the
spine
at
a
critical
point
hard
by
its
insertion
into
the
skull
do
you
not
marvel
then
at
stubb’s
boast
that
he
demanded
but
ten
minutes
to
behead
a
sperm
whale
when
first
severed
the
head
is
dropped
astern
and
held
there
by
a
cable
till
the
body
is
stripped
that
done
if
it
belong
to
a
small
whale
it
is
hoisted
on
deck
to
be
deliberately
disposed
of
but
with
a
full
grown
leviathan
this
is
impossible
for
the
sperm
whale’s
head
embraces
nearly
one
third
of
his
entire
bulk
and
completely
to
suspend
such
a
burden
as
that
even
by
the
immense
tackles
of
a
whaler
this
were
as
vain
a
thing
as
to
attempt
weighing
a
dutch
barn
in
jewellers’
scales
the
pequod’s
whale
being
decapitated
and
the
body
stripped
the
head
was
hoisted
against
the
ship’s
side—about
half
way
out
of
the
sea
so
that
it
might
yet
in
great
part
be
buoyed
up
by
its
native
element
and
there
with
the
strained
craft
steeply
leaning
over
to
it
by
reason
of
the
enormous
downward
drag
from
the
lower
mast-head
and
every
yard-arm
on
that
side
projecting
like
a
crane
over
the
waves
there
that
blood-dripping
head
hung
to
the
pequod’s
waist
like
the
giant
holofernes’s
from
the
girdle
of
judith
when
this
last
task
was
accomplished
it
was
noon
and
the
seamen
went
below
to
their
dinner
silence
reigned
over
the
before
tumultuous
but
now
deserted
deck
an
intense
copper
calm
like
a
universal
yellow
lotus
was
more
and
more
unfolding
its
noiseless
measureless
leaves
upon
the
sea
a
short
space
elapsed
and
up
into
this
noiselessness
came
ahab
alone
from
his
cabin
taking
a
few
turns
on
the
quarter-deck
he
paused
to
gaze
over
the
side
then
slowly
getting
into
the
main-chains
he
took
stubb’s
long
spade—still
remaining
there
after
the
whale’s
decapitation—and
striking
it
into
the
lower
part
of
the
half-suspended
mass
placed
its
other
end
crutch-wise
under
one
arm
and
so
stood
leaning
over
with
eyes
attentively
fixed
on
this
head
it
was
a
black
and
hooded
head
and
hanging
there
in
the
midst
of
so
intense
a
calm
it
seemed
the
sphynx’s
in
the
desert
“speak
thou
vast
and
venerable
head,”
muttered
ahab
“which

ungarnished
with

the

came

by

making

to
some

the

not

to

the

was
set
to
see
what
response
would
be
made

be
it
said
that
like
the
vessels
of
military
marines
the
ships
of
the
american
whale
fleet
have
each
a
private
signal
all
which
signals
being
collected
in
a
book
with
the
names
of
the

vessels
attached
every

is
provided
with
it

the

are
enabled
to
recognise

the

at
considerable
distances
and
with
no
small
facility
the
pequod’s
signal
was
at
last
responded
to
by
the
stranger’s
setting
her
own
which
proved
the
ship
to
be
the
jeroboam
of
nantucket
squaring
her
yards
she
bore
down
ranged
abeam
under
the
pequod’s
lee
and
lowered
a
boat
it
soon
drew
nigh
but
as
the
side-ladder
was
being
rigged
by
starbuck’s
order
to
accommodate
the
visiting
captain
the
stranger
in
question
waved
his
hand
from
his
boat’s
stern
in
token
of
that
proceeding
being
entirely
unnecessary
it
turned
out
that
the
jeroboam
had
a
malignant
epidemic
on
board
and
that
mayhew
her
captain
was
fearful
of
infecting
the
pequod’s
company
for
though
himself
and
boat’s
crew
remained
untainted
and
though
his
ship
was
half
a
rifle-shot
off
and
an
incorruptible
sea
and
air
rolling
and
flowing
between
yet
conscientiously
adhering
to
the
timid
quarantine
of
the
land
he
peremptorily
refused
to
come
into
direct
contact
with
the
pequod
but
this
did
by
no
means
prevent
all
communications
preserving
an
interval
of
some
few
yards
between
itself
and
the
ship
the
jeroboam’s
boat
by
the
occasional
use
of
its
oars
contrived
to
keep
parallel
to
the
pequod
as
she
heavily
forged
through
the
sea
for
by
this
time
it
blew
very
fresh
with
her
main-topsail
aback
though
indeed
at
times
by
the
sudden
onset
of
a
large
rolling
wave
the
boat
would
be
pushed
some
way
ahead
but
would
be
soon
skilfully
brought
to
her
proper
bearings
again
subject
to
this
and
other
the
like
interruptions
now
and
then
a
conversation
was
sustained
between
the
two
parties
but
at
intervals
not
without
still
another
interruption
of
a
very
different
sort
pulling
an
oar
in
the
jeroboam’s
boat
was
a
man
of
a
singular
appearance
even
in
that
wild
whaling
life
where
individual
notabilities
make
up
all
totalities
he
was
a
small
short
youngish
man
sprinkled
all
over
his
face
with
freckles
and
wearing
redundant
yellow
hair
a
long-skirted
cabalistically-cut
coat
of
a
faded
walnut
tinge
enveloped
him
the
overlapping
sleeves
of
which
were
rolled
up
on
his
wrists
a
deep
settled
fanatic
delirium
was
in
his
eyes
so
soon
as
this
figure
had
been
first
descried
stubb
had
exclaimed—“that’s
he
that’s
he!—the
long-togged
scaramouch
the
town-ho’s
company
told
us
of!”
stubb
here
alluded
to
a
strange
story
told
of
the
jeroboam
and
a
certain
man
among
her
crew
some
time
previous
when
the
pequod
spoke
the
town-ho
according
to
this
account
and
what
was
subsequently
learned
it
seemed
that
the
scaramouch
in
question
had
gained
a
wonderful
ascendency
over
almost
everybody
in
the
jeroboam
his
story
was
this
he
had
been
originally
nurtured
among
the
crazy
society
of
neskyeuna
shakers
where
he
had
been
a
great
prophet
in
their
cracked
secret
meetings
having
several
times
descended
from
heaven
by
the
way
of
a
trap-door
announcing
the
speedy
opening
of
the
seventh
vial
which
he
carried
in
his
vest-pocket
but
which
instead
of
containing
gunpowder
was
supposed
to
be
charged
with
laudanum
a
strange
apostolic
whim
having
seized
him
he
had
left
neskyeuna
for
nantucket
where
with
that
cunning
peculiar
to
craziness
he
assumed
a
steady
common-sense
exterior
and
offered
himself
as
a
green-hand
candidate
for
the
jeroboam’s
whaling
voyage
they
engaged
him
but
straightway
upon
the
ship’s
getting
out
of
sight
of
land
his
insanity
broke
out
in
a
freshet
he
announced
himself
as
the
archangel
gabriel
and
commanded
the
captain
to
jump
overboard
he
published
his
manifesto
whereby
he
set
himself
forth
as
the
deliverer
of
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
vicar-general
of
all
oceanica
the
unflinching
earnestness
with
which
he
declared
these
things;—the
dark
daring
play
of
his
sleepless
excited
imagination
and
all
the
preternatural
terrors
of
real
delirium
united
to
invest
this
gabriel
in
the
minds
of
the
majority
of
the
ignorant
crew
with
an
atmosphere
of
sacredness
moreover
they
were
afraid
of
him
as
such
a
man
however
was
not
of
much
practical
use
in
the
ship
especially
as
he
refused
to
work
except
when
he
pleased
the
incredulous
captain
would
fain
have
been
rid
of
him
but
apprised
that
that
individual’s
intention
was
to
land
him
in
the
first
convenient
port
the
archangel
forthwith
opened
all
his
seals
and
vials—devoting
the
ship
and
all
hands
to
unconditional
perdition
in
case
this
intention
was
carried
out
so
strongly
did
he
work
upon
his
disciples
among
the
crew
that
at
last
in
a
body
they
went
to
the
captain
and
told
him
if
gabriel
was
sent
from
the
ship
not
a
man
of
them
would
remain
he
was
therefore
forced
to
relinquish
his
plan
nor
would
they
permit
gabriel
to
be
any
way
maltreated
say
or
do
what
he
would
so
that
it
came
to
pass
that
gabriel
had
the
complete
freedom
of
the
ship
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
that
the
archangel
cared
little
or
nothing
for
the
captain
and
mates
and
since
the
epidemic
had
broken
out
he
carried
a
higher
hand
than
ever
declaring
that
the
plague
as
he
called
it
was
at
his
sole
command
nor
should
it
be
stayed
but
according
to
his
good
pleasure
the
sailors
mostly
poor
devils
cringed
and
some
of
them
fawned
before
him
in
obedience
to
his
instructions
sometimes
rendering
him
personal
homage
as
to
a
god
such
things
may
seem
incredible
but
however
wondrous
they
are
true
nor
is
the
history
of
fanatics
half
so
striking
in
respect
to
the
measureless
self-deception
of
the
fanatic
himself
as
his
measureless
power
of
deceiving
and
bedevilling
so
many
others
but
it
is
time
to
return
to
the
pequod
“i
fear
not
thy
epidemic
man,”
said
ahab
from
the
bulwarks
to
captain
mayhew
who
stood
in
the
boat’s
stern
“come
on
board.”
but
now
gabriel
started
to
his
feet
“think
think
of
the
fevers
yellow
and
bilious
beware
of
the
horrible
plague!”
“gabriel
gabriel!”
cried
captain
mayhew
“thou
must
either—”
but
that
instant
a
headlong
wave
shot
the
boat
far
ahead
and
its
seethings
drowned
all
speech
“hast
thou
seen
the
white
whale?”
demanded
ahab
when
the
boat
drifted
back
“think
think
of
thy
whale-boat
stoven
and
sunk
beware
of
the
horrible
tail!”
“i
tell
thee
again
gabriel
that—”
but
again
the
boat
tore
ahead
as
if
dragged
by
fiends
nothing
was
said
for
some
moments
while
a
succession
of
riotous
waves
rolled
by
which
by
one
of
those
occasional
caprices
of
the
seas
were
tumbling
not
heaving
it
meantime
the
hoisted
sperm
whale’s
head
jogged
about
very
violently
and
gabriel
was
seen
eyeing
it
with
rather
more
apprehensiveness
than
his
archangel
nature
seemed
to
warrant
when
this
interlude
was
over
captain
mayhew
began
a
dark
story
concerning
moby
dick
not
however
without
frequent
interruptions
from
gabriel
whenever
his
name
was
mentioned
and
the
crazy
sea
that
seemed
leagued
with
him
it
seemed
that
the
jeroboam
had
not
long
left
home
when
upon
speaking
a
whale-ship
her
people
were
reliably
apprised
of
the
existence
of
moby
dick
and
the
havoc
he
had
made
greedily
sucking
in
this
intelligence
gabriel
solemnly
warned
the
captain
against
attacking
the
white
whale
in
case
the
monster
should
be
seen
in
his
gibbering
insanity
pronouncing
the
white
whale
to
be
no
less
a
being
than
the
shaker
god
incarnated
the
shakers
receiving
the
bible
but
when
some
year
or
two
afterwards
moby
dick
was
fairly
sighted
from
the
mast-heads
macey
the
chief
mate
burned
with
ardour
to
encounter
him
and
the
captain
himself
being
not
unwilling
to
let
him
have
the
opportunity
despite
all
the
archangel’s
denunciations
and
forewarnings
macey
succeeded
in
persuading
five
men
to
man
his
boat
with
them
he
pushed
off
and
after
much
weary
pulling
and
many
perilous
unsuccessful
onsets
he
at
last
succeeded
in
getting
one
iron
fast
meantime
gabriel
ascending
to
the
main-royal
mast-head
was
tossing
one
arm
in
frantic
gestures
and
hurling
forth
prophecies
of
speedy
doom
to
the
sacrilegious
assailants
of
his
divinity
now
while
macey
the
mate
was
standing
up
in
his
boat’s
bow
and
with
all
the
reckless
energy
of
his
tribe
was
venting
his
wild
exclamations
upon
the
whale
and
essaying
to
get
a
fair
chance
for
his
poised
lance
lo
a
broad
white
shadow
rose
from
the
sea
by
its
quick
fanning
motion
temporarily
taking
the
breath
out
of
the
bodies
of
the
oarsmen
next
instant
the
luckless
mate
so
full
of
furious
life
was
smitten
bodily
into
the
air
and
making
a
long
arc
in
his
descent
fell
into
the
sea
at
the
distance
of
about
fifty
yards
not
a
chip
of
the
boat
was
harmed
nor
a
hair
of
any
oarsman’s
head
but
the
mate
for
ever
sank
it
is
well
to
parenthesize
here
that
of
the
fatal
accidents
in
the
sperm-whale
fishery
this
kind
is
perhaps
almost
as
frequent
as
any
sometimes
nothing
is
injured
but
the
man
who
is
thus
annihilated
oftener
the
boat’s
bow
is
knocked
off
or
the
thigh-board
in
which
the
headsman
stands
is
torn
from
its
place
and
accompanies
the
body
but
strangest
of
all
is
the
circumstance
that
in
more
instances
than
one
when
the
body
has
been
recovered
not
a
single
mark
of
violence
is
discernible
the
man
being
stark
dead
the
whole
calamity
with
the
falling
form
of
macey
was
plainly
descried
from
the
ship
raising
a
piercing
shriek—“the
vial
the
vial!”
gabriel
called
off
the
terror-stricken
crew
from
the
further
hunting
of
the
whale
this
terrible
event
clothed
the
archangel
with
added
influence
because
his
credulous
disciples
believed
that
he
had
specifically
fore-announced
it
instead
of
only
making
a
general
prophecy
which
any
one
might
have
done
and
so
have
chanced
to
hit
one
of
many
marks
in
the
wide
margin
allowed
he
became
a
nameless
terror
to
the
ship
mayhew
having
concluded
his
narration
ahab
put
such
questions
to
him
that
the
stranger
captain
could
not
forbear
inquiring
whether
he
intended
to
hunt
the
white
whale
if
opportunity
should
offer
to
which
ahab
answered—“aye.”
straightway
then
gabriel
once
more
started
to
his
feet
glaring
upon
the
old
man
and
vehemently
exclaimed
with
downward
pointed
finger—“think
think
of
the
blasphemer—dead
and
down
there!—beware
of
the
blasphemer’s
end!”
ahab
stolidly
turned
aside
then
said
to
mayhew
“captain
i
have
just
bethought
me
of
my
letter-bag
there
is
a
letter
for
one
of
thy
officers
if
i
mistake
not
starbuck
look
over
the
bag.”
every
whale-ship
takes
out
a
goodly
number
of
letters
for
various
ships
whose
delivery
to
the
persons
to
whom
they
may
be
addressed
depends
upon
the
mere
chance
of
encountering
them
in
the
four
oceans
thus
most
letters
never
reach
their
mark
and
many
are
only
received
after
attaining
an
age
of
two
or
three
years
or
more
soon
starbuck
returned
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
it
was
sorely
tumbled
damp
and
covered
with
a
dull
spotted
green
mould
in
consequence
of
being
kept
in
a
dark
locker
of
the
cabin
of
such
a
letter
death
himself
might
well
have
been
the
post-boy
“can’st
not
read
it?”
cried
ahab
“give
it
me
man
aye
aye
it’s
but
a
dim
scrawl;—what’s
this?”
as
he
was
studying
it
out
starbuck
took
a
long
cutting-spade
pole
and
with
his
knife
slightly
split
the
end
to
insert
the
letter
there
and
in
that
way
hand
it
to
the
boat
without
its
coming
any
closer
to
the
ship
meantime
ahab
holding
the
letter
muttered
“mr
har—yes
mr
harry—(a
woman’s
pinny
hand,—the
man’s
wife
i’ll
wager)—aye—mr
harry
macey
ship
jeroboam;—why
it’s
macey
and
he’s
dead!”
“poor
fellow
poor
fellow
and
from
his
wife,”
sighed
mayhew
“but
let
me
have
it.”
“nay
keep
it
thyself,”
cried
gabriel
to
ahab
“thou
art
soon
going
that
way.”
“curses
throttle
thee!”
yelled
ahab
“captain
mayhew
stand
by
now
to
receive
it”
and
taking
the
fatal
missive
from
starbuck’s
hands
he
caught
it
in
the
slit
of
the
pole
and
reached
it
over
towards
the
boat
but
as
he
did
so
the
oarsmen
expectantly
desisted
from
rowing
the
boat
drifted
a
little
towards
the
ship’s
stern
so
that
as
if
by
magic
the
letter
suddenly
ranged
along
with
gabriel’s
eager
hand
he
clutched
it
in
an
instant
seized
the
boat-knife
and
impaling
the
letter
on
it
sent
it
thus
loaded
back
into
the
ship
it
fell
at
ahab’s
feet
then
gabriel
shrieked
out
to
his
comrades
to
give
way
with
their
oars
and
in
that
manner
the
mutinous
boat
rapidly
shot
away
from
the
pequod
as
after
this
interlude
the
seamen
resumed
their
work
upon
the
jacket
of
the
whale
many
strange
things
were
hinted
in
reference
to
this
wild
affair
chapter

the

in
the
tumultuous
business
of
cutting-in
and

is
much
running
backwards
and

among
the

there

to
be

everywhere
it
is
much
the
same
with
him
who
endeavors
the
description
of
the
scene
we
must
now
retrace
our
way
a
little
it
was
mentioned
that
upon
first
breaking
ground
in
the
whale’s
back
the
blubber-hook
was
inserted
into
the
original
hole
there
cut
by
the
spades
of
the
mates

how
did
so
clumsy
and
weighty
a
mass
as
that

hook
get
fixed

it

there
by

monster’s
back
for
the
special
purpose
referred
to
but
in
very
many
cases
circumstances
require
that
the
harpooneer
shall
remain
on
the
whale
till
the
whole
flensing
or
stripping
operation
is
concluded
the
whale
be
it
observed
lies
almost
entirely
submerged
excepting
the
immediate
parts
operated
upon
so
down
there
some
ten
feet
below
the
level
of
the
deck
the
poor
harpooneer
flounders
about
half
on
the
whale
and
half
in
the
water
as
the
vast
mass
revolves
like
a
tread-mill
beneath
him
on
the
occasion
in
question
queequeg
figured
in
the
highland
costume—a
shirt
and
socks—in
which
to
my
eyes
at
least
he
appeared
to
uncommon
advantage
and
no
one
had
a
better
chance
to
observe
him
as
will
presently
be
seen
being
the
savage’s
bowsman
that
is
the
person
who
pulled
the
bow-oar
in
his
boat
the
second
one
from
forward
it
was
my
cheerful
duty
to
attend
upon
him
while
taking
that
hard-scrabble
scramble
upon
the
dead
whale’s
back
you
have
seen
italian
organ-boys
holding
a
dancing-ape
by
a
long
cord
just
so
from
the
ship’s
steep
side
did
i
hold
queequeg
down
there
in
the
sea
by
what
is
technically
called
in
the
fishery
a
monkey-rope
attached
to
a
strong
strip
of
canvas
belted
round
his
waist
it
was
a
humorously
perilous
business
for
both
of
us
for
before
we
proceed
further
it
must
be
said
that
the
monkey-rope
was
fast
at
both
ends
fast
to
queequeg’s
broad
canvas
belt
and
fast
to
my
narrow
leather
one
so
that
for
better
or
for
worse
we
two
for
the
time
were
wedded
and
should
poor
queequeg
sink
to
rise
no
more
then
both
usage
and
honor
demanded
that
instead
of
cutting
the
cord
it
should
drag
me
down
in
his
wake
so
then
an
elongated
siamese
ligature
united
us
queequeg
was
my
own
inseparable
twin
brother
nor
could
i
any
way
get
rid
of
the
dangerous
liabilities
which
the
hempen
bond
entailed
so
strongly
and
metaphysically
did
i
conceive
of
my
situation
then
that
while
earnestly
watching
his
motions
i
seemed
distinctly
to
perceive
that
my
own
individuality
was
now
merged
in
a
joint
stock
company
of
two
that
my
free
will
had
received
a
mortal
wound
and
that
another’s
mistake
or
misfortune
might
plunge
innocent
me
into
unmerited
disaster
and
death
therefore
i
saw
that
here
was
a
sort
of
interregnum
in
providence
for
its
even-handed
equity
never
could
have
so
gross
an
injustice
and
yet
still
further
pondering—while
i
jerked
him
now
and
then
from
between
the
whale
and
ship
which
would
threaten
to
jam
him—still
further
pondering
i
say
i
saw
that
this
situation
of
mine
was
the
precise
situation
of
every
mortal
that
breathes
only
in
most
cases
he
one
way
or
other
has
this
siamese
connexion
with
a
plurality
of
other
mortals
if
your
banker
breaks
you
snap
if
your
apothecary
by
mistake
sends
you
poison
in
your
pills
you
die
true
you
may
say
that
by
exceeding
caution
you
may
possibly
escape
these
and
the
multitudinous
other
evil
chances
of
life
but
handle
queequeg’s
monkey-rope
heedfully
as
i
would
sometimes
he
jerked
it
so
that
i
came
very
near
sliding
overboard
nor
could
i
possibly
forget
that
do
what
i
would
i
only
had
the
management
of
one
end
of
it.*
*the
monkey-rope
is
found
in
all
whalers
but
it
was
only
in
the
pequod
that
the
monkey
and
his
holder
were
ever
tied
together
this
improvement
upon
the
original
usage
was
introduced
by
no
less
a
man
than
stubb
in
order
to
afford
the
imperilled
harpooneer
the
strongest
possible
guarantee
for
the
faithfulness
and
vigilance
of
his
monkey-rope
holder
i
have
hinted
that
i
would
often
jerk
poor
queequeg
from
between
the
whale
and
the
ship—where
he
would
occasionally
fall
from
the
incessant
rolling
and
swaying
of
both
but
this
was
not
the
only
jamming
jeopardy
he
was
exposed
to
unappalled
by
the
massacre
made
upon
them
during
the
night
the
sharks
now
freshly
and
more
keenly
allured
by
the
before
pent
blood
which
began
to
flow
from
the
carcass—the
rabid
creatures
swarmed
round
it
like
bees
in
a
beehive
and
right
in
among
those
sharks
was
queequeg
who
often
pushed
them
aside
with
his
floundering
feet
a
thing
altogether
incredible
were
it
not
that
attracted
by
such
prey
as
a
dead
whale
the
otherwise
miscellaneously
carnivorous
shark
will
seldom
touch
a
man
nevertheless
it
may
well
be
believed
that
since
they
have
such
a
ravenous
finger
in
the
pie
it
is
deemed
but
wise
to
look
sharp
to
them
accordingly
besides
the
monkey-rope
with
which
i
now
and
then
jerked
the
poor
fellow
from
too
close
a
vicinity
to
the
maw
of
what
seemed
a
peculiarly
ferocious
shark—he
was
provided
with
still
another
protection
suspended
over
the
side
in
one
of
the
stages
tashtego
and
daggoo
continually
flourished
over
his
head
a
couple
of
keen
whale-spades
wherewith
they
slaughtered
as
many
sharks
as
they
could
reach
this
procedure
of
theirs
to
be
sure
was
very
disinterested
and
benevolent
of
them
they
meant
queequeg’s
best
happiness
i
admit
but
in
their
hasty
zeal
to
befriend
him
and
from
the
circumstance
that
both
he
and
the
sharks
were
at
times
half
hidden
by
the
blood-muddled
water
those
indiscreet
spades
of
theirs
would
come
nearer
amputating
a
leg
than
a
tail
but
poor
queequeg
i
suppose
straining
and
gasping
there
with
that
great
iron
hook—poor
queequeg
i
suppose
only
prayed
to
his
yojo
and
gave
up
his
life
into
the
hands
of
his
gods
well
well
my
dear
comrade
and
twin-brother
thought
i
as
i
drew
in
and
then
slacked
off
the
rope
to
every
swell
of
the
sea—what
matters
it
after
all
are
you
not
the
precious
image
of
each
and
all
of
us
men
in
this
whaling
world
that
unsounded
ocean
you
gasp
in

foes

and
what
between

you
are
in
a
sad
pickle
and
peril

but
courage
there
is
good
cheer
in

for
you
queequeg
for
now
as
with
blue
lips
and
blood-shot
eyes
the
exhausted
savage
at
last
climbs
up
the
chains
and
stands
all
dripping
and
involuntarily
trembling
over
the
side
the
steward
advances
and
with
a
benevolent
consolatory
glance
hands
him—what
some
hot
cognac
no
hands
him
ye
gods
hands
him
a
cup
of
tepid
ginger
and
water
“ginger
do
i
smell
ginger?”
suspiciously
asked
stubb
coming
near
“yes
this
must
be
ginger,”
peering
into
the
as
yet
untasted
cup
then
standing
as
if
incredulous
for
a
while
he
calmly
walked
towards
the
astonished
steward
slowly
saying
“ginger
ginger
and
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
mr
dough-boy
where
lies
the
virtue
of
ginger
ginger
is
ginger
the
sort
of
fuel
you
use
dough-boy
to
kindle
a
fire
in
this
shivering
cannibal
ginger!—what
the
devil
is
ginger
sea-coal
firewood?—lucifer
matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what
the
devil
is
ginger
i
say
that
you
offer
this
cup
to
our
poor
queequeg
here.”
“there
is
some
sneaking
temperance
society
movement
about
this
business,”
he
suddenly
added
now
approaching
starbuck
who
had
just
come
from
forward
“will
you
look
at
that
kannakin
sir
smell
of
it
if
you
please.”
then
watching
the
mate’s
countenance
he
added
“the
steward
mr
starbuck
had
the
face
to
offer
that
calomel
and
jalap
to
queequeg
there
this
instant
off
the
whale
is
the
steward
an
apothecary
sir
and
may
i
ask
whether
this
is
the
sort
of
bitters
by
which
he
blows
back
the
life
into
a
half-drowned
man?”
“i
trust
not,”
said
starbuck
“it
is
poor
stuff
enough.”
“aye
aye
steward,”
cried
stubb
“we’ll
teach
you
to
drug
a
harpooneer
none
of
your
apothecary’s
medicine
here
you
want
to
poison
us
do
ye
you
have
got
out
insurances
on
our
lives
and
want
to
murder
us
all
and
pocket
the
proceeds
do
ye?”
“it
was
not
me,”
cried
dough-boy
“it
was
aunt
charity
that
brought
the
ginger
on
board
and
bade
me
never
give
the
harpooneers
any
spirits
but
only
this
ginger-jub—so
she
called
it.”
“ginger-jub
you
gingerly
rascal
take
that
and
run
along
with
ye
to
the
lockers
and
get
something
better
i
hope
i
do
no
wrong
mr
starbuck
it
is
the
captain’s
orders—grog
for
the
harpooneer
on
a
whale.”
“enough,”
replied
starbuck
“only
don’t
hit
him
again
but—”
“oh
i
never
hurt
when
i
hit
except
when
i
hit
a
whale
or
something
of
that
sort
and
this
fellow’s
a
weazel
what
were
you
about
saying
sir?”
“only
this
go
down
with
him
and
get
what
thou
wantest
thyself.”
when
stubb
reappeared
he
came
with
a
dark
flask
in
one
hand
and
a
sort
of
tea-caddy
in
the
other
the
first
contained
strong
spirits
and
was
handed
to
queequeg
the
second
was
aunt

gift
and
that
was
freely

stubb
and

kill
a
right
whale
and
then
have
a
talk
over
him
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
all
this
time
we
have
a
sperm
whale’s
prodigious
head
hanging
to
the
pequod’s
side
but
we
must
let
it
continue
hanging
there
a
while
till
we
can
get
a
chance
to
attend
to
it
for
the
present
other
matters

and
the
best
we
can
do
now
for
the
head
is
to
pray
heaven
the
tackles
may
hold
now
during
the
past
night
and
forenoon
the
pequod
had
gradually
drifted
into
a
sea
which
by
its
occasional
patches
of
yellow
brit
gave
unusual
tokens
of
the
vicinity
of
right
whales
a
species
of
the
leviathan
that
but
few
supposed
to
be
at
this
particular
time
lurking
anywhere
near
and
though
all
hands
commonly
disdained
the
capture
of
those
inferior
creatures
and
though
the
pequod
was
not
commissioned
to
cruise
for
them
at
all
and
though
she
had
passed
numbers
of
them
near
the
crozetts
without
lowering
a
boat
yet
now
that
a
sperm
whale
had
been
brought
alongside
and
beheaded
to
the
surprise
of
all
the
announcement
was
made
that
a
right
whale
should
be
captured
that
day
if
opportunity
offered
nor
was
this
long
wanting
tall
spouts
were
seen
to
leeward
and
two
boats
stubb’s
and
flask’s
were
detached
in
pursuit
pulling
further
and
further
away
they
at
last
became
almost
invisible
to
the
men
at
the
mast-head
but
suddenly
in
the
distance
they
saw
a
great
heap
of
tumultuous
white
water
and
soon
after
news
came
from
aloft
that
one
or
both
the
boats
must
be
fast
an
interval
passed
and
the
boats
were
in
plain
sight
in
the
act
of
being
dragged
right
towards
the
ship
by
the
towing
whale
so
close
did
the
monster
come
to
the
hull
that
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
he
meant
it
malice
but
suddenly
going
down
in
a
maelstrom
within
three
rods
of
the
planks
he
wholly
disappeared
from
view
as
if
diving
under
the
keel
“cut
cut!”
was
the
cry
from
the
ship
to
the
boats
which
for
one
instant
seemed
on
the
point
of
being
brought
with
a
deadly
dash
against
the
vessel’s
side
but
having
plenty
of
line
yet
in
the
tubs
and
the
whale
not
sounding
very
rapidly
they
paid
out
abundance
of
rope
and
at
the
same
time
pulled
with
all
their
might
so
as
to
get
ahead
of
the
ship
for
a
few
minutes
the
struggle
was
intensely
critical
for
while
they
still
slacked
out
the
tightened
line
in
one
direction
and
still
plied
their
oars
in
another
the
contending
strain
threatened
to
take
them
under
but
it
was
only
a
few
feet
advance
they
sought
to
gain
and
they
stuck
to
it
till
they
did
gain
it
when
instantly
a
swift
tremor
was
felt
running
like
lightning
along
the
keel
as
the
strained
line
scraping
beneath
the
ship
suddenly
rose
to
view
under
her
bows
snapping
and
quivering
and
so
flinging
off
its
drippings
that
the
drops
fell
like
bits
of
broken
glass
on
the
water
while
the
whale
beyond
also
rose
to
sight
and
once
more
the
boats
were
free
to
fly
but
the
fagged
whale
abated
his
speed
and
blindly
altering
his
course
went
round
the
stern
of
the
ship
towing
the
two
boats
after
him
so
that
they
performed
a
complete
circuit
meantime
they
hauled
more
and
more
upon
their
lines
till
close
flanking
him
on
both
sides
stubb
answered
flask
with
lance
for
lance
and
thus
round
and
round
the
pequod
the
battle
went
while
the
multitudes
of
sharks
that
had
before
swum
round
the
sperm
whale’s
body
rushed
to
the
fresh
blood
that
was
spilled
thirstily
drinking
at
every
new
gash
as
the
eager
israelites
did
at
the
new
bursting
fountains
that
poured
from
the
smitten
rock
at
last
his
spout
grew
thick
and
with
a
frightful
roll
and
vomit
he
turned
upon
his
back
a
corpse
while
the
two
headsmen
were
engaged
in
making
fast
cords
to
his
flukes
and
in
other
ways
getting
the
mass
in
readiness
for
towing
some
conversation
ensued
between
them
“i
wonder
what
the
old
man
wants
with
this
lump
of
foul
lard,”
said
stubb
not
without
some
disgust
at
the
thought
of
having
to
do
with
so
ignoble
a
leviathan
“wants
with
it?”
said
flask
coiling
some
spare
line
in
the
boat’s
bow
“did
you
never
hear
that
the
ship
which
but
once
has
a
sperm
whale’s
head
hoisted
on
her
starboard
side
and
at
the
same
time
a
right
whale’s
on
the
larboard
did
you
never
hear
stubb
that
that
ship
can
never
afterwards
capsize?”
“why
not
“i
don’t
know
but
i
heard
that
gamboge
ghost
of
a
fedallah
saying
so
and
he
seems
to
know
all
about
ships’
charms
but
i
sometimes
think
he’ll
charm
the
ship
to
no
good
at
last
i
don’t
half
like
that
chap
stubb
did
you
ever
notice
how
that
tusk
of
his
is
a
sort
of
carved
into
a
snake’s
head
stubb?”
“sink
him
i
never
look
at
him
at
all
but
if
ever
i
get
a
chance
of
a
dark
night
and
he
standing
hard
by
the
bulwarks
and
no
one
by
look
down
there
flask”—pointing
into
the
sea
with
a
peculiar
motion
of
both
hands—“aye
will
i
flask
i
take
that
fedallah
to
be
the
devil
in
disguise
do
you
believe
that
cock
and
bull
story
about
his
having
been
stowed
away
on
board
ship
he’s
the
devil
i
say
the
reason
why
you
don’t
see
his
tail
is
because
he
tucks
it
up
out
of
sight
he
carries
it
coiled
away
in
his
pocket
i
guess
blast
him
now
that
i
think
of
it
he’s
always
wanting
oakum
to
stuff
into
the
toes
of
his
boots.”
“he
sleeps
in
his
boots
don’t
he
he
hasn’t
got
any
hammock
but
i’ve
seen
him
lay
of
nights
in
a
coil
of
rigging.”
“no
doubt
and
it’s
because
of
his
cursed
tail
he
coils
it
down
do
ye
see
in
the
eye
of
the
rigging.”
“what’s
the
old
man
have
so
much
to
do
with
him
for?”
“striking
up
a
swap
or
a
bargain
i
suppose.”
“bargain?—about
what?”
“why
do
ye
see
the
old
man
is
hard
bent
after
that
white
whale
and
the
devil
there
is
trying
to
come
round
him
and
get
him
to
swap
away
his
silver
watch
or
his
soul
or
something
of
that
sort
and
then
he’ll
surrender
moby
dick.”
“pooh
stubb
you
are
skylarking
how
can
fedallah
do
that?”
“i
don’t
know
flask
but
the
devil
is
a
curious
chap
and
a
wicked
one
i
tell
ye
why
they
say
as
how
he
went
a
sauntering
into
the
old
flag-ship
once
switching
his
tail
about
devilish
easy
and
gentlemanlike
and
inquiring
if
the
old
governor
was
at
home
well
he
was
at
home
and
asked
the
devil
what
he
wanted
the
devil
switching
his
hoofs
up
and
says
‘i
want
john.’
‘what
for?’
says
the
old
governor
‘what
business
is
that
of
yours,’
says
the
devil
getting
mad,—‘i
want
to
use
him.’
‘take
him,’
says
the
governor—and
by
the
lord
flask
if
the
devil
didn’t
give
john
the
asiatic
cholera
before
he
got
through
with
him
i’ll
eat
this
whale
in
one
mouthful
but
look
sharp—ain’t
you
all
ready
there
well
then
pull
ahead
and
let’s
get
the
whale
alongside.”
“i
think
i
remember
some
such
story
as
you
were
telling,”
said
flask
when
at
last
the
two
boats
were
slowly
advancing
with
their
burden
towards
the
ship
“but
i
can’t
remember
where.”
“three
spaniards
adventures
of
those
three
bloody-minded
soldadoes
did
ye
read
it
there
flask
i
guess
ye
did?”
“no
never
saw
such
a
book
heard
of
it
though
but
now
tell
me
stubb
do
you
suppose
that
that
devil
you
was
speaking
of
just
now
was
the
same
you
say
is
now
on
board
the
pequod?”
“am
i
the
same
man
that
helped
kill
this
whale
doesn’t
the
devil
live
for
ever
who
ever
heard
that
the
devil
was
dead
did
you
ever
see
any
parson
a
wearing
mourning
for
the
devil
and
if
the
devil
has
a
latch-key
to
get
into
the
admiral’s
cabin
don’t
you
suppose
he
can
crawl
into
a
porthole
tell
me
that
mr
flask?”
“how
old
do
you
suppose
fedallah
is
stubb?”
“do
you
see
that
mainmast
there?”
pointing
to
the
ship
“well
that’s
the
figure
one
now
take
all
the
hoops
in
the
pequod’s
hold
and
string
along
in
a
row
with
that
mast
for
oughts
do
you
see
well
that
wouldn’t
begin
to
be
fedallah’s
age
nor
all
the
coopers
in
creation
couldn’t
show
hoops
enough
to
make
oughts
enough.”
“but
see
here
stubb
i
thought
you
a
little
boasted
just
now
that
you
meant
to
give
fedallah
a
sea-toss
if
you
got
a
good
chance
now
if
he’s
so
old
as
all
those
hoops
of
yours
come
to
and
if
he
is
going
to
live
for
ever
what
good
will
it
do
to
pitch
him
overboard—tell
me
that
“give
him
a
good
ducking
anyhow.”
“but
he’d
crawl
back.”
“duck
him
again
and
keep
ducking
him.”
“suppose
he
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
duck
you
though—yes
and
drown
you—what
then?”
“i
should
like
to
see
him
try
it
i’d
give
him
such
a
pair
of
black
eyes
that
he
wouldn’t
dare
to
show
his
face
in
the
admiral’s
cabin
again
for
a
long
while
let
alone
down
in
the
orlop
there
where
he
lives
and
hereabouts
on
the
upper
decks
where
he
sneaks
so
much
damn
the
devil
flask
so
you
suppose
i’m
afraid
of
the
devil
who’s
afraid
of
him
except
the
old
governor
who
daresn’t
catch
him
and
put
him
in
double-darbies
as
he
deserves
but
lets
him
go
about
kidnapping
people
aye
and
signed
a
bond
with
him
that
all
the
people
the
devil
kidnapped
he’d
roast
for
him
there’s
a
governor!”
“do
you
suppose
fedallah
wants
to
kidnap
captain
ahab?”
“do
i
suppose
it
you’ll
know
it
before
long
flask
but
i
am
going
now
to
keep
a
sharp
look-out
on
him
and
if
i
see
anything
very
suspicious
going
on
i’ll
just
take
him
by
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
say—look
here
beelzebub
you
don’t
do
it
and
if
he
makes
any
fuss
by
the
lord
i’ll
make
a
grab
into
his
pocket
for
his
tail
take
it
to
the
capstan
and
give
him
such
a
wrenching
and
heaving
that
his
tail
will
come
short
off
at
the
stump—do
you
see
and
then
i
rather
guess
when
he
finds
himself
docked
in
that
queer
fashion
he’ll
sneak
off
without
the
poor
satisfaction
of
feeling
his
tail
between
his
legs.”
“and
what
will
you
do
with
the
tail
stubb?”
“do
with
it
sell
it
for
an
ox
whip
when
we
get
home;—what
else?”
“now
do
you
mean
what
you
say
and
have
been
saying
all
along
stubb?”
“mean
or
not
mean
here
we
are
at
the
ship.”
the
boats
were
here
hailed
to
tow
the
whale
on
the
larboard
side
where
fluke
chains
and
other
necessaries
were
already
prepared
for
securing
him
“didn’t
i
tell
you
so?”
said
flask
“yes
you’ll
soon
see
this
right
whale’s
head
hoisted
up
opposite
that
parmacetti’s.”
in
good
time
flask’s
saying
proved
true
as
before
the
pequod
steeply
leaned
over
towards
the
sperm
whale’s
head
now
by
the
counterpoise
of
both
heads
she
regained
her
even
keel
though
sorely
strained
you
may
well
believe
so
when
on
one
side
you
hoist
in
locke’s
head
you
go
over
that
way
but
now
on
the
other
side
hoist
in
kant’s
and
you
come
back
again
but
in
very
poor
plight
thus
some
minds
for
ever
keep
trimming
boat
oh
ye
foolish
throw
all
these
thunder-heads
overboard
and
then
you
will
float
light
and
right
in
disposing
of
the
body
of
a
right
whale
when
brought
alongside
the
ship
the
same
preliminary
proceedings
commonly
take
place
as
in
the
case
of
a
sperm
whale
only
in
the
latter
instance
the
head
is
cut
off
whole
but
in
the
former
the
lips
and
tongue
are
separately
removed
and
hoisted
on
deck
with
all
the
well
known
black
bone
attached
to
what
is
called
the
crown-piece
but
nothing
like
this
in
the
present
case
had
been
done
the
carcases
of
both
whales
had
dropped
astern
and
the
head-laden
ship
not
a
little
resembled
a
mule
carrying
a
pair
of
overburdening
panniers
meantime
fedallah
was
calmly
eyeing
the
right
whale’s
head
and
ever
and
anon
glancing
from
the
deep
wrinkles
there
to
the
lines
in
his
own
hand
and
ahab
chanced
so
to
stand
that
the
parsee
occupied
his
shadow
while
if
the
parsee’s
shadow
was
there
at
all
it
seemed
only
to
blend
with
and
lengthen
ahab’s
as
the
crew
toiled
on
laplandish
speculations
were
bandied
among
them
concerning
all
these
passing
things
chapter
74
the
sperm
whale’s
head—contrasted
view
here
now
are
two
great
whales
laying
their
heads
together
let
us
join
them
and
lay
together
our
own
of
the
grand
order
of
folio
leviathans
the
sperm
whale
and
the
right
whale
are
by
far
the
most
noteworthy
they
are
the
only
whales
regularly
hunted
by
man
to
the
nantucketer
they
present
the
two
extremes
of
all
the
known
varieties
of
the
whale
as
the
external
difference
between
them
is
mainly
observable
in
their
heads
and
as
a
head
of
each
is
this
moment
hanging
from
the
pequod’s
side
and
as
we
may
freely
go
from
one
to
the
other
by
merely
stepping
across
the
deck:—where
i
should
like
to
know
will
you
obtain
a
better
chance
to
study
practical
cetology
than
here
in
the
first
place
you
are
struck
by
the
general
contrast
between
these
heads
both
are
massive
enough
in
all
conscience
but
there
is
a
certain
mathematical
symmetry
in
the
sperm
whale’s
which
the
right
whale’s
sadly
lacks
there
is
more
character
in
the
sperm
whale’s
head
as
you
behold
it
you
involuntarily
yield
the
immense
superiority
to
him
in
point
of
pervading
dignity
in
the
present
instance
too
this
dignity
is
heightened
by
the
pepper
and
salt
colour
of
his
head
at
the
summit
giving
token
of
advanced
age
and
large
experience
in
short
he
is
what
the
fishermen
technically
call
a
“grey-headed
whale.”
let
us
now
note
what
is
least
dissimilar
in
these
heads—namely
the
two
most
important
organs
the
eye
and
the
ear
far
back
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
low
down
near
the
angle
of
either
whale’s
jaw
if
you
narrowly
search
you
will
at
last
see
a
lashless
eye
which
you
would
fancy
to
be
a
young
colt’s
eye
so
out
of
all
proportion
is
it
to
the
magnitude
of
the
head
now
from
this
peculiar
sideway
position
of
the
whale’s
eyes
it
is
plain
that
he
can
never
see
an
object
which
is
exactly
ahead
no
more
than
he
can
one
exactly
astern
in
a
word
the
position
of
the
whale’s
eyes
corresponds
to
that
of
a
man’s
ears
and
you
may
fancy
for
yourself
how
it
would
fare
with
you
did
you
sideways
survey
objects
through
your
ears
you
would
find
that
you
could
only
command
some
thirty
degrees
of
vision
in
advance
of
the
straight
side-line
of
sight
and
about
thirty
more
behind
it
if
your
bitterest
foe
were
walking
straight
towards
you
with
dagger
uplifted
in
broad
day
you
would
not
be
able
to
see
him
any
more
than
if
he
were
stealing
upon
you
from
behind
in
a
word
you
would
have
two
backs
so
to
speak
but
at
the
same
time
also
two
fronts
side
fronts
for
what
is
it
that
makes
the
front
of
a
man—what
indeed
but
his
eyes
moreover
while
in
most
other
animals
that
i
can
now
think
of
the
eyes
are
so
planted
as
imperceptibly
to
blend
their
visual
power
so
as
to
produce
one
picture
and
not
two
to
the
brain
the
peculiar
position
of
the
whale’s
eyes
effectually
divided
as
they
are
by
many
cubic
feet
of
solid
head
which
towers
between
them
like
a
great
mountain
separating
two
lakes
in
valleys
this
of
course
must
wholly
separate
the
impressions
which
each
independent
organ
imparts
the
whale
therefore
must
see
one
distinct
picture
on
this
side
and
another
distinct
picture
on
that
side
while
all
between
must
be
profound
darkness
and
nothingness
to
him
man
may
in
effect
be
said
to
look
out
on
the
world
from
a
sentry-box
with
two
joined
sashes
for
his
window
but
with
the
whale
these
two
sashes
are
separately
inserted
making
two
distinct
windows
but
sadly
impairing
the
view
this
peculiarity
of
the
whale’s
eyes
is
a
thing
always
to
be
borne
in
mind
in
the
fishery
and
to
be
remembered
by
the
reader
in
some
subsequent
scenes
a
curious
and
most
puzzling
question
might
be
started
concerning
this
visual
matter
as
touching
the
leviathan
but
i
must
be
content
with
a
hint
so
long
as
a
man’s
eyes
are
open
in
the
light
the
act
of
seeing
is
involuntary
that
is
he
cannot
then
help
mechanically
seeing
whatever
objects
are
before
him
nevertheless
any
one’s
experience
will
teach
him
that
though
he
can
take
in
an
undiscriminating
sweep
of
things
at
one
glance
it
is
quite
impossible
for
him
attentively
and
completely
to
examine
any
two
things—however
large
or
however
small—at
one
and
the
same
instant
of
time
never
mind
if
they
lie
side
by
side
and
touch
each
other
but
if
you
now
come
to
separate
these
two
objects
and
surround
each
by
a
circle
of
profound
darkness
then
in
order
to
see
one
of
them
in
such
a
manner
as
to
bring
your
mind
to
bear
on
it
the
other
will
be
utterly
excluded
from
your
contemporary
consciousness
how
is
it
then
with
the
whale
true
both
his
eyes
in
themselves
must
simultaneously
act
but
is
his
brain
so
much
more
comprehensive
combining
and
subtle
than
man’s
that
he
can
at
the
same
moment
of
time
attentively
examine
two
distinct
prospects
one
on
one
side
of
him
and
the
other
in
an
exactly
opposite
direction
if
he
can
then
is
it
as
marvellous
a
thing
in
him
as
if
a
man
were
able
simultaneously
to
go
through
the
demonstrations
of
two
distinct
problems
in
euclid
nor
strictly
investigated
is
there
any
incongruity
in
this
comparison
it
may
be
but
an
idle
whim
but
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
extraordinary
vacillations
of
movement
displayed
by
some
whales
when
beset
by
three
or
four
boats
the
timidity
and
liability
to
queer
frights
so
common
to
such
whales
i
think
that
all
this
indirectly
proceeds
from
the
helpless
perplexity
of
volition
in
which
their
divided
and
diametrically
opposite
powers
of
vision
must
involve
them
but
the
ear
of
the
whale
is
full
as
curious
as
the
eye
if
you
are
an
entire
stranger
to
their
race
you
might
hunt
over
these
two
heads
for
hours
and
never
discover
that
organ
the
ear
has
no
external
leaf
whatever
and
into
the
hole
itself
you
can
hardly
insert
a
quill
so
wondrously
minute
is
it
it
is
lodged
a
little
behind
the
eye
with
respect
to
their
ears
this
important
difference
is
to
be
observed
between
the
sperm
whale
and
the
right
while
the
ear
of
the
former
has
an
external
opening
that
of
the
latter
is
entirely
and
evenly
covered
over
with
a
membrane
so
as
to
be
quite
imperceptible
from
without
is
it
not
curious
that
so
vast
a
being
as
the
whale
should
see
the
world
through
so
small
an
eye
and
hear
the
thunder
through
an
ear
which
is
smaller
than
a
hare’s
but
if
his
eyes
were
broad
as
the
lens
of
herschel’s
great
telescope
and
his
ears
capacious
as
the
porches
of
cathedrals
would
that
make
him
any
longer
of
sight
or
sharper
of
hearing
not
at
all.—why
then
do
you
try
to
“enlarge”
your
mind
subtilize
it
let
us
now
with
whatever
levers
and
steam-engines
we
have
at
hand
cant
over
the
sperm
whale’s
head
that
it
may
lie
bottom
up
then
ascending
by
a
ladder
to
the
summit
have
a
peep
down
the
mouth
and
were
it
not
that
the
body
is
now
completely
separated
from
it
with
a
lantern
we
might
descend
into
the
great
kentucky
mammoth
cave
of
his
stomach
but
let
us
hold
on
here
by
this
tooth
and
look
about
us
where
we
are
what
a
really
beautiful
and
chaste-looking
mouth
from
floor
to
ceiling
lined
or
rather
papered
with
a
glistening
white
membrane
glossy
as
bridal
satins
but
come
out
now
and
look
at
this
portentous
lower
jaw
which
seems
like
the
long
narrow
lid
of
an
immense
snuff-box
with
the
hinge
at
one
end
instead
of
one
side
if
you
pry
it
up
so
as
to
get
it
overhead
and
expose
its
rows
of
teeth
it
seems
a
terrific
portcullis
and
such
alas
it
proves
to
many
a
poor
wight
in
the
fishery
upon
whom
these
spikes
fall
with
impaling
force
but
far
more
terrible
is
it
to
behold
when
fathoms
down
in
the
sea
you
see
some
sulky
whale
floating
there
suspended
with
his
prodigious
jaw
some
fifteen
feet
long
hanging
straight
down
at
right-angles
with
his
body
for
all
the
world
like
a
ship’s
jib-boom
this
whale
is
not
dead
he
is
only
dispirited
out
of
sorts
perhaps
hypochondriac
and
so
supine
that
the
hinges
of
his
jaw
have
relaxed
leaving
him
there
in
that
ungainly
sort
of
plight
a
reproach
to
all
his
tribe
who
must
no
doubt
imprecate
lock-jaws
upon
him
in
most
cases
this
lower
jaw—being
easily
unhinged
by
a
practised
artist—is
disengaged
and
hoisted
on
deck
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
the
ivory
teeth
and
furnishing
a
supply
of
that
hard
white
whalebone
with
which
the
fishermen
fashion
all
sorts
of
curious
articles
including
canes
umbrella-stocks
and
handles
to
riding-whips
with
a
long
weary
hoist
the
jaw
is
dragged
on
board
as
if
it
were
an
anchor
and
when
the
proper
time
comes—some
few
days
after
the
other
work—queequeg
daggoo
and
tashtego
being
all
accomplished
dentists
are
set
to
drawing
teeth
with

the
right
whale’s
head—contrasted
view
crossing
the
deck
let
us
now
have
a
good
long
look
at
the
right
whale’s
head
as
in
general
shape
the
noble
sperm
whale’s
head
may
be
compared
to
a
roman
war-chariot
especially
in
front
where
it
is
so
broadly
rounded
so
at
a
broad
view
the
right
whale’s
head
bears
a
rather
inelegant
resemblance
to
a
gigantic
galliot-toed
shoe
two
hundred
years
ago
an
old
dutch
voyager
likened
its
shape
to
that
of
a
shoemaker’s
last
and
in
this
same
last
or
shoe
that
old
woman
of
the
nursery
tale
with
the
swarming
brood
might
very
comfortably
be
lodged
she
and
all
her
progeny
but
as
you
come
nearer
to
this
great
head
it
begins
to
assume
different
aspects
according
to
your
point
of
view
if
you
stand
on
its
summit
and
look
at
these
two
f-shaped
spoutholes
you
would
take
the
whole
head
for
an
enormous
bass-viol
and
these
spiracles
the
apertures
in
its
sounding-board
then
again
if
you
fix
your
eye
upon
this
strange
crested
comb-like
incrustation
on
the
top
of
the
mass—this
green
barnacled
thing
which
the
greenlanders
call
the
“crown,”
and
the
southern
fishers
the
“bonnet”
of
the
right
whale
fixing
your
eyes
solely
on
this
you
would
take
the
head
for
the
trunk
of
some
huge
oak
with
a
bird’s
nest
in
its
crotch
at
any
rate
when
you
watch
those
live
crabs
that
nestle
here
on
this
bonnet
such
an
idea
will
be
almost
sure
to
occur
to
you
unless
indeed
your
fancy
has
been
fixed
by
the
technical
term
“crown”
also
bestowed
upon
it
in
which
case
you
will
take
great
interest
in
thinking
how
this
mighty
monster
is
actually
a
diademed
king
of
the
sea
whose
green
crown
has
been
put
together
for
him
in
this
marvellous
manner
but
if
this
whale
be
a
king
he
is
a
very
sulky
looking
fellow
to
grace
a
diadem
look
at
that
hanging
lower
lip
what
a
huge
sulk
and
pout
is
there
a
sulk
and
pout
by
carpenter’s
measurement
about
twenty
feet
long
and
five
feet
deep
a
sulk
and
pout
that
will
yield
you
some
500
gallons
of
oil
and
more
a
great
pity
now
that
this
unfortunate
whale
should
be
hare-lipped
the
fissure
is
about
a
foot
across
probably
the
mother
during
an
important
interval
was
sailing
down
the
peruvian
coast
when
earthquakes
caused
the
beach
to
gape
over
this
lip
as
over
a
slippery
threshold
we
now
slide
into
the
mouth
upon
my
word
were
i
at
mackinaw
i
should
take
this
to
be
the
inside
of
an
indian
wigwam
good
lord
is
this
the
road
that
jonah
went
the
roof
is
about
twelve
feet
high
and
runs
to
a
pretty
sharp
angle
as
if
there
were
a
regular
ridge-pole
there
while
these
ribbed
arched
hairy
sides
present
us
with
those
wondrous
half
vertical
scimetar-shaped
slats
of
whalebone
say
three
hundred
on
a
side
which
depending
from
the
upper
part
of
the
head
or
crown
bone
form
those
venetian
blinds
which
have
elsewhere
been
cursorily
mentioned
the
edges
of
these
bones
are
fringed
with
hairy
fibres
through
which
the
right
whale
strains
the
water
and
in
whose
intricacies
he
retains
the
small
fish
when
openmouthed
he
goes
through
the
seas
of
brit
in
feeding
time
in
the
central
blinds
of
bone
as
they
stand
in
their
natural
order
there
are
certain
curious
marks
curves
hollows
and
ridges
whereby
some
whalemen
calculate
the
creature’s
age
as
the
age
of
an
oak
by
its
circular
rings
though
the
certainty
of
this
criterion
is
far
from
demonstrable
yet
it
has
the
savor
of
analogical
probability
at
any
rate
if
we
yield
to
it
we
must
grant
a
far
greater
age
to
the
right
whale
than
at
first
glance
will
seem
reasonable
in
old
times
there
seem
to
have
prevailed
the
most
curious
fancies
concerning
these
blinds
one
voyager
in
purchas
calls
them
the
wondrous
“whiskers”
inside
of
the
whale’s
mouth;*
another
“hogs’
bristles”
a
third
old
gentleman
in
hackluyt
uses
the
following
elegant
language
“there
are
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
fins
growing
on
each
side
of
his
upper
_chop_
which
arch
over
his
tongue
on
each
side
of
his
mouth.”
*this
reminds
us
that
the
right
whale
really
has
a
sort
of
whisker
or
rather
a
moustache
consisting
of
a
few
scattered
white
hairs
on
the
upper
part
of
the
outer
end
of
the
lower
jaw
sometimes
these
tufts
impart
a
rather
brigandish
expression
to
his
otherwise
solemn
countenance
as
every
one
knows
these
same
“hogs’
bristles,”
“fins,”
“whiskers,”
“blinds,”
or
whatever
you
please
furnish
to
the
ladies
their
busks
and
other
stiffening
contrivances
but
in
this
particular
the
demand
has
long
been
on
the
decline
it
was
in
queen
anne’s
time
that
the
bone
was
in
its
glory
the
farthingale
being
then
all
the
fashion
and
as
those
ancient
dames
moved
about
gaily
though
in
the
jaws
of
the
whale
as
you
may
say
even
so
in
a
shower
with
the
like
thoughtlessness
do
we
nowadays
fly
under
the
same
jaws
for
protection
the
umbrella
being
a
tent
spread
over
the
same
bone
but
now
forget
all
about
blinds
and
whiskers
for
a
moment
and
standing
in
the
right
whale’s
mouth
look
around
you
afresh
seeing
all
these
colonnades
of
bone
so
methodically
ranged
about
would
you
not
think
you
were
inside
of
the
great
haarlem
organ
and
gazing
upon
its
thousand
pipes
for
a
carpet
to
the
organ
we
have
a
rug
of
the
softest
turkey—the
tongue
which
is
glued
as
it
were
to
the
floor
of
the
mouth
it
is
very
fat
and
tender
and
apt
to
tear
in
pieces
in
hoisting
it
on
deck
this
particular
tongue
now
before
us
at
a
passing
glance
i
should
say
it
was
a
six-barreler
that
is
it
will
yield
you
about
that
amount
of
oil
ere
this
you
must
have
plainly
seen
the
truth
of
what
i
started
with—that
the
sperm
whale
and
the
right
whale
have
almost
entirely
different
heads
to
sum
up
then
in
the
right
whale’s
there
is
no
great
well
of
sperm
no
ivory
teeth
at
all
no
long
slender
mandible
of
a
lower
jaw
like
the
sperm
whale’s
nor
in
the
sperm
whale
are
there
any
of
those
blinds
of
bone
no
huge
lower
lip
and
scarcely
anything
of
a
tongue
again
the
right
whale
has
two
external
spout-holes
the
sperm
whale
only
one
look
your
last
now
on
these
venerable
hooded
heads
while
they
yet
lie
together
for
one
will
soon
sink
unrecorded
in
the
sea
the
other
will
not
be
very
long
in
following
can
you
catch
the
expression
of
the
sperm
whale’s
there
it
is
the
same
he
died
with
only
some
of
the
longer
wrinkles
in
the
forehead
seem
now
faded
away
i
think
his
broad
brow
to
be
full
of
a
prairie-like
placidity
born
of
a
speculative
indifference
as
to
death
but
mark
the
other
head’s
expression
see
that
amazing
lower
lip
pressed
by
accident
against
the
vessel’s
side
so
as
firmly
to
embrace
the
jaw
does
not
this
whole
head
seem
to
speak
of
an
enormous
practical
resolution
in
facing
death
this
right
whale
i
take
to
have
been
a
stoic
the
sperm
whale
a
platonian
who
might
have
taken
up
spinoza
in
his
latter
years
chapter
76
the
battering-ram
ere
quitting
for
the
nonce
the
sperm
whale’s
head
i
would
have
you
as
a
sensible
physiologist
simply—particularly
remark
its
front
aspect
in
all
its
compacted
collectedness
i
would
have
you
investigate
it
now
with
the
sole
view
of
forming
to
yourself
some
unexaggerated
intelligent
estimate
of
whatever
battering-ram
power
may
be
lodged
there
here
is
a
vital
point
for
you
must
either
satisfactorily
settle
this
matter
with
yourself
or
for
ever
remain
an
infidel
as
to
one
of
the
most
appalling
but
not
the
less
true
events
perhaps
anywhere
to
be
found
in
all
recorded
history
you
observe
that
in
the
ordinary
swimming
position
of
the
sperm
whale
the
front
of
his
head
presents
an
almost
wholly
vertical
plane
to
the
water
you
observe
that
the
lower
part
of
that
front
slopes
considerably
backwards
so
as
to
furnish
more
of
a
retreat
for
the
long
socket
which
receives
the
boom-like
lower
jaw
you
observe
that
the
mouth
is
entirely
under
the
head
much
in
the
same
way
indeed
as
though
your
own
mouth
were
entirely
under
your
chin
moreover
you
observe
that
the
whale
has
no
external
nose
and
that
what
nose
he
has—his
spout
hole—is
on
the
top
of
his
head
you
observe
that
his
eyes
and
ears
are
at
the
sides
of
his
head
nearly
one
third
of
his
entire
length
from
the
front
wherefore
you
must
now
have
perceived
that
the
front
of
the
sperm
whale’s
head
is
a
dead
blind
wall
without
a
single
organ
or
tender
prominence
of
any
sort
whatsoever
furthermore
you
are
now
to
consider
that
only
in
the
extreme
lower
backward
sloping
part
of
the
front
of
the
head
is
there
the
slightest
vestige
of
bone
and
not
till
you
get
near
twenty
feet
from
the
forehead
do
you
come
to
the
full
cranial
development
so
that
this
whole
enormous
boneless
mass
is
as
one
wad
finally
though
as
will
soon
be
revealed
its
contents
partly
comprise
the
most
delicate
oil
yet
you
are
now
to
be
apprised
of
the
nature
of
the
substance
which
so
impregnably
invests
all
that
apparent
effeminacy
in
some
previous
place
i
have
described
to
you
how
the
blubber
wraps
the
body
of
the
whale
as
the
rind
wraps
an
orange
just
so
with
the
head
but
with
this
difference
about
the
head
this
envelope
though
not
so
thick
is
of
a
boneless
toughness
inestimable
by
any
man
who
has
not
handled
it
the
severest
pointed
harpoon
the
sharpest
lance
darted
by
the
strongest
human
arm
impotently
rebounds
from
it
it
is
as
though
the
forehead
of
the
sperm
whale
were
paved
with
horses’
hoofs
i
do
not
think
that
any
sensation
lurks
in
it
bethink
yourself
also
of
another
thing
when
two
large
loaded
indiamen
chance
to
crowd
and
crush
towards
each
other
in
the
docks
what
do
the
sailors
do
they
do
not
suspend
between
them
at
the
point
of
coming
contact
any
merely
hard
substance
like
iron
or
wood
no
they
hold
there
a
large
round
wad
of
tow
and
cork
enveloped
in
the
thickest
and
toughest
of
ox-hide
that
bravely
and
uninjured
takes
the
jam
which
would
have
snapped
all
their
oaken
handspikes
and
iron
crow-bars
by
itself
this
sufficiently
illustrates
the
obvious
fact
i
drive
at
but
supplementary
to
this
it
has
hypothetically
occurred
to
me
that
as
ordinary
fish
possess
what
is
called
a
swimming
bladder
in
them
capable
at
will
of
distension
or
contraction
and
as
the
sperm
whale
as
far
as
i
know
has
no
such
provision
in
him
considering
too
the
otherwise
inexplicable
manner
in
which
he
now
depresses
his
head
altogether
beneath
the
surface
and
anon
swims
with
it
high
elevated
out
of
the
water
considering
the
unobstructed
elasticity
of
its
envelope
considering
the
unique
interior
of
his
head
it
has
hypothetically
occurred
to
me
i
say
that
those
mystical
lung-celled
honeycombs
there
may
possibly
have
some
hitherto
unknown
and
unsuspected
connexion
with
the
outer
air
so
as
to
be
susceptible
to
atmospheric
distension
and
contraction
if
this
be
so
fancy
the
irresistibleness
of
that
might
to
which
the
most
impalpable
and
destructive
of
all
elements
contributes
now
mark
unerringly
impelling
this
dead
impregnable
uninjurable
wall
and
this
most
buoyant
thing
within
there
swims
behind
it
all
a
mass
of
tremendous
life
only
to
be
adequately
estimated
as
piled
wood
is—by
the
cord
and
all
obedient
to
one
volition
as
the
smallest
insect
so
that
when
i
shall
hereafter
detail
to
you
all
the
specialities
and
concentrations
of
potency
everywhere
lurking
in
this
expansive
monster
when
i
shall
show
you
some
of
his
more
inconsiderable
braining
feats
i
trust
you
will
have
renounced
all
ignorant
incredulity
and
be
ready
to
abide
by
this
that
though
the
sperm
whale
stove
a
passage
through
the
isthmus
of
darien
and
mixed
the
atlantic
with
the
pacific
you
would
not
elevate
one
hair
of
your
eye-brow
for
unless
you
own
the
whale
you
are
but
a
provincial
and
sentimentalist
in
truth
but
clear
truth
is
a
thing
for
salamander
giants
only
to
encounter
how
small
the
chances
for
the
provincials

the
great
heidelburgh
tun
now
comes
the
baling
of
the
case
but
to
comprehend
it
aright
you
must
know
something
of
the
curious
internal
structure
of
the
thing
operated
upon
regarding
the
sperm
whale’s
head
as
a
solid
oblong
you
may
on
an
inclined
plane
sideways
divide
it
into
two
quoins,*
whereof
the
lower
is
the
bony
structure
forming
the
cranium
and
jaws
and
the
upper
an
unctuous
mass
wholly
free
from
bones
its
broad
forward
end
forming
the
expanded
vertical
apparent
forehead
of
the
whale
at
the
middle
of
the
forehead
horizontally
subdivide
this
upper
quoin
and
then
you
have
two
almost
equal
parts
which
before
were
naturally
divided
by
an
internal
wall
of
a
thick
tendinous
substance
*quoin
is
not
a
euclidean
term
it
belongs
to
the
pure
nautical
mathematics
i
know
not
that
it
has
been
defined
before
a
quoin
is
a
solid
which
differs
from
a
wedge
in
having
its
sharp
end
formed
by
the
steep
inclination
of
one
side
instead
of
the
mutual
tapering
of
both
sides
the
lower
subdivided
part
called
the
junk
is
one
immense
honeycomb
of
oil
formed
by
the
crossing
and
recrossing
into
ten
thousand
infiltrated
cells
of
tough
elastic
white
fibres
throughout
its
whole
extent
the
upper
part
known
as
the
case
may
be
regarded
as
the
great
heidelburgh
tun
of
the
sperm
whale
and
as
that
famous
great
tierce
is
mystically
carved
in
front
so
the
whale’s
vast
plaited
forehead
forms
innumerable
strange
devices
for
the
emblematical
adornment
of
his
wondrous
tun
moreover
as
that
of
heidelburgh
was
always
replenished
with
the
most
excellent
of
the
wines
of
the
rhenish
valleys
so
the
tun
of
the
whale
contains
by
far
the
most
precious
of
all
his
oily
vintages
namely
the
highly-prized
spermaceti
in
its
absolutely
pure
limpid
and
odoriferous
state
nor
is
this
precious
substance
found
unalloyed
in
any
other
part
of
the
creature
though
in
life
it
remains
perfectly
fluid
yet
upon
exposure
to
the
air
after
death
it
soon
begins
to
concrete
sending
forth
beautiful
crystalline
shoots
as
when
the
first
thin
delicate
ice
is
just
forming
in
water
a
large
whale’s
case
generally
yields
about
five
hundred
gallons
of
sperm
though
from
unavoidable
circumstances
considerable
of
it
is
spilled
leaks
and
dribbles
away
or
is
otherwise
irrevocably
lost
in
the
ticklish
business
of
securing
what
you
can
i
know
not
with
what
fine
and
costly
material
the
heidelburgh
tun
was
coated
within
but
in
superlative
richness
that
coating
could
not
possibly
have
compared
with
the
silken
pearl-coloured
membrane
like
the
lining
of
a
fine
pelisse
forming
the
inner
surface
of
the
sperm
whale’s
case
it
will
have
been
seen
that
the
heidelburgh
tun
of
the
sperm

the
entire
length
of

entire

elsewhere
set
forth—the

one
third
of
the
whole
length
of

then
setting
that
length
down
at
eighty
feet

a

you
have
more
than
twenty-six
feet
for
the
depth
of
the

when
it
is
lengthwise
hoisted
up
and
down
against
a
ship’s
side

in

the

the

instrument
is
brought
close
to
the

where
an
entrance
is

forced
into
the

he
has
therefore
to
be
uncommonly
heedful
lest
a
careless
untimely
stroke
should
invade
the
sanctuary
and
wastingly
let
out
its
invaluable
contents
it
is
this
decapitated
end
of
the

also
which
is
at
last
elevated
out
of

and
retained
in
that
position
by
the
enormous

combinations
on

make
quite
a
wilderness
of
ropes

nimble
as
a
cat
tashtego
mounts
aloft
and
without
altering
his
erect
posture
runs
straight
out
upon
the
overhanging
mainyard-arm
to
the
part
where
it
exactly
projects
over
the
hoisted
tun
he
has
carried
with
him
a
light
tackle
called
a
whip
consisting
of
only
two
parts
travelling
through
a
single-sheaved
block
securing
this
block
so
that
it
hangs
down
from

swings
one
end
of

till
it
is
caught
and
firmly
held
by
a
hand
on

hand-over-hand
down

drops
through

dexterously
he
lands
on

of
the
head
there—still
high
elevated
above
the
rest
of
the
company
to
whom
he
vivaciously
cries—he
seems
some
turkish
muezzin
calling
the
good
people
to
prayers
from
the
top
of
a
tower
a
short-handled
sharp
spade
being
sent
up
to
him
he
diligently
searches
for
the
proper
place
to
begin
breaking
into
the

in
this
business
he
proceeds
very
heedfully
like
a
treasure-hunter
in
some
old
house
sounding
the
walls
to
find
where
the
gold
is
masoned
in
by
the
time
this
cautious
search
is
over
a
stout
iron-bound

precisely
like

attached
to

the

again
all
bubbling
like
a

pail

milk
carefully
lowered
from

the
full-freighted

caught
by

harder
and
harder

twenty
feet
of
the

have
gone
down

the
people
of
the

had
been
baling
some
time
in
this
way
several
tubs
had
been
filled
with
the
fragrant
sperm
when
all
at
once
a
queer
accident
happened
whether
it
was
that
tashtego
that
wild
indian
was
so
heedless
and
reckless
as
to
let
go
for
a
moment
his
one-handed
hold
on
the
great
cabled
tackles
suspending
the
head
or
whether
the
place
where
he
stood
was
so
treacherous
and
oozy
or
whether
the
evil
one
himself
would
have
it
to
fall
out
so
without
stating
his
particular
reasons
how
it
was
exactly
there
is
no
telling
now
but
on
a
sudden
as
the
eightieth
or
ninetieth
bucket
came
suckingly
up—my
god
poor
tashtego—like
the
twin
reciprocating
bucket
in
a
veritable
well
dropped
head-foremost
down
into
this
great
tun
of
heidelburgh
and
with
a
horrible
oily
gurgling
went
clean
out
of
sight
“man
overboard!”
cried
daggoo
who
amid
the
general
consternation
first
came
to
his
senses
“swing
the
bucket
this
way!”
and
putting
one
foot
into
it
so
as
the
better
to
secure
his
slippery
hand-hold
on
the
whip
itself
the
hoisters
ran
him
high
up
to
the
top
of
the
head
almost
before
tashtego
could
have
reached
its
interior
bottom
meantime
there
was
a
terrible
tumult
looking
over
the
side
they
saw
the
before
lifeless
head
throbbing
and
heaving
just
below
the
surface
of
the
sea
as
if
that
moment
seized
with
some
momentous
idea
whereas
it
was
only
the
poor
indian
unconsciously
revealing
by
those
struggles
the
perilous
depth
to
which
he
had
sunk
at
this
instant
while
daggoo
on
the
summit
of
the
head
was
clearing
the
whip—which
had
somehow
got
foul
of
the
great
cutting
tackles—a
sharp
cracking
noise
was
heard
and
to
the
unspeakable
horror
of
all
one
of
the
two
enormous
hooks
suspending
the
head
tore
out
and
with
a
vast
vibration
the
enormous
mass
sideways
swung
till
the
drunk
ship
reeled
and
shook
as
if
smitten
by
an
iceberg
the
one
remaining
hook
upon
which
the
entire
strain
now
depended
seemed
every
instant
to
be
on
the
point
of
giving
way
an
event
still
more
likely
from
the
violent
motions
of
the
head
“come
down
come
down!”
yelled
the
seamen
to
daggoo
but
with
one
hand
holding
on
to
the
heavy
tackles
so
that
if
the
head
should
drop
he
would
still
remain
suspended
the
negro
having
cleared
the
foul
line
rammed
down
the
bucket
into
the
now
collapsed
well
meaning
that
the
buried
harpooneer
should
grasp
it
and
so
be
hoisted
out
“in
heaven’s
name
man,”
cried
stubb
“are
you
ramming
home
a
cartridge
there?—avast
how
will
that
help
him
jamming
that
iron-bound
bucket
on
top
of
his
head
avast
will
ye!”
“stand
clear
of
the
tackle!”
cried
a
voice
like
the
bursting
of
a
rocket
almost
in
the
same
instant
with
a
thunder-boom
the
enormous
mass
dropped
into
the
sea
like
niagara’s
table-rock
into
the
whirlpool
the
suddenly
relieved
hull
rolled
away
from
it
to
far
down
her
glittering
copper
and
all
caught
their
breath
as
half
swinging—now
over
the
sailors’
heads
and
now
over
the
water—daggoo
through
a
thick
mist
of
spray
was
dimly
beheld
clinging
to
the
pendulous
tackles
while
poor
buried-alive
tashtego
was
sinking
utterly
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
hardly
had
the
blinding
vapor
cleared
away
when
a
naked
figure
with
a
boarding-sword
in
his
hand
was
for
one
swift
moment
seen
hovering
over
the
bulwarks
the
next
a
loud
splash
announced
that
my
brave
queequeg
had
dived
to
the
rescue
one
packed
rush
was
made
to
the
side
and
every
eye
counted
every
ripple
as
moment
followed
moment
and
no
sign
of
either
the
sinker
or
the
diver
could
be
seen
some
hands
now
jumped
into
a
boat
alongside
and
pushed
a
little
off
from
the
ship
“ha
ha!”
cried
daggoo
all
at
once
from
his
now
quiet
swinging
perch
overhead
and
looking
further
off
from
the
side
we
saw
an
arm
thrust
upright
from
the
blue
waves
a
sight
strange
to
see
as
an
arm
thrust
forth
from
the
grass
over
a
grave
“both
both!—it
is
both!”—cried
daggoo
again
with
a
joyful
shout
and
soon
after
queequeg
was
seen
boldly
striking
out
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
clutching
the
long
hair
of
the
indian
drawn
into
the
waiting
boat
they
were
quickly
brought
to
the
deck
but
tashtego
was
long
in
coming
to
and
queequeg
did
not
look
very
brisk
now
how
had
this
noble
rescue
been
accomplished
why
diving
after
the
slowly
descending
head
queequeg
with
his
keen
sword
had
made
side
lunges
near
its
bottom
so
as
to
scuttle
a
large
hole
there
then
dropping
his
sword
had
thrust
his
long
arm
far
inwards
and
upwards
and
so
hauled
out
poor
tash
by
the
head
he
averred
that
upon
first
thrusting
in
for
him
a
leg
was
presented
but
well
knowing
that
that
was
not
as
it
ought
to
be
and
might
occasion
great
trouble;—he
had
thrust
back
the
leg
and
by
a
dexterous
heave
and
toss
had
wrought
a
somerset
upon
the
indian
so
that
with
the
next
trial
he
came
forth
in
the
good
old
way—head
foremost
as
for
the
great
head
itself
that
was
doing
as
well
as
could
be
expected
and
thus
through
the
courage
and
great
skill
in
obstetrics
of
queequeg
the
deliverance
or
rather
delivery
of
tashtego
was
successfully
accomplished
in
the
teeth
too
of
the
most
untoward
and
apparently
hopeless
impediments
which
is
a
lesson
by
no
means
to
be
forgotten
midwifery
should
be
taught
in
the
same
course
with
fencing
and
boxing
riding
and
rowing
i
know
that
this
queer
adventure
of
the
gay-header’s
will
be
sure
to
seem
incredible
to
some
landsmen
though
they
themselves
may
have
either
seen
or
heard
of
some
one’s
falling
into
a
cistern

an
accident
which
not
seldom
happens
and
with
much
less
reason
too
than
the
indian’s

the
exceeding
slipperiness
of
the
curb
of

peradventure
it
may
be
sagaciously
urged
how
is
this
we
thought
the
tissued
infiltrated
head
of
the
sperm
whale
was
the
lightest
and
most
corky
part
about
him
and
yet
thou
makest
it
sink
in
an
element
of
a
far
greater
specific
gravity
than
itself

been
nearly
emptied
of
its
lighter
contents
leaving
little
but
the
dense
tendinous
wall
of
the
well—a
double
welded
hammered
substance
as
i
have
before
said
much
heavier
than
the
sea
water
and
a
lump
of
which
sinks
in
it
like
lead
almost
but
the
tendency
to
rapid
sinking
in
this
substance
was
in
the
present
instance
materially
counteracted
by
the
other
parts
of
the
head
remaining
undetached
from
it
so
that
it
sank
very
slowly
and
deliberately
indeed
affording
queequeg
a
fair
chance
for
performing
his
agile
obstetrics
on
the
run
as
you
may
say
yes
it
was
a
running

be

death
of
an

seeking
honey
in

of
a

found
such
exceeding
store
of

that
leaning

over
it

him
in

physiognomically
regarded
the
sperm
whale
is
an
anomalous
creature
he
has
no
proper
nose
and
since
the
nose
is
the
central
and
most
conspicuous
of
the
features
and
since
it
perhaps
most
modifies
and
finally
controls
their
combined
expression
hence
it
would
seem
that
its
entire
absence
as
an
external
appendage
must
very
largely
affect
the
countenance
of
the
whale
for
as
in

gardening
a
spire
cupola
monument
or
tower
of
some
sort
is
deemed
almost
indispensable
to
the

of

can

in

nose
from

and
what
a
sorry
remainder
nevertheless
leviathan
is
of
so
mighty
a
magnitude
all
his
proportions
are
so
stately
that
the

deficiency
which
in

in

is
no
blemish
at

nay
it
is
an
added

a

to

would
have
been
impertinent
as
on
your
physiognomical
voyage
you
sail
round
his
vast
head
in
your
jolly-boat
your
noble
conceptions
of
him
are
never
insulted
by
the
reflection
that
he
has
a
nose
to
be
pulled
a
pestilent
conceit
which
so
often
will
insist
upon
obtruding
even
when
beholding
the
mightiest
royal
beadle
on
his
throne
in
some
particulars
perhaps
the
most
imposing
physiognomical
view
to
be
had
of
the
sperm
whale
is
that
of
the
full
front
of
his
head
this
aspect
is
sublime
in
thought
a
fine
human
brow
is
like
the
east
when
troubled
with
the
morning
in
the
repose
of
the
pasture
the
curled
brow
of
the
bull
has
a
touch
of
the
grand
in
it
pushing
heavy
cannon
up

defiles
the
elephant’s
brow
is

human
or

the
mystical
brow
is
as
that
great
golden
seal
affixed
by
the
german
emperors
to
their
decrees
it
signifies—“god
done
this
day
by
my
hand.”
but
in
most
creatures
nay
in
man
himself
very
often
the
brow
is
but
a
mere
strip
of
alpine
land
lying
along
the
snow
line
few
are
the
foreheads
which
like
shakespeare’s
or
melancthon’s
rise
so
high
and
descend
so
low
that
the
eyes
themselves
seem
clear
eternal
tideless
mountain
lakes
and
all
above
them
in
the
forehead’s
wrinkles
you
seem
to
track
the
antlered
thoughts
descending
there
to
drink
as
the
highland
hunters
track
the
snow
prints
of
the
deer
but
in
the
great
sperm
whale
this
high
and
mighty
god-like
dignity
inherent
in
the
brow
is
so
immensely
amplified
that
gazing
on
it
in
that
full
front
view
you
feel
the
deity
and
the
dread
powers
more
forcibly
than
in
beholding
any
other
object
in
living
nature
for
you
see
no
one
point
precisely
not
one
distinct
feature
is
revealed
no
nose
eyes
ears
or
mouth
no
face
he
has
none
proper
nothing
but
that
one
broad
firmament
of
a
forehead
pleated
with
riddles
dumbly
lowering
with
the
doom
of
boats
and
ships
and
men
nor
in
profile
does
this
wondrous
brow
diminish
though
that
way
viewed
its
grandeur
does
not
domineer
upon
you
so
in
profile
you
plainly
perceive
that
horizontal
semi-crescentic
depression
in
the
forehead’s
middle
which
in
man
is
lavater’s
mark
of
genius
but
how
genius
in
the
sperm
whale
has
the
sperm
whale
ever
written
a
book
spoken
a
speech
no
his
great
genius
is
declared
in
his
doing
nothing
particular
to
prove
it
it
is
moreover
declared
in
his
pyramidical
silence
and
this
reminds
me
that
had
the
great
sperm
whale
been
known
to
the
young
orient
world
he
would
have
been
deified
by
their
child-magian
thoughts
they
deified
the
crocodile
of
the
nile
because
the
crocodile
is
tongueless
and
the
sperm
whale
has
no
tongue
or
at
least
it
is
so
exceedingly
small
as
to
be

deny

of

their

that

indeed
place
this

scaled
down
to
the
human
magnitude
among
a
plate
of
men’s
skulls
and
you
would
involuntarily
confound
it
with
them
and
remarking
the
depressions
on
one
part
of
its
summit
in
phrenological
phrase
you
would
say—this
man
had
no
self-esteem

no
veneration
and
by
those
negations
considered
along
with
the
affirmative
fact
of
his
prodigious
bulk
and
power
you
can
best
form
to
yourself
the
truest
though
not
the
most
exhilarating
conception
of
what
the
most
exalted
potency
is
but
if
from
the
comparative
dimensions
of
the
whale’s
proper
brain
you
deem
it
incapable
of
being
adequately
charted
then
i
have
another
idea
for
you
if
you
attentively
regard
almost
any
quadruped’s
spine
you
will
be
struck
with
the
resemblance
of
its
vertebræ
to
a
strung
necklace
of
dwarfed
skulls
all
bearing
rudimental
resemblance
to
the
skull
proper
it
is
a
german
conceit
that
the
vertebræ
are
absolutely
undeveloped
skulls
but
the
curious
external
resemblance
i
take
it
the
germans
were
not
the
first
men
to
perceive
a
foreign
friend
once
pointed
it
out
to
me
in
the
skeleton
of
a
foe
he
had
slain
and
with
the
vertebræ
of
which
he
was
inlaying
in
a
sort
of
basso-relievo
the
beaked
prow
of
his
canoe
now
i
consider
that
the
phrenologists
have
omitted
an
important
thing
in
not
pushing
their
investigations
from
the
cerebellum
through
the
spinal
canal
for
i
believe
that
much
of
a
man’s
character
will
be
found
betokened
in

would
rather
feel

than
your

you
are
a
thin
joist
of

yet

full
and

rejoice
in

in

audacious
staff
of

apply
this
spinal
branch
of
phrenology
to
the
sperm
whale
his
cranial
cavity
is
continuous
with
the
first
neck-vertebra
and
in
that
vertebra
the
bottom
of
the
spinal
canal
will
measure
ten
inches
across
being
eight
in
height
and
of
a
triangular
figure
with
the
base
downwards
as
it
passes
through
the
remaining
vertebræ
the

in
size
but
for
a
considerable
distance
remains
of
large
capacity
now
of
course
this
canal
is
filled
with
much
the
same
strangely
fibrous
substance—the
spinal
cord—as
the
brain
and
directly
communicates
with
the
brain
and
what
is
still
more
for
many
feet
after
emerging
from
the
brain’s
cavity
the
spinal
cord
remains
of
an
undecreasing
girth
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
brain
under
all
these
circumstances
would
it
be
unreasonable
to
survey
and
map
out
the
whale’s
spine
phrenologically
for
viewed
in
this
light
the
wonderful
comparative
smallness
of
his
brain
proper
is
more
than
compensated
by
the
wonderful
comparative
magnitude
of
his
spinal
cord
but
leaving
this
hint
to
operate
as
it
may
with
the
phrenologists
i
would
merely
assume
the
spinal
theory
for
a
moment
in
reference
to
the
sperm
whale’s
hump
this
august
hump
if
i
mistake
not
rises
over
one
of
the
larger
vertebræ
and
is
therefore
in
some
sort
the
outer
convex
mould
of
it
from
its
relative
situation
then
i
should
call
this
high
hump
the
organ
of
firmness
or
indomitableness
in
the
sperm
whale
and
that
the
great
monster
is
indomitable

“what

concluding
by
hinting
that

was
indeed
what
in

is
technically
called
a
_clean_
one
that
is
an
empty
one
well
deserving

he
had
not
gained
his

side
when
whales
were
almost
simultaneously
raised
from
the
mast-heads
of
both
vessels
and
so
eager
for
the
chase
was
derick
that
without
pausing
to
put
his
oil-can
and
lamp-feeder
aboard
he
slewed
round
his
boat
and
made
after
the
leviathan
lamp-feeders
now
the
game
having
risen
to
leeward
he
and
the
other
three
german
boats
that
soon
followed
him
had
considerably
the
start
of
the
pequod’s
keels
there
were
eight
whales
an
average
pod
aware
of
their
danger
they
were
going
all
abreast
with
great
speed
straight
before
the
wind
rubbing
their
flanks
as
closely
as
so
many
spans
of
horses
in
harness
they
left
a
great
wide
wake
as
though
continually
unrolling
a
great
wide
parchment
upon
the
sea
full
in
this
rapid
wake
and
many
fathoms
in
the
rear
swam
a
huge
humped
old
bull
which
by
his
comparatively
slow
progress
as
well
as
by
the
unusual
yellowish
incrustations
overgrowing
him
seemed
afflicted
with
the
jaundice
or
some
other
infirmity
whether
this
whale
belonged
to
the
pod
in
advance
seemed
questionable
for
it
is
not
customary
for
such
venerable
leviathans
to
be
at
all
social
nevertheless
he
stuck
to
their
wake
though
indeed
their
back
water
must
have
retarded
him
because
the
white-bone
or
swell
at
his
broad
muzzle
was
a
dashed
one
like
the
swell
formed
when
two
hostile
currents
meet
his
spout
was
short
slow
and
laborious
coming
forth
with
a
choking
sort
of
gush
and
spending
itself
in
torn
shreds
followed
by
strange
subterranean
commotions
in
him
which
seemed
to
have
egress
at
his
other
buried
extremity
causing
the
waters
behind
him
to
upbubble
“who’s
got
some
paregoric?”
said

as
an
overladen
indiaman
bearing
down
the
hindostan
coast
with
a
deck
load
of
frightened
horses
careens
buries
rolls
and
wallows
on
her
way
so
did
this
old
whale
heave
his
aged
bulk
and
now
and
then
partly
turning
over
on
his
cumbrous
rib-ends
expose
the
cause
of
his
devious
wake
in
the
unnatural
stump
of
his
starboard
fin
whether
he
had
lost
that
fin
in

had
been
born

it

near
him
“mind

cried

“give

him.”
with
one
intent
all
the
combined
rival
boats
were
pointed
for
this
one
fish
because
not
only
was
he
the
largest
and
therefore
the
most
valuable
whale
but
he
was
nearest
to
them
and
the
other
whales
were
going
with
such
great
velocity
moreover
as
almost
to
defy
pursuit
for
the
time
at
this
juncture
the
pequod’s
keels
had
shot
by
the
three
german
boats
last
lowered
but
from
the
great
start
he
had
had
derick’s
boat
still
led
the
chase
though
every
moment
neared
by
his
foreign
rivals
the
only
thing
they
feared
was
that
from
being
already
so
nigh
to
his
mark
he
would
be
enabled
to
dart
his
iron
before
they
could
completely
overtake
and
pass
him
as
for
derick
he
seemed
quite
confident
that
this
would
be
the
case
and
occasionally
with
a
deriding
gesture
shook
his
lamp-feeder
at
the
other
boats
“the
ungracious
and
ungrateful
dog!”
cried
starbuck
“he
mocks
and
dares
me
with

in
his
old
intense
whisper—“give

“i

stubb
to
his
crew—“it’s

dancing
up
and
down—“what

at
this
moment
derick
was
in
the
act
of
pitching
his
lamp-feeder
at
the
advancing
boats
and
also
his
oil-can
perhaps
with
the
double
view
of
retarding
his
rivals’
way
and
at
the
same
time
economically
accelerating
his
own
by
the
momentary
impetus
of
the
backward
toss
“the
unmannerly
dutch
dogger!”
cried
stubb
“pull

disposed

him

attitude

when
drawing
near
to
his
prey
the
three
mates
stood
up
proudly
occasionally
backing
the

an
exhilarating
cry
of
“there

slides

that

of
all
their
gallantry
he
would
have
proved
the
victor

race
had
not
a
righteous
judgment
descended
upon
him
in
a
crab
which
caught
the
blade
of
his
midship
oarsman
while
this
clumsy
lubber
was
striving
to
free
his
white-ash
and
while
in
consequence

was
nigh
to

thundering
away
at

rage;—that

and

with
a
shout

took
a
mortal
start
forwards
and
slantingly
ranged
up
on
the
german’s
quarter
an
instant
more
and
all
four
boats
were
diagonically
in
the
whale’s
immediate
wake
while
stretching
from
them
on
both
sides
was
the
foaming
swell
that
he
made

was

terrific
most
pitiable
and
maddening
sight

was
now
going
head
out
and
sending
his
spout
before
him
in

continual
tormented
jet
while

poor
fin
beat
his
side
in
an
agony
of
fright
now
to
this
hand
now
to
that
he
yawed
in
his
faltering
flight
and
still
at
every
billow
that
he
broke
he
spasmodically
sank
in
the
sea
or
sideways
rolled
towards
the
sky
his
one
beating
fin
so
have
i
seen
a
bird
with
clipped
wing
making
affrighted
broken
circles
in
the
air
vainly
striving
to
escape
the
piratical
hawks
but
the
bird
has
a
voice
and
with
plaintive
cries
will
make
known
her
fear
but
the
fear
of
this
vast
dumb
brute
of
the
sea
was
chained
up
and
enchanted
in
him
he
had
no
voice
save
that
choking
respiration
through
his
spiracle
and
this
made
the
sight
of
him
unspeakably
pitiable
while
still
in
his
amazing
bulk
portcullis
jaw
and
omnipotent
tail
there
was
enough
to
appal
the
stoutest
man
who
so
pitied
seeing
now
that
but
a
very
few
moments
more
would
give
the
pequod’s
boats
the
advantage
and
rather
than
be
thus
foiled
of
his
game
derick
chose
to
hazard
what
to
him
must
have
seemed
a
most
unusually
long
dart
ere
the
last
chance
would
for
ever
escape
but
no
sooner
did
his
harpooneer
stand
up
for
the
stroke
than
all
three
tigers—queequeg
tashtego
daggoo—instinctively
sprang
to
their
feet
and
standing
in
a
diagonal
row
simultaneously
pointed
their
barbs
and
darted
over
the
head
of
the
german
harpooneer
their
three
nantucket
irons
entered
the
whale
blinding
vapors
of
foam
and
white-fire
the
three
boats
in
the
first
fury
of
the
whale’s
headlong
rush
bumped
the
german’s
aside
with
such
force
that
both
derick
and
his
baffled
harpooneer
were
spilled
out
and
sailed
over
by
the
three
flying
keels
“don’t
be
afraid
my
butter-boxes,”
cried
stubb
casting
a
passing
glance
upon
them
as
he
shot
by
“ye’ll
be
picked
up
presently—all
right—i
saw
some
sharks
astern—st
bernard’s
dogs
you
know—relieve
distressed
travellers
hurrah
this
is
the
way
to
sail
now
every
keel
a
sunbeam
hurrah!—here
we
go
like
three
tin
kettles
at
the
tail
of
a
mad
cougar
this
puts
me
in
mind
of
fastening
to
an
elephant
in
a
tilbury
on
a
plain—makes
the
wheel-spokes
fly
boys
when
you
fasten
to
him
that
way
and
there’s
danger
of
being
pitched
out
too
when
you
strike
a
hill
hurrah
this
is
the
way
a
fellow
feels
when
he’s
going
to
davy
jones—all
a
rush
down
an
endless
inclined
plane
hurrah
this
whale
carries
the
everlasting
mail!”
but
the
monster’s
run
was
a
brief
one
giving
a
sudden
gasp
he
tumultuously
sounded
with
a
grating
rush
the
three
lines
flew
round
the
loggerheads
with
such
a
force
as
to
gouge
deep
grooves
in
them
while
so
fearful
were
the
harpooneers
that
this
rapid
sounding
would
soon
exhaust
the
lines
that
using
all
their
dexterous
might
they
caught
repeated
smoking
turns
with
the
rope
to
hold
on
till
at
last—owing
to
the
perpendicular
strain
from
the
lead-lined
chocks
of
the
boats
whence
the
three
ropes
went
straight
down
into
the
blue—the
gunwales
of
the
bows
were
almost
even
with
the
water
while
the
three
sterns
tilted
high
in
the
air
and
the
whale
soon
ceasing
to
sound
for
some
time
they
remained
in
that
attitude
fearful
of
expending
more
line
though
the
position
was
a
little
ticklish
but
though
boats
have
been
taken
down
and
lost
in
this
way
yet
it
is
this
“holding
on,”
as
it
is
called
this
hooking
up
by
the
sharp
barbs
of
his
live
flesh
from
the
back
this
it
is
that
often
torments
the
leviathan
into
soon
rising
again
to
meet
the
sharp
lance
of
his
foes
yet
not
to
speak
of
the
peril
of
the
thing
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
this
course
is
always
the
best
for
it
is
but
reasonable
to
presume
that
the
longer
the
stricken
whale
stays
under
water
the
more
he
is
exhausted
because
owing
to
the
enormous
surface
of
him—in
a
full
grown
sperm
whale
something
less
than
2000
square
feet—the
pressure
of
the
water
is
immense
we
all
know
what
an
astonishing
atmospheric
weight
we
ourselves
stand
up
under
even
here
above-ground
in
the
air
how
vast
then
the
burden
of
a
whale
bearing
on
his
back
a
column
of
two
hundred
fathoms
of
ocean
it
must
at
least
equal
the
weight
of
fifty
atmospheres
one
whaleman
has
estimated
it
at
the
weight
of
twenty
line-of-battle
ships
with
all
their
guns
and
stores
and
men
on
board
as
the
three
boats
lay
there
on
that
gently
rolling
sea
gazing
down
into
its
eternal
blue
noon
and
as
not
a
single
groan
or
cry
of
any
sort
nay
not
so
much
as
a
ripple
or
a
bubble
came
up
from
its
depths
what
landsman
would
have
thought
that
beneath
all
that
silence
and
placidity
the
utmost
monster
of
the
seas
was
writhing
and
wrenching
in
agony
not
eight
inches
of
perpendicular
rope
were
visible
at
the
bows
seems
it
credible
that
by
three
such
thin
threads
the
great
leviathan
was
suspended
like
the
big
weight
to
an
eight
day
clock
suspended
and
to
what
to
three
bits
of
board
is
this
the
creature
of
whom
it
was
once
so
triumphantly
said—“canst
thou
fill
his
skin
with
barbed
irons
or
his
head
with
fish-spears
the
sword
of
him
that
layeth
at
him
cannot
hold
the
spear
the
dart
nor
the
habergeon
he
esteemeth
iron
as
straw
the
arrow
cannot
make
him
flee
darts
are
counted
as
stubble
he
laugheth
at
the
shaking
of
a
spear!”
this
the
creature
this
he
oh
that
unfulfilments
should
follow
the
prophets
for
with
the
strength
of
a
thousand
thighs
in
his
tail
leviathan
had
run
his
head
under
the
mountains
of
the
sea
to
hide
him
from
the
pequod’s
fish-spears
in
that
sloping
afternoon
sunlight
the
shadows
that
the
three
boats
sent
down
beneath
the
surface
must
have
been
long
enough
and
broad
enough
to
shade
half
xerxes’
army
who
can
tell
how
appalling
to
the
wounded
whale
must
have
been
such
huge
phantoms
flitting
over
his
head
“stand
by
men
he
stirs,”
cried
starbuck
as
the
three
lines
suddenly
vibrated
in
the
water
distinctly
conducting
upwards
to
them
as
by
magnetic
wires
the
life
and
death
throbs
of
the
whale
so
that
every
oarsman
felt
them
in
his
seat
the
next
moment
relieved
in
great
part
from
the
downward
strain
at
the
bows
the
boats
gave
a
sudden
bounce
upwards
as
a
small
icefield
will
when
a
dense
herd
of
white
bears
are
scared
from
it
into
the
sea
“haul
in
haul
in!”
cried
starbuck
again
“he’s
rising.”
the
lines
of
which
hardly
an
instant
before
not
one
hand’s
breadth
could
have
been
gained
were
now
in
long
quick
coils
flung
back
all
dripping
into
the
boats
and
soon
the
whale
broke
water
within
two
ship’s
lengths
of
the
hunters
his
motions
plainly
denoted
his
extreme
exhaustion
in
most
land
animals
there
are
certain
valves
or
flood-gates
in
many
of
their
veins
whereby
when
wounded
the
blood
is
in
some
degree
at
least
instantly
shut
off
in
certain
directions
not
so
with
the
whale
one
of
whose
peculiarities
it
is
to
have
an
entire
non-valvular
structure
of
the
blood-vessels
so
that
when
pierced
even
by
so
small
a
point
as
a
harpoon
a
deadly
drain
is
at
once
begun
upon
his
whole
arterial
system
and
when
this
is
heightened
by
the
extraordinary
pressure
of
water
at
a
great
distance
below
the
surface
his
life
may
be
said
to
pour
from
him
in
incessant
streams
yet
so
vast
is
the
quantity
of
blood
in
him
and
so
distant
and
numerous
its
interior
fountains
that
he
will
keep
thus
bleeding
and
bleeding
for
a
considerable
period
even
as
in
a
drought
a
river
will
flow
whose
source
is
in
the
well-springs
of
far-off
and
undiscernible
hills
even
now
when
the
boats
pulled
upon
this
whale
and
perilously
drew
over
his
swaying
flukes
and
the
lances
were
darted
into
him
they
were
followed
by
steady
jets
from
the
new
made
wound
which
kept
continually
playing
while
the
natural
spout-hole
in
his
head
was
only
at
intervals
however
rapid
sending
its
affrighted
moisture
into
the
air
from
this
last
vent
no
blood
yet
came
because
no
vital
part
of
him
had
thus
far
been
struck
his
life
as
they
significantly
call
it
was
untouched
as
the
boats
now
more
closely
surrounded
him
the
whole
upper
part
of
his
form
with
much
of
it
that
is
ordinarily
submerged
was
plainly
revealed
his
eyes
or
rather
the
places
where
his
eyes
had
been
were
beheld
as
strange
misgrown
masses
gather
in
the
knot-holes
of
the
noblest
oaks
when
prostrate
so
from
the
points
which
the
whale’s
eyes
had
once
occupied
now
protruded
blind
bulbs
horribly
pitiable
to
see
but
pity
there
was
none
for
all
his
old
age
and
his
one
arm
and
his
blind
eyes
he
must
die
the
death
and
be
murdered
in
order
to
light
the
gay
bridals
and
other
merry-makings
of
men
and
also
to
illuminate
the
solemn
churches
that
preach
unconditional
inoffensiveness
by
all
to
all
still
rolling
in
his
blood
at
last
he
partially
disclosed
a
strangely
discoloured
bunch
or
protuberance
the
size
of
a
bushel
low
down
on
the
flank
“a
nice
spot,”
cried
flask
“just
let
me
prick
him
there
once.”
“avast!”
cried
starbuck
“there’s
no
need
of
that!”
but
humane
starbuck
was
too
late
at
the
instant
of
the
dart
an
ulcerous
jet
shot
from
this
cruel
wound
and
goaded
by
it
into
more
than
sufferable
anguish
the
whale
now
spouting
thick
blood
with
swift
fury
blindly
darted
at
the
craft
bespattering
them
and
their
glorying
crews
all
over
with
showers
of
gore
capsizing
flask’s
boat
and
marring
the
bows
it
was
his
death
stroke
for
by
this
time
so
spent
was
he
by
loss
of
blood
that
he
helplessly
rolled
away
from
the
wreck
he
had
made
lay
panting
on
his
side
impotently
flapped
with
his
stumped
fin
then
over
and
over
slowly
revolved
like
a
waning
world
turned
up
the
white
secrets
of
his
belly
lay
like
a
log
and
died
it
was
most
piteous
that
last
expiring
spout
as
when
by
unseen
hands
the
water
is
gradually
drawn
off
from
some
mighty
fountain
and
with
half-stifled
melancholy
gurglings
the
spray-column
lowers
and
lowers
to
the
ground—so
the
last
long
dying
spout
of
the
whale
soon
while
the
crews
were
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
ship
the
body
showed
symptoms
of
sinking
with
all
its
treasures
unrifled
immediately
by
starbuck’s
orders
lines
were
secured
to
it
at
different
points
so
that
ere
long
every
boat
was
a
buoy
the
sunken
whale
being
suspended
a
few
inches
beneath
them
by
the
cords
by
very
heedful
management
when
the
ship
drew
nigh
the
whale
was
transferred
to
her
side
and
was
strongly
secured
there
by
the
stiffest
fluke-chains
for
it
was
plain
that
unless
artificially
upheld
the
body
would
at
once
sink
to
the
bottom
it
so
chanced
that
almost
upon
first
cutting
into
him
with
the
spade
the
entire
length
of
a
corroded
harpoon
was
found
imbedded
in
his
flesh
on
the
lower
part
of
the
bunch
before
described
but
as
the
stumps
of
harpoons
are
frequently
found
in
the
dead
bodies
of
captured
whales
with
the
flesh
perfectly
healed
around
them
and
no
prominence
of
any
kind
to
denote
their
place
therefore
there
must
needs
have
been
some
other
unknown
reason
in
the
present
case
fully
to
account
for
the
ulceration
alluded
to
but
still
more
curious
was
the
fact
of
a
lance-head
of
stone
being
found
in
him
not
far
from
the
buried
iron
the
flesh
perfectly
firm
about
it
who
had
darted
that
stone
lance
and
when
it
might
have
been
darted
by
some
nor’
west
indian
long
before
america
was
discovered
what
other
marvels
might
have
been
rummaged
out
of
this
monstrous
cabinet
there
is
no
telling
but
a
sudden
stop
was
put
to
further
discoveries
by
the
ship’s
being
unprecedentedly
dragged
over
sideways
to
the
sea
owing
to
the
body’s
immensely
increasing
tendency
to
sink
however
starbuck
who
had
the
ordering
of
affairs
hung
on
to
it
to
the
last
hung
on
to
it
so
resolutely
indeed
that
when
at
length
the
ship
would
have
been
capsized
if
still
persisting
in
locking
arms
with
the
body
then
when
the
command
was
given
to
break
clear
from
it
such
was
the
immovable
strain
upon
the
timber-heads
to
which
the
fluke-chains
and
cables
were
fastened
that
it
was
impossible
to
cast
them
off
meantime
everything
in
the
pequod
was
aslant
to
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
deck
was
like
walking
up
the
steep
gabled
roof
of
a
house
the
ship
groaned
and
gasped
many
of
the
ivory
inlayings
of
her
bulwarks
and
cabins
were
started
from
their
places
by
the
unnatural
dislocation
in
vain
handspikes
and
crows
were
brought
to
bear
upon
the
immovable
fluke-chains
to
pry
them
adrift
from
the
timberheads
and
so
low
had
the
whale
now
settled
that
the
submerged
ends
could
not
be
at
all
approached
while
every
moment
whole
tons
of
ponderosity
seemed
added
to
the
sinking
bulk
and
the
ship
seemed
on
the
point
of
going
over
“hold
on
hold
on
won’t
ye?”
cried
stubb
to
the
body
“don’t
be
in
such
a
devil
of
a
hurry
to
sink
by
thunder
men
we
must
do
something
or
go
for
it
no
use
prying
there
avast
i
say
with
your
handspikes
and
run
one
of
ye
for
a
prayer
book
and
a
pen-knife
and
cut
the
big
chains.”
“knife
aye
aye,”
cried
queequeg
and
seizing
the
carpenter’s
heavy
hatchet
he
leaned
out
of
a
porthole
and
steel
to
iron
began
slashing
at
the
largest
fluke-chains
but
a
few
strokes
full
of
sparks
were
given
when
the
exceeding
strain
effected
the
rest
with
a
terrific
snap
every
fastening
went
adrift
the
ship
righted
the
carcase
sank
now
this
occasional
inevitable
sinking
of
the
recently
killed
sperm
whale
is
a
very
curious
thing
nor
has
any
fisherman
yet
adequately
accounted
for
it
usually
the
dead
sperm
whale
floats
with
great
buoyancy
with
its
side
or
belly
considerably
elevated
above
the
surface
if
the
only
whales
that
thus
sank
were
old
meagre
and
broken-hearted
creatures
their
pads
of
lard
diminished
and
all
their
bones
heavy
and
rheumatic
then
you
might
with
some
reason
assert
that
this
sinking
is
caused
by
an
uncommon
specific
gravity
in
the
fish
so
sinking
consequent
upon
this
absence
of
buoyant
matter
in
him
but
it
is
not
so
for
young
whales
in
the
highest
health
and
swelling
with
noble
aspirations
prematurely
cut
off
in
the
warm
flush
and
may
of
life
with
all
their
panting
lard
about
them
even
these
brawny
buoyant
heroes
do
sometimes
sink
be
it
said
however
that
the
sperm
whale
is
far
less
liable
to
this
accident
than
any
other
species
where
one
of
that
sort
go
down
twenty
right
whales
do
this
difference
in
the
species
is
no
doubt
imputable
in
no
small
degree
to
the
greater
quantity
of
bone
in
the
right
whale
his
venetian
blinds
alone
sometimes
weighing
more
than
a
ton
from
this
incumbrance
the
sperm
whale
is
wholly
free
but
there
are
instances
where
after
the
lapse
of
many
hours
or
several
days
the
sunken
whale
again
rises
more
buoyant
than
in
life
but
the
reason
of
this
is
obvious
gases
are
generated
in
him
he
swells
to
a
prodigious
magnitude
becomes
a
sort
of
animal
balloon
a
line-of-battle
ship
could
hardly
keep
him
under
then
in
the
shore
whaling
on
soundings
among
the
bays
of
new
zealand
when
a
right
whale
gives
token
of
sinking
they
fasten
buoys
to
him
with
plenty
of
rope
so
that
when
the
body
has
gone
down
they
know
where
to
look
for
it
when
it
shall
have
ascended
again
it
was
not
long
after
the
sinking
of
the
body
that
a
cry
was
heard
from
the
pequod’s
mast-heads
announcing
that
the
jungfrau
was
again
lowering
her
boats
though
the
only
spout
in
sight
was
that
of
a
fin-back
belonging
to
the
species
of
uncapturable
whales
because
of
its
incredible
power
of
swimming
nevertheless
the
fin-back’s
spout
is
so
similar
to
the
sperm
whale’s
that
by
unskilful
fishermen
it
is
often
mistaken
for
it
and
consequently
derick
and
all
his
host
were
now
in
valiant
chase
of
this
unnearable
brute
the
virgin
crowding
all
sail
made
after
her
four
young
keels
and
thus
they
all
disappeared
far
to
leeward
still
in
bold
hopeful
chase
oh
many
are
the
fin-backs
and
many
are

dericks

the
honor
and
glory
of
whaling
there
are
some
enterprises
in
which
a
careful
disorderliness
is
the
true
method
the
more
i
dive
into
this
matter
of
whaling
and
push
my
researches
up
to
the
very
spring-head
of
it
so
much
the
more
am
i
impressed
with
its
great
honorableness
and
antiquity
and
especially
when
i
find
so
many
great
demi-gods
and
heroes
prophets
of
all
sorts
who
one
way
or
other
have
shed
distinction
upon
it
i
am
transported
with
the
reflection
that
i
myself
belong
though
but
subordinately
to
so
emblazoned
a
fraternity
the
gallant
perseus
a
son
of
jupiter
was
the
first
whaleman
and
to
the
eternal
honor
of
our
calling
be
it
said
that
the
first
whale
attacked
by
our
brotherhood
was
not
killed
with
any
sordid
intent
those
were
the
knightly
days
of
our
profession
when
we
only
bore
arms
to
succor
the
distressed
and
not
to
fill
men’s
lamp-feeders
every
one
knows
the
fine
story
of
perseus
and
andromeda
how
the
lovely
andromeda
the
daughter
of
a
king
was
tied
to
a
rock
on
the
sea-coast
and
as
leviathan
was
in
the
very
act
of
carrying
her
off
perseus
the
prince
of
whalemen
intrepidly
advancing
harpooned
the
monster
and
delivered
and
married
the
maid
it
was
an
admirable
artistic
exploit
rarely
achieved
by
the
best
harpooneers
of
the
present
day
inasmuch
as
this
leviathan
was
slain
at
the
very
first
dart
and
let
no
man
doubt
this
arkite
story
for
in
the
ancient
joppa
now
jaffa
on
the
syrian
coast
in
one
of
the
pagan
temples
there
stood
for
many
ages
the
vast
skeleton
of
a
whale
which
the
city’s
legends
and
all
the
inhabitants
asserted
to
be
the
identical
bones
of
the
monster
that
perseus
slew
when
the
romans
took
joppa
the
same
skeleton
was
carried
to
italy
in
triumph
what
seems
most
singular
and
suggestively
important
in
this
story
is
this
it
was
from
joppa
that
jonah
set
sail
akin
to
the
adventure
of
perseus
and
andromeda—indeed
by
some
supposed
to
be
indirectly
derived
from
it—is
that
famous
story
of
st
george
and
the
dragon
which
dragon
i
maintain
to
have
been
a
whale
for
in
many
old
chronicles
whales
and
dragons
are
strangely
jumbled
together
and
often
stand
for
each
other
“thou
art
as
a
lion
of
the
waters
and
as
a
dragon
of
the
sea,”
saith
ezekiel
hereby
plainly
meaning
a
whale
in
truth
some
versions
of
the
bible
use
that
word
itself
besides
it
would
much
subtract
from
the
glory
of
the
exploit
had
st
george
but
encountered
a
crawling
reptile
of
the
land
instead
of
doing
battle
with
the
great
monster
of
the
deep
any
man
may
kill
a
snake
but
only
a
perseus
a
st
george
a
coffin
have
the
heart
in
them
to
march
boldly
up
to
a
whale
let
not
the
modern
paintings
of
this
scene
mislead
us
for
though
the
creature
encountered
by
that
valiant
whaleman
of
old
is
vaguely
represented
of
a
griffin-like
shape
and
though
the
battle
is
depicted
on
land
and
the
saint
on
horseback
yet
considering
the
great
ignorance
of
those
times
when
the
true
form
of
the
whale
was
unknown
to
artists
and
considering
that
as
in
perseus’
case
st
george’s
whale
might
have
crawled
up
out
of
the
sea
on
the
beach
and
considering
that
the
animal
ridden
by
st
george
might
have
been
only
a
large
seal
or
sea-horse
bearing
all
this
in
mind
it
will
not
appear
altogether
incompatible
with
the
sacred
legend
and
the
ancientest
draughts
of
the
scene
to
hold
this
so-called
dragon
no
other
than
the
great
leviathan
himself
in
fact
placed
before
the
strict
and
piercing
truth
this
whole
story
will
fare
like
that
fish
flesh
and
fowl
idol
of
the
philistines
dagon
by
name
who
being
planted
before
the
ark
of
israel
his
horse’s
head
and
both
the
palms
of
his
hands
fell
off
from
him
and
only
the
stump
or
fishy
part
of
him
remained
thus
then
one
of
our
own
noble
stamp
even
a
whaleman
is
the
tutelary
guardian
of
england
and
by
good
rights
we
harpooneers
of
nantucket
should
be
enrolled
in
the
most
noble
order
of
st
george
and
therefore
let
not
the
knights
of
that
honorable
company
none
of
whom
i
venture
to
say
have
ever
had
to
do
with
a
whale
like
their
great
patron
let
them
never
eye
a
nantucketer
with
disdain
since
even
in
our
woollen
frocks
and
tarred
trowsers
we
are
much
better
entitled
to
st
george’s
decoration
than
they
whether
to
admit
hercules
among
us
or
not
concerning
this
i
long
remained
dubious
for
though
according
to
the
greek
mythologies
that
antique
crockett
and
kit
carson—that
brawny
doer
of
rejoicing
good
deeds
was
swallowed
down
and
thrown
up
by
a
whale
still
whether
that
strictly
makes
a
whaleman
of
him
that
might
be
mooted
it
nowhere
appears
that
he
ever
actually
harpooned
his
fish
unless
indeed
from
the
inside
nevertheless
he
may
be
deemed
a
sort
of
involuntary
whaleman
at
any
rate
the
whale
caught
him
if
he
did
not
the
whale
i
claim
him
for
one
of
our
clan
but
by
the
best
contradictory
authorities
this
grecian
story
of
hercules
and
the
whale
is
considered
to
be
derived
from
the
still
more
ancient
hebrew
story
of
jonah
and
the
whale
and
vice
versâ
certainly
they
are
very
similar
if
i
claim
the
demi-god
then
why
not
the
prophet
nor
do
heroes
saints
demigods
and
prophets
alone
comprise
the
whole
roll
of
our
order
our
grand
master
is
still
to
be
named
for
like
royal
kings
of
old
times
we
find
the
head
waters
of
our
fraternity
in
nothing
short
of
the
great
gods
themselves
that
wondrous
oriental
story
is
now
to
be
rehearsed
from
the
shaster
which
gives
us
the
dread
vishnoo
one
of
the
three
persons
in
the
godhead
of
the
hindoos
gives
us
this
divine
vishnoo
himself
for
our
lord;—vishnoo
who
by
the
first
of
his
ten
earthly
incarnations
has
for
ever
set
apart
and
sanctified
the
whale
when
brahma
or
the
god
of
gods
saith
the
shaster
resolved
to
recreate
the
world
after
one
of
its
periodical
dissolutions
he
gave
birth
to
vishnoo
to
preside
over
the
work
but
the
vedas
or
mystical
books
whose
perusal
would
seem
to
have
been
indispensable
to
vishnoo
before
beginning
the
creation
and
which
therefore
must
have
contained
something
in
the
shape
of
practical
hints
to
young
architects
these
vedas
were
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
waters
so
vishnoo
became
incarnate
in
a
whale
and
sounding
down
in
him
to
the
uttermost
depths
rescued
the
sacred
volumes
was
not
this
vishnoo
a
whaleman
then
even
as
a
man
who
rides
a
horse
is
called
a
horseman
perseus
st
george
hercules
jonah
and
vishnoo
there’s
a
member-roll
for
you
what
club
but
the
whaleman’s
can
head
off
like
that
chapter
83
jonah
historically
regarded
reference
was
made
to
the
historical
story
of
jonah
and
the
whale
in
the
preceding
chapter
now
some
nantucketers
rather
distrust
this
historical
story
of
jonah
and
the
whale
but
then
there
were
some
sceptical
greeks
and
romans
who
standing
out
from
the
orthodox
pagans
of
their
times
equally
doubted
the
story
of
hercules
and
the
whale
and
arion
and
the
dolphin
and
yet
their
doubting
those
traditions
did
not
make
those
traditions
one
whit
the
less
facts
for
all
that
one
old
sag-harbor
whaleman’s
chief
reason
for
questioning
the
hebrew
story
was
this:—he
had
one
of
those
quaint
old-fashioned
bibles
embellished
with
curious
unscientific
plates
one
of
which
represented
jonah’s
whale
with
two
spouts
in
his
head—a
peculiarity
only
true
with
respect
to
a
species
of
the
leviathan
the
right
whale
and
the
varieties
of
that
order
concerning
which
the
fishermen
have
this
saying
“a
penny
roll
would
choke
him”
his
swallow
is
so
very
small
but
to
this
bishop
jebb’s
anticipative
answer
is
ready
it
is
not
necessary
hints
the
bishop
that
we
consider
jonah
as
tombed
in
the
whale’s
belly
but
as
temporarily
lodged
in
some
part
of
his
mouth
and
this
seems
reasonable
enough
in
the
good
bishop
for
truly
the
right
whale’s
mouth
would
accommodate
a
couple
of
whist-tables
and
comfortably
seat
all
the
players
possibly
too
jonah
might
have
ensconced
himself
in
a
hollow
tooth
but
on
second
thoughts
the
right
whale
is
toothless
another
reason
which
sag-harbor
he
went
by
that
name
urged
for
his
want
of
faith
in
this
matter
of
the
prophet
was
something
obscurely
in
reference
to
his
incarcerated
body
and
the
whale’s
gastric
juices
but
this
objection
likewise
falls
to
the
ground
because
a
german
exegetist
supposes
that
jonah
must
have
taken
refuge
in
the
floating
body
of
a
_dead_
whale—even
as
the
french
soldiers
in
the
russian
campaign
turned
their
dead
horses
into
tents
and
crawled
into
them
besides
it
has
been
divined
by
other
continental
commentators
that
when
jonah
was
thrown
overboard
from
the
joppa
ship
he
straightway
effected
his
escape
to
another
vessel
near
by
some
vessel
with
a
whale
for
a
figure-head
and
i
would
add
possibly
called
“the
whale,”
as
some
craft
are
nowadays
christened
the
“shark,”
the
“gull,”
the
“eagle.”
nor
have
there
been
wanting
learned
exegetists
who
have
opined
that
the
whale
mentioned
in
the
book
of
jonah
merely
meant
a
life-preserver—an
inflated
bag
of
wind—which
the
endangered
prophet
swam
to
and
so
was
saved
from
a
watery
doom
poor
sag-harbor
therefore
seems
worsted
all
round
but
he
had
still
another
reason
for
his
want
of
faith
it
was
this
if
i
remember
right
jonah
was
swallowed
by
the
whale
in
the
mediterranean
sea
and
after
three
days
he
was
vomited
up
somewhere
within
three
days’
journey
of
nineveh
a
city
on
the
tigris
very
much
more
than
three
days’
journey
across
from
the
nearest
point
of
the
mediterranean
coast
how
is
that
but
was
there
no
other
way
for
the
whale
to
land
the
prophet
within
that
short
distance
of
nineveh
yes
he
might
have
carried
him
round
by
the
way
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
but
not
to
speak
of
the
passage
through
the
whole
length
of
the
mediterranean
and
another
passage
up
the
persian
gulf
and
red
sea
such
a
supposition
would
involve
the
complete
circumnavigation
of
all
africa
in
three
days
not
to
speak
of
the
tigris
waters
near
the
site
of
nineveh
being
too
shallow
for
any
whale
to
swim
in
besides
this
idea
of
jonah’s
weathering
the
cape
of
good
hope
at
so
early
a
day
would
wrest
the
honor
of
the
discovery
of
that
great
headland
from
bartholomew
diaz
its
reputed
discoverer
and
so
make
modern
history
a
liar
but
all
these
foolish
arguments
of
old
sag-harbor
only
evinced
his
foolish
pride
of
reason—a
thing
still
more
reprehensible
in
him
seeing
that
he
had
but
little
learning
except
what
he
had
picked
up
from
the
sun
and
the
sea
i
say
it
only
shows
his
foolish
impious
pride
and
abominable
devilish
rebellion
against
the
reverend
clergy
for
by
a
portuguese
catholic
priest
this
very
idea
of
jonah’s
going
to
nineveh
via
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
advanced
as
a
signal
magnification
of
the
general
miracle
and
so
it
was
besides
to
this
day
the
highly
enlightened
turks
devoutly
believe
in
the
historical
story
of
jonah
and
some
three
centuries
ago
an
english
traveller
in
old
harris’s
voyages
speaks
of
a
turkish
mosque
built
in
honor
of
jonah
in
which
mosque
was
a
miraculous
lamp
that
burnt
without
any
oil

the

and
for
much
the
same
purpose
some
whalers
perform
an
analogous
operation
upon
their
boat
they
grease
the
bottom
nor
is
it
to
be
doubted
that
as
such
a
procedure
can
do
no
harm
it
may
possibly
be
of
no
contemptible
advantage
considering
that
oil
and
water
are
hostile
that
oil
is
a
sliding
thing
and
that
the
object
in
view
is
to
make
the
boat
slide
bravely
queequeg
believed
strongly
in
anointing
his
boat
and
one
morning
not
long
after
the
german
ship
jungfrau
disappeared
took
more
than
customary
pains
in
that
occupation
crawling
under
its
bottom
where
it
hung
over
the
side
and
rubbing
in
the
unctuousness
as
though
diligently
seeking
to
insure
a
crop
of
hair
from
the
craft’s
bald
keel
he
seemed
to
be
working
in
obedience
to
some
particular
presentiment
nor
did
it
remain
unwarranted
by
the
event
towards
noon
whales
were
raised
but
so
soon
as
the
ship
sailed
down
to
them
they
turned
and
fled
with
swift
precipitancy
a
disordered
flight
as
of
cleopatra’s
barges
from
actium
nevertheless
the
boats
pursued
and
stubb’s
was
foremost
by
great
exertion
tashtego
at
last
succeeded
in
planting
one
iron
but
the
stricken
whale
without
at
all
sounding
still
continued
his
horizontal
flight
with
added
fleetness
such
unintermitted
strainings
upon
the
planted
iron
must
sooner
or
later
inevitably
extract
it
it
became
imperative
to
lance
the
flying
whale
or
be
content
to
lose
him
but
to
haul
the
boat
up
to
his
flank
was
impossible
he
swam
so
fast
and
furious
what
then
remained
of
all
the
wondrous
devices
and
dexterities
the
sleights
of
hand
and
countless
subtleties
to
which
the
veteran
whaleman
is
so
often
forced
none
exceed
that
fine
manœuvre
with
the
lance
called
pitchpoling
small
sword
or
broad
sword
in
all
its
exercises
boasts
nothing
like
it
it
is
only
indispensable
with
an
inveterate
running
whale
its
grand
fact
and
feature
is
the
wonderful
distance
to
which
the
long
lance
is
accurately
darted
from
a
violently
rocking
jerking
boat
under
extreme
headway
steel
and
wood
included
the
entire
spear
is
some
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
length
the
staff
is
much
slighter
than
that
of
the
harpoon
and
also
of
a
lighter
material—pine
it
is
furnished
with
a
small
rope
called
a
warp
of
considerable
length
by
which
it
can
be
hauled
back
to
the
hand
after
darting
but
before
going
further
it
is
important
to
mention
here
that
though
the
harpoon
may
be
pitchpoled
in
the
same
way
with
the
lance
yet
it
is
seldom
done
and
when
done
is
still
less
frequently
successful
on
account
of
the
greater
weight
and
inferior
length
of
the
harpoon
as
compared
with
the
lance
which
in
effect
become
serious
drawbacks
as
a
general
thing
therefore
you
must
first
get
fast
to
a
whale
before
any
pitchpoling
comes
into
play
look
now
at
stubb
a
man
who
from
his
humorous
deliberate
coolness
and
equanimity
in
the
direst
emergencies
was
specially
qualified
to
excel
in
pitchpoling
look
at
him
he
stands
upright
in
the
tossed
bow
of
the

the
fountain
that
for
six
thousand
years—and
no
one
knows
how
many
millions
of
ages
before—the
great
whales
should
have
been
spouting
all
over
the
sea
and
sprinkling
and
mistifying
the
gardens
of
the
deep
as
with
so
many
sprinkling
or
mistifying
pots
and
that
for
some
centuries
back
thousands
of
hunters
should
have
been
close
by
the
fountain
of
the
whale
watching
these
sprinklings
and
spoutings—that
all
this
should
be
and
yet
that
down
to
this
blessed
minute
fifteen
and
a
quarter
minutes
past
one
o’clock
p.m
of
this
sixteenth
day
of
december
a.d
1851
it
should
still
remain
a
problem
whether
these
spoutings
are
after
all
really
water
or
nothing
but
vapor—this
is
surely
a
noteworthy
thing
let
us
then
look
at
this
matter
along
with
some
interesting
items
contingent
every
one
knows
that
by
the
peculiar
cunning
of
their
gills
the
finny
tribes
in
general
breathe
the
air
which
at
all
times
is
combined
with
the
element
in
which
they
swim
hence
a
herring
or
a
cod
might
live
a
century
and
never
once
raise
its
head
above
the
surface
but
owing
to
his
marked
internal
structure
which
gives
him
regular
lungs
like
a
human
being’s
the
whale
can
only
live
by
inhaling
the
disengaged
air
in
the
open
atmosphere
wherefore
the
necessity
for
his
periodical
visits
to
the
upper
world
but
he
cannot
in
any
degree
breathe
through
his
mouth
for
in
his
ordinary
attitude
the
sperm
whale’s
mouth
is
buried
at
least
eight
feet
beneath
the
surface
and
what
is
still
more
his
windpipe
has
no
connexion
with
his
mouth
no
he
breathes
through
his
spiracle
alone
and
this
is
on
the
top
of
his
head
if
i
say
that
in
any
creature
breathing
is
only
a
function
indispensable
to
vitality
inasmuch
as
it
withdraws
from
the
air
a
certain
element
which
being
subsequently
brought
into
contact
with
the
blood
imparts
to
the
blood
its
vivifying
principle
i
do
not
think
i
shall
err
though
i
may
possibly
use
some
superfluous
scientific
words
assume
it
and
it
follows
that
if
all
the
blood
in
a
man
could
be
aerated
with
one
breath
he
might
then
seal
up
his
nostrils
and
not
fetch
another
for
a
considerable
time
that
is
to
say
he
would
then
live
without
breathing
anomalous
as
it
may
seem
this
is
precisely
the
case
with
the
whale
who
systematically
lives
by
intervals
his
full
hour
and
more
when
at
the
bottom
without
drawing
a
single
breath
or
so
much
as
in
any
way
inhaling
a
particle
of
air
for
remember
he
has
no
gills
how
is
this
between
his
ribs
and
on
each
side
of
his
spine
he
is
supplied
with
a
remarkable
involved
cretan
labyrinth
of
vermicelli-like
vessels
which
vessels
when
he
quits
the
surface
are
completely
distended
with
oxygenated
blood
so
that
for
an
hour
or
more
a
thousand
fathoms
in
the
sea
he
carries
a
surplus
stock
of
vitality
in
him
just
as
the
camel
crossing
the
waterless
desert
carries
a
surplus
supply
of
drink
for
future
use
in
its
four
supplementary
stomachs
the
anatomical
fact
of
this
labyrinth
is
indisputable
and
that
the
supposition
founded
upon
it
is
reasonable
and
true
seems
the
more
cogent
to
me
when
i
consider
the
otherwise
inexplicable
obstinacy
of
that
leviathan
in
_having
his
spoutings
out_
as
the
fishermen
phrase
it
this
is
what
i
mean
if
unmolested
upon
rising
to
the
surface
the
sperm
whale
will
continue
there
for
a
period
of
time
exactly
uniform
with
all
his
other
unmolested
risings
say
he
stays
eleven
minutes
and
jets
seventy
times
that
is
respires
seventy
breaths
then
whenever
he
rises
again
he
will
be
sure
to
have
his
seventy
breaths
over
again
to
a
minute
now
if
after
he
fetches
a
few
breaths
you
alarm
him
so
that
he
sounds
he
will
be
always
dodging
up
again
to
make
good
his
regular
allowance
of
air
and
not
till
those
seventy
breaths
are
told
will
he
finally
go
down
to
stay
out
his
full
term
below
remark
however
that
in
different
individuals
these
rates
are
different
but
in
any
one
they
are
alike
now
why
should
the
whale
thus
insist
upon
having
his
spoutings
out
unless
it
be
to
replenish
his
reservoir
of
air
ere
descending
for
good
how
obvious
is
it
too
that
this
necessity
for
the
whale’s
rising
exposes
him
to
all
the
fatal
hazards
of
the
chase
for
not
by
hook
or
by
net
could
this
vast
leviathan
be
caught
when
sailing
a
thousand
fathoms
beneath
the
sunlight
not
so
much
thy
skill
then
o
hunter
as
the
great
necessities
that
strike
the
victory
to
thee
in
man
breathing
is
incessantly
going
on—one
breath
only
serving
for
two
or
three
pulsations
so
that
whatever
other
business
he
has
to
attend
to
waking
or
sleeping
breathe
he
must
or
die
he
will
but
the
sperm
whale
only
breathes
about
one
seventh
or
sunday
of
his
time
it
has
been
said
that
the
whale
only
breathes
through
his
spout-hole
if
it
could
truthfully
be
added
that
his
spouts
are
mixed
with
water
then
i
opine
we
should
be
furnished
with
the
reason
why
his
sense
of
smell
seems
obliterated
in
him
for
the
only
thing
about
him
that
at
all
answers
to
his
nose
is
that
identical
spout-hole
and
being
so
clogged
with
two
elements
it
could
not
be
expected
to
have
the
power
of
smelling
but
owing
to
the
mystery
of
the
spout—whether
it
be
water
or
whether
it
be
vapor—no
absolute
certainty
can
as
yet
be
arrived
at
on
this
head
sure
it
is
nevertheless
that
the
sperm
whale
has
no
proper
olfactories
but
what
does
he
want
of
them
no
roses
no
violets
no
cologne-water
in
the
sea
furthermore
as
his
windpipe
solely
opens
into
the
tube
of
his
spouting
canal
and
as
that
long
canal—like
the
grand
erie
canal—is
furnished
with
a
sort
of
locks
that
open
and
shut
for
the
downward
retention
of
air
or
the
upward
exclusion
of
water
therefore
the
whale
has
no
voice
unless
you
insult
him
by
saying
that
when
he
so
strangely
rumbles
he
talks
through
his
nose
but
then
again
what
has
the
whale
to
say
seldom
have
i
known
any
profound
being
that
had
anything
to
say
to
this
world
unless
forced
to
stammer
out
something
by
way
of
getting
a
living
oh
happy
that
the
world
is
such
an
excellent
listener
now
the
spouting
canal
of
the
sperm
whale
chiefly
intended
as
it
is
for
the
conveyance
of
air
and
for
several
feet
laid
along
horizontally
just
beneath
the
upper
surface
of
his
head
and
a
little
to
one
side
this
curious
canal
is
very
much
like
a
gas-pipe
laid
down
in
a
city
on
one
side
of
a
street
but
the
question
returns
whether
this
gas-pipe
is
also
a
water-pipe
in
other
words
whether
the
spout
of
the
sperm
whale
is
the
mere
vapor
of
the
exhaled
breath
or
whether
that
exhaled
breath
is
mixed
with
water
taken
in
at
the
mouth
and
discharged
through
the
spiracle
it
is
certain
that
the
mouth
indirectly
communicates
with
the
spouting
canal
but
it
cannot
be
proved
that
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
discharging
water
through
the
spiracle
because
the
greatest
necessity
for
so
doing
would
seem
to
be
when
in
feeding
he
accidentally
takes
in
water
but
the
sperm
whale’s
food
is
far
beneath
the
surface
and
there
he
cannot
spout
even
if
he
would
besides
if
you
regard
him
very
closely
and
time
him
with
your
watch
you
will
find
that
when
unmolested
there
is
an
undeviating
rhyme
between
the
periods
of
his
jets
and
the
ordinary
periods
of
respiration
but
why
pester
one
with
all
this
reasoning
on
the
subject
speak
out
you
have
seen
him
spout
then
declare
what
the
spout
is
can
you
not
tell
water
from
air
my
dear
sir
in
this
world
it
is
not
so
easy
to
settle
these
plain
things
i
have
ever
found
your
plain
things
the
knottiest
of
all
and
as
for
this
whale
spout
you
might
almost
stand
in
it
and
yet
be
undecided
as
to
what
it
is
precisely
the
central
body
of
it
is
hidden
in
the
snowy
sparkling
mist
enveloping
it
and
how
can
you
certainly
tell
whether
any
water
falls
from
it
when
always
when
you
are
close
enough
to
a
whale
to
get
a
close
view
of
his
spout
he
is
in
a
prodigious
commotion
the
water
cascading
all
around
him
and
if
at
such
times
you
should
think
that
you
really
perceived
drops
of
moisture
in
the
spout
how
do
you
know
that
they
are
not
merely
condensed
from
its
vapor
or
how
do
you
know
that
they
are
not
those
identical
drops
superficially
lodged
in
the
spout-hole
fissure
which
is
countersunk
into
the
summit
of
the
whale’s
head
for
even
when
tranquilly
swimming
through
the
mid-day
sea
in
a
calm
with
his
elevated
hump
sun-dried
as
a
dromedary’s
in
the
desert
even
then
the
whale
always
carries
a
small
basin
of
water
on
his
head
as
under
a
blazing
sun
you
will
sometimes
see
a
cavity
in
a
rock
filled
up
with
rain
nor
is
it
at
all
prudent
for
the
hunter
to
be
over
curious
touching
the
precise
nature
of
the
whale
spout
it
will
not
do
for
him
to
be
peering
into
it
and
putting
his
face
in
it
you
cannot
go
with
your
pitcher
to
this
fountain
and
fill
it
and
bring
it
away
for
even
when
coming
into
slight
contact
with
the
outer
vapory
shreds
of
the
jet
which
will
often
happen
your
skin
will
feverishly
smart
from
the
acridness
of
the
thing
so
touching
it
and
i
know
one
who
coming
into
still
closer
contact
with
the
spout
whether
with
some
scientific
object
in
view
or
otherwise
i
cannot
say
the
skin
peeled
off
from
his
cheek
and
arm
wherefore
among
whalemen
the
spout
is
deemed
poisonous
they
try
to
evade
it
another
thing
i
have
heard
it
said
and
i
do
not
much
doubt
it
that
if
the
jet
is
fairly
spouted
into
your
eyes
it
will
blind
you
the
wisest
thing
the
investigator
can
do
then
it
seems
to
me
is
to
let
this
deadly
spout
alone
still
we
can
hypothesize
even
if
we
cannot
prove
and
establish
my
hypothesis
is
this
that
the
spout
is
nothing
but
mist
and
besides
other
reasons
to
this
conclusion
i
am
impelled
by
considerations
touching
the
great
inherent
dignity
and
sublimity
of
the
sperm
whale
i
account
him
no
common
shallow
being
inasmuch
as
it
is
an
undisputed
fact
that
he
is
never
found
on
soundings
or
near
shores
all
other
whales
sometimes
are
he
is
both
ponderous
and
profound
and
i
am
convinced
that
from
the
heads
of
all
ponderous
profound
beings
such
as
plato
pyrrho
the
devil
jupiter
dante
and
so
on
there
always
goes
up
a
certain
semi-visible
steam
while
in
the
act
of
thinking
deep
thoughts
while
composing
a
little
treatise
on
eternity
i
had
the
curiosity
to
place
a
mirror
before
me
and
ere
long
saw
reflected
there
a
curious
involved
worming
and
undulation
in
the
atmosphere
over
my
head
the
invariable
moisture
of
my
hair
while
plunged
in
deep
thought
after
six
cups
of
hot
tea
in
my
thin
shingled
attic
of
an
august
noon
this
seems
an
additional
argument
for
the
above
supposition
and
how
nobly
it
raises
our
conceit
of
the
mighty
misty
monster
to
behold
him
solemnly
sailing
through
a
calm
tropical
sea
his
vast
mild
head
overhung
by
a
canopy
of
vapor
engendered
by
his
incommunicable
contemplations
and
that
vapor—as
you
will
sometimes
see
it—glorified
by
a
rainbow
as
if
heaven
itself
had
put
its
seal
upon
his
thoughts
for
d’ye
see
rainbows
do
not
visit
the
clear
air
they
only
irradiate
vapor
and
so
through
all
the
thick
mists
of
the
dim
doubts
in
my
mind
divine
intuitions
now
and
then
shoot
enkindling
my
fog
with
a
heavenly
ray
and
for
this
i
thank
god
for
all
have
doubts
many
deny
but
doubts
or
denials
few
along
with
them
have
intuitions
doubts
of
all
things
earthly
and
intuitions
of
some
things
heavenly
this
combination
makes
neither
believer
nor
infidel
but
makes
a
man
who
regards
them
both
with
equal
eye

fifty
square

the

into

long

this
triune
structure

much
as
anything
else
imparts
power
to
the
tail
to
the
student
of

as
if
this
vast
local
power
in
the
tendinous
tail
were
not
enough
the
whole
bulk
of
the
leviathan
is
knit
over
with

warp

muscular
fibres

insensibly
blend
with
them
and
largely
contribute
to
their
might
so
that
in
the
tail
the
confluent
measureless
force
of
the
whole
whale
seems
concentrated
to
a
point
could
annihilation
occur
to
matter
this
were
the
thing
to
do
it
nor
does
this—its
amazing
strength
at
all
tend
to
cripple
the
graceful
flexion
of
its
motions
where
infantileness
of
ease
undulates
through
a
titanism
of
power
on
the
contrary
those
motions
derive
their
most
appalling
beauty
from
it
real
strength
never
impairs
beauty
or
harmony
but
it
often
bestows
it
and
in
everything
imposingly
beautiful
strength
has
much
to
do
with
the
magic
take
away
the
tied
tendons
that
all
over
seem
bursting
from
the
marble
in
the
carved
hercules
and
its
charm
would
be
gone
as
devout
eckerman
lifted
the
linen
sheet
from
the
naked
corpse
of
goethe
he
was
overwhelmed
with
the
massive
chest
of
the
man
that
seemed
as
a
roman
triumphal
arch
when
angelo
paints
even
god
the
father
in
human
form
mark
what
robustness
is
there
and
whatever
they
may
reveal
of
the
divine
love
in
the
son
the
soft
curled
hermaphroditical
italian
pictures
in
which
his
idea
has
been
most
successfully
embodied
these
pictures
so
destitute
as
they
are
of
all
brawniness
hint
nothing
of
any
power
but
the
mere
negative
feminine
one
of
submission
and
endurance
which
on
all
hands
it
is
conceded
form
the
peculiar
practical
virtues
of
his
teachings
such
is
the
subtle
elasticity
of
the
organ
i
treat
of
that
whether
wielded
in
sport
or
in
earnest
or
in
anger
whatever
be
the
mood
it
be
in
its
flexions
are
invariably
marked
by
exceeding
grace
therein
no
fairy’s
arm
can
transcend
it
five
great
motions
are
peculiar
to
it
first
when
used
as
a
fin
for
progression
second
when
used
as
a
mace
in
battle
third
in
sweeping
fourth
in
lobtailing
fifth
in
peaking
flukes
first
being
horizontal
in
its
position
the
leviathan’s
tail
acts
in
a
different
manner
from
the
tails
of
all
other
sea
creatures
it
never
wriggles
in
man
or
fish
wriggling
is
a
sign
of
inferiority
to
the
whale
his
tail
is
the
sole
means
of
propulsion
scroll-wise
coiled
forwards
beneath
the
body
and
then
rapidly
sprung
backwards
it
is
this
which
gives
that
singular
darting
leaping
motion
to
the
monster
when
furiously
swimming
his
side-fins
only
serve
to
steer
by
second
it
is
a
little
significant
that
while
one
sperm
whale
only
fights
another
sperm
whale
with
his
head
and
jaw
nevertheless
in
his
conflicts
with
man
he
chiefly
and
contemptuously
uses
his
tail
in
striking
at
a
boat
he
swiftly
curves
away
his
flukes
from
it
and
the
blow
is
only
inflicted
by
the
recoil
if
it
be
made
in
the
unobstructed
air
especially
if
it
descend
to
its
mark
the
stroke
is
then
simply
irresistible
no
ribs
of
man
or
boat
can
withstand
it
your
only
salvation
lies
in
eluding
it
but
if
it
comes
sideways
through
the
opposing
water
then
partly
owing
to
the
light
buoyancy
of
the
whale-boat
and
the
elasticity
of
its
materials
a
cracked
rib
or
a
dashed
plank
or
two
a
sort
of
stitch
in
the
side
is
generally
the
most
serious
result
these
submerged
side
blows
are
so
often
received
in
the
fishery
that
they
are
accounted
mere
child’s
play
some
one
strips
off
a
frock
and
the
hole
is
stopped
third
i
cannot
demonstrate
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
whale
the
sense
of
touch
is
concentrated
in
the
tail
for
in
this
respect
there
is
a
delicacy
in
it
only
equalled
by
the
daintiness
of
the
elephant’s
trunk
this
delicacy
is
chiefly
evinced
in
the
action
of
sweeping
when
in
maidenly
gentleness
the
whale
with
a
certain
soft
slowness
moves
his
immense
flukes
from
side
to
side
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
if
he
feel
but
a
sailor’s
whisker
woe
to
that
sailor
whiskers
and
all
what
tenderness
there
is
in
that
preliminary
touch
had
this
tail
any
prehensile
power
i
should
straightway
bethink
me
of
darmonodes’
elephant
that
so
frequented
the
flower-market
and
with
low
salutations
presented
nosegays
to
damsels
and
then
caressed
their
zones
on
more
accounts
than
one
a
pity
it
is
that
the
whale
does
not
possess
this
prehensile
virtue
in
his
tail
for
i
have
heard
of
yet
another
elephant
that
when
wounded
in
the
fight
curved
round
his
trunk
and
extracted
the
dart
fourth
stealing
unawares
upon
the
whale
in
the
fancied
security
of
the
middle
of
solitary
seas
you
find
him
unbent
from
the
vast
corpulence
of
his
dignity
and
kitten-like
he
plays
on
the
ocean
as
if
it
were
a
hearth
but
still
you
see
his
power
in
his
play
the
broad
palms
of
his
tail
are
flirted
high
into
the
air
then
smiting
the
surface
the
thunderous
concussion
resounds
for
miles
you
would
almost
think
a
great
gun
had
been
discharged
and
if
you
noticed
the
light
wreath
of
vapor
from
the
spiracle
at
his
other
extremity
you
would
think
that
that
was
the
smoke
from
the
touch-hole
fifth
as
in
the
ordinary
floating
posture
of
the
leviathan
the
flukes
lie
considerably
below
the
level
of
his
back
they
are
then
completely
out
of
sight
beneath
the
surface
but
when
he
is
about
to
plunge
into
the
deeps
his
entire
flukes
with
at
least
thirty
feet
of
his
body
are
tossed
erect
in
the
air
and
so
remain
vibrating
a
moment
till
they
downwards
shoot
out
of
view
excepting
the
sublime
_breach_—somewhere
else
to
be
described—this
peaking
of
the
whale’s
flukes
is
perhaps
the
grandest
sight
to
be
seen
in
all
animated
nature
out
of
the
bottomless
profundities
the
gigantic
tail
seems
spasmodically
snatching
at
the
highest
heaven
so
in
dreams
have
i
seen
majestic
satan
thrusting
forth
his
tormented
colossal
claw
from
the
flame
baltic
of
hell
but
in
gazing
at
such
scenes
it
is
all
in
all
what
mood
you
are
in
if
in
the
dantean
the
devils
will
occur
to
you
if
in
that
of
isaiah
the
archangels
standing
at
the
mast-head
of
my
ship
during
a
sunrise
that
crimsoned
sky
and
sea
i
once
saw
a
large
herd
of
whales
in
the
east
all
heading
towards
the
sun
and
for
a
moment
vibrating
in
concert
with
peaked
flukes
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
such
a
grand
embodiment
of
adoration
of
the
gods
was
never
beheld
even
in
persia
the
home
of
the
fire
worshippers
as
ptolemy
philopater
testified
of
the
african
elephant
i
then
testified
of
the
whale
pronouncing
him
the
most
devout
of
all
beings
for
according
to
king
juba
the
military
elephants
of
antiquity
often
hailed
the
morning
with
their
trunks
uplifted
in
the
profoundest
silence
the
chance
comparison
in
this
chapter
between
the
whale
and
the
elephant
so
far
as
some
aspects
of
the
tail
of
the
one
and
the
trunk
of
the
other
are
concerned
should
not
tend
to
place
those
two
opposite
organs
on
an
equality
much
less
the
creatures
to
which
they
respectively
belong
for
as
the
mightiest
elephant
is
but
a
terrier
to
leviathan
so
compared
with
leviathan’s
tail
his
trunk
is
but
the
stalk
of
a
lily
the
most
direful
blow
from
the
elephant’s
trunk
were
as
the
playful
tap
of
a
fan
compared
with
the
measureless
crush
and
crash
of
the
sperm
whale’s
ponderous
flukes
which
in
repeated
instances
have
one
after
the
other
hurled
entire
boats
with
all
their
oars
and
crews
into
the
air
very
much
as
an
indian
juggler
tosses
his
balls.*
*though
all
comparison
in
the
way
of
general
bulk
between
the
whale
and
the
elephant
is
preposterous
inasmuch
as
in
that
particular
the
elephant
stands
in
much
the
same
respect
to
the
whale
that
a
dog
does
to
the
elephant
nevertheless
there
are
not
wanting
some
points
of
curious
similitude
among
these
is
the
spout
it
is
well
known
that
the
elephant
will
often
draw
up
water
or
dust
in
his
trunk
and
then
elevating
it
jet
it
forth
in
a
stream
the
more
i
consider
this
mighty
tail
the
more
do
i
deplore
my
inability
to
express
it
at
times
there
are
gestures
in
it
which
though
they
would
well
grace
the
hand
of
man
remain
wholly
inexplicable
in
an
extensive
herd
so
remarkable
occasionally
are
these
mystic
gestures
that
i
have
heard
hunters
who
have
declared
them
akin
to
free-mason
signs
and
symbols
that
the
whale
indeed
by
these
methods
intelligently
conversed
with
the
world
nor
are
there
wanting
other
motions
of
the
whale
in
his
general
body
full
of
strangeness
and
unaccountable
to
his
most
experienced
assailant
dissect
him
how
i
may
then
i
but
go
skin
deep
i
know
him
not
and
never
will
but
if
i
know
not
even
the
tail
of
this
whale
how
understand
his
head
much
more
how
comprehend
his
face
when
face
he
has
none
thou
shalt
see
my
back
parts
my
tail
he
seems
to
say
but
my
face
shall
not
be
seen
but
i
cannot
completely
make
out
his
back
parts
and
hint
what
he
will
about
his
face
i
say
again
he
has
no
face
chapter
87
the
grand
armada
the
long
and
narrow
peninsula
of
malacca
extending
south-eastward
from
the
territories
of
birmah
forms
the
most
southerly
point
of
all
asia
in
a
continuous
line
from
that
peninsula
stretch
the
long
islands
of
sumatra
java
bally
and
timor
which
with
many
others
form
a
vast
mole
or
rampart
lengthwise
connecting
asia
with
australia
and
dividing
the
long
unbroken
indian
ocean
from
the
thickly
studded
oriental
archipelagoes
this
rampart
is
pierced
by
several
sally-ports
for
the
convenience
of
ships
and
whales
conspicuous
among
which
are
the
straits
of
sunda
and
malacca
by
the
straits
of
sunda
chiefly
vessels
bound
to
china
from
the
west
emerge
into
the
china
seas
those
narrow
straits
of
sunda
divide
sumatra
from
java
and
standing
midway
in
that
vast
rampart
of
islands
buttressed
by
that
bold
green
promontory
known
to
seamen
as
java
head
they
not
a
little
correspond
to
the
central
gateway
opening
into
some
vast
walled
empire
and
considering
the
inexhaustible
wealth
of
spices
and
silks
and
jewels
and
gold
and
ivory
with
which
the
thousand
islands
of
that
oriental
sea
are
enriched
it
seems
a
significant
provision
of
nature
that
such
treasures
by
the
very
formation
of
the
land
should
at
least
bear
the
appearance
however
ineffectual
of
being
guarded
from
the
all-grasping
western
world
the
shores
of
the
straits
of
sunda
are
unsupplied
with
those
domineering
fortresses
which
guard
the
entrances
to
the
mediterranean
the
baltic
and
the
propontis
unlike
the
danes
these
orientals
do
not
demand
the
obsequious
homage
of
lowered
top-sails
from
the
endless
procession
of
ships
before
the
wind
which
for
centuries
past
by
night
and
by
day
have
passed
between
the
islands
of
sumatra
and
java
freighted
with
the
costliest
cargoes
of
the
east
but
while
they
freely
waive
a
ceremonial
like
this
they
do
by
no
means
renounce
their
claim
to
more
solid
tribute
time
out
of
mind
the
piratical
proas
of
the
malays
lurking
among
the
low
shaded
coves
and
islets
of
sumatra
have
sallied
out
upon
the
vessels
sailing
through
the
straits
fiercely
demanding
tribute
at
the
point
of
their
spears
though
by
the
repeated
bloody
chastisements
they
have
received
at
the
hands
of
european
cruisers
the
audacity
of
these
corsairs
has
of
late
been
somewhat
repressed
yet
even
at
the
present
day
we
occasionally
hear
of
english
and
american
vessels
which
in
those
waters
have
been
remorselessly
boarded
and
pillaged
with
a
fair
fresh
wind
the
pequod
was
now
drawing
nigh
to
these
straits
ahab
purposing
to
pass
through
them
into
the
javan
sea
and
thence
cruising
northwards
over
waters
known
to
be
frequented
here
and
there
by
the
sperm
whale
sweep
inshore
by
the
philippine
islands
and
gain
the
far
coast
of
japan
in
time
for
the
great
whaling
season
there
by
these
means
the
circumnavigating
pequod
would
sweep
almost
all
the
known
sperm
whale
cruising
grounds
of
the
world
previous
to
descending
upon
the
line
in
the
pacific
where
ahab
though
everywhere
else
foiled
in
his
pursuit
firmly
counted
upon
giving
battle
to
moby
dick
in
the
sea
he
was
most
known
to
frequent
and
at
a
season
when
he
might
most
reasonably
be
presumed
to
be
haunting
it
but
how
now
in
this
zoned
quest
does
ahab
touch
no
land
does
his
crew
drink
air
surely
he
will
stop
for
water
nay
for
a
long
time
now
the
circus-running
sun
has
raced
within
his
fiery
ring
and
needs
no
sustenance
but
what’s
in
himself
so
ahab
mark
this
too
in
the
whaler
while
other
hulls
are
loaded
down
with
alien
stuff
to
be
transferred
to
foreign
wharves
the
world-wandering
whale-ship
carries
no
cargo
but
herself
and
crew
their
weapons
and
their
wants
she
has
a
whole
lake’s
contents
bottled
in
her
ample
hold
she
is
ballasted
with
utilities
not
altogether
with
unusable
pig-lead
and
kentledge
she
carries
years’
water
in
her
clear
old
prime
nantucket
water
which
when
three
years
afloat
the
nantucketer
in
the
pacific
prefers
to
drink
before
the
brackish
fluid
but
yesterday
rafted
off
in
casks
from
the
peruvian
or
indian
streams
hence
it
is
that
while
other
ships
may
have
gone
to
china
from
new
york
and
back
again
touching
at
a
score
of
ports
the
whale-ship
in
all
that
interval
may
not
have
sighted
one
grain
of
soil
her
crew
having
seen
no
man
but
floating
seamen
like
themselves
so
that
did
you
carry
them
the
news
that
another
flood
had
come
they
would
only
answer—“well
boys
here’s
the
ark!”
now
as
many
sperm
whales
had
been
captured
off
the
western
coast
of
java
in
the
near
vicinity
of
the
straits
of
sunda
indeed
as
most
of
the
ground
roundabout
was
generally
recognised
by
the
fishermen
as
an
excellent
spot
for
cruising
therefore
as
the
pequod
gained
more
and
more
upon
java
head
the
look-outs
were
repeatedly
hailed
and
admonished
to
keep
wide
awake
but
though
the
green
palmy
cliffs
of
the
land
soon
loomed
on
the
starboard
bow
and
with
delighted
nostrils
the
fresh
cinnamon
was
snuffed
in
the
air
yet
not
a
single
jet
was
descried
almost
renouncing
all
thought
of
falling
in
with
any
game
hereabouts
the
ship
had
well
nigh
entered
the
straits
when
the
customary
cheering
cry
was
heard
from
aloft
and
ere
long
a
spectacle
of
singular
magnificence
saluted
us
but
here
be
it
premised
that
owing
to
the
unwearied
activity
with
which
of
late
they
have
been
hunted
over
all
four
oceans
the
sperm
whales
instead
of
almost
invariably
sailing
in
small
detached
companies
as
in
former
times
are
now
frequently
met
with
in
extensive
herds
sometimes
embracing
so
great
a
multitude
that
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
numerous
nations
of
them
had
sworn
solemn
league
and
covenant
for
mutual
assistance
and
protection
to
this
aggregation
of
the
sperm
whale
into
such
immense
caravans
may
be
imputed
the
circumstance
that
even
in
the
best
cruising
grounds
you
may
now
sometimes
sail
for
weeks
and
months
together
without
being
greeted
by
a
single
spout
and
then
be
suddenly
saluted
by
what
sometimes
seems
thousands
on
thousands
broad
on
both
bows
at
the
distance
of
some
two
or
three
miles
and
forming
a
great
semicircle
embracing
one
half
of
the
level
horizon
a
continuous
chain
of
whale-jets
were
up-playing
and
sparkling
in
the
noon-day
air
unlike
the
straight
perpendicular
twin-jets
of
the
right
whale
which
dividing
at
top
fall
over
in
two
branches
like
the
cleft
drooping
boughs
of
a
willow
the
single
forward-slanting
spout
of
the
sperm
whale
presents
a
thick
curled
bush
of
white
mist
continually
rising
and
falling
away
to
leeward
seen
from
the
pequod’s
deck
then
as
she
would
rise
on
a
high
hill
of
the
sea
this
host
of
vapory
spouts
individually
curling
up
into
the
air
and
beheld
through
a
blending
atmosphere
of
bluish
haze
showed
like
the
thousand
cheerful
chimneys
of
some
dense
metropolis
descried
of
a
balmy
autumnal
morning
by
some
horseman
on
a
height
as
marching
armies
approaching
an
unfriendly
defile
in
the
mountains
accelerate
their
march
all
eagerness
to
place
that
perilous
passage
in
their
rear
and
once
more
expand
in
comparative
security
upon
the
plain
even
so
did
this
vast
fleet
of
whales
now
seem
hurrying
forward
through
the
straits
gradually
contracting
the
wings
of
their
semicircle
and
swimming
on
in
one
solid
but
still
crescentic
centre
crowding
all
sail
the
pequod
pressed
after
them
the
harpooneers
handling
their
weapons
and
loudly
cheering
from
the
heads
of
their
yet
suspended
boats
if
the
wind
only
held
little
doubt
had
they
that
chased
through
these
straits
of
sunda
the
vast
host
would
only
deploy
into
the
oriental
seas
to
witness
the
capture
of
not
a
few
of
their
number
and
who
could
tell
whether
in
that
congregated
caravan
moby
dick
himself
might
not
temporarily
be
swimming
like
the
worshipped
white-elephant
in
the
coronation
procession
of
the
siamese
so
with
stun-sail
piled
on
stun-sail
we
sailed
along
driving
these
leviathans
before
us
when
of
a
sudden
the
voice
of
tashtego
was
heard
loudly
directing
attention
to
something
in
our
wake
corresponding
to
the
crescent
in
our
van
we
beheld
another
in
our
rear
it
seemed
formed
of
detached
white
vapors
rising
and
falling
something
like
the
spouts
of
the
whales
only
they
did
not
so
completely
come
and
go
for
they
constantly
hovered
without
finally
disappearing
levelling
his
glass
at
this
sight
ahab
quickly
revolved
in
his
pivot-hole
crying
“aloft
there
and
rig
whips
and
buckets
to
wet
the
sails;—malays
sir
and
after
us!”
as
if
too
long
lurking
behind
the
headlands
till
the
pequod
should
fairly
have
entered
the
straits
these
rascally
asiatics
were
now
in
hot
pursuit
to
make
up
for
their
over-cautious
delay
but
when
the
swift
pequod
with
a
fresh
leading
wind
was
herself
in
hot
chase
how
very
kind
of
these
tawny
philanthropists
to
assist
in
speeding
her
on
to
her
own
chosen
pursuit,—mere
riding-whips
and
rowels
to
her
that
they
were
as
with
glass
under
arm
ahab
to-and-fro
paced
the
deck
in
his
forward
turn
beholding
the
monsters
he
chased
and
in
the
after
one
the
bloodthirsty
pirates
chasing
_him_
some
such
fancy
as
the
above
seemed
his
and
when
he
glanced
upon
the
green
walls
of
the
watery
defile
in
which
the
ship
was
then
sailing
and
bethought
him
that
through
that
gate
lay
the
route
to
his
vengeance
and
beheld
how
that
through
that
same
gate
he
was
now
both
chasing
and
being
chased
to
his
deadly
end
and
not
only
that
but
a
herd
of
remorseless
wild
pirates
and
inhuman
atheistical
devils
were
infernally
cheering
him
on
with
their
curses;—when
all
these
conceits
had
passed
through
his
brain
ahab’s
brow
was
left
gaunt
and
ribbed
like
the
black
sand
beach
after
some
stormy
tide
has
been
gnawing
it
without
being
able
to
drag
the
firm
thing
from
its
place
but
thoughts
like
these
troubled
very
few
of
the
reckless
crew
and
when
after
steadily
dropping
and
dropping
the
pirates
astern
the
pequod
at
last
shot
by
the
vivid
green
cockatoo
point
on
the
sumatra
side
emerging
at
last
upon
the
broad
waters
beyond
then
the
harpooneers
seemed
more
to
grieve
that
the
swift
whales
had
been
gaining
upon
the
ship
than
to
rejoice
that
the
ship
had
so
victoriously
gained
upon
the
malays
but
still
driving
on
in
the
wake
of
the
whales
at
length
they
seemed
abating
their
speed
gradually
the
ship
neared
them
and
the
wind
now
dying
away
word
was
passed
to
spring
to
the
boats
but
no
sooner
did
the
herd
by
some
presumed
wonderful
instinct
of
the
sperm
whale
become
notified
of
the
three
keels
that
were
after
them,—though
as
yet
a
mile
in
their
rear,—than
they
rallied
again
and
forming
in
close
ranks
and
battalions
so
that
their
spouts
all
looked
like
flashing
lines
of
stacked
bayonets
moved
on
with
redoubled
velocity
stripped
to
our
shirts
and
drawers
we
sprang
to
the
white-ash
and
after
several
hours’
pulling
were
almost
disposed
to
renounce
the
chase
when
a
general
pausing
commotion
among
the
whales
gave
animating
token
that
they
were
now
at
last
under
the
influence
of
that
strange
perplexity
of
inert
irresolution
which
when
the
fishermen
perceive
it
in
the
whale
they
say
he
is
gallied
the
compact
martial
columns
in
which
they
had
been
hitherto
rapidly
and
steadily
swimming
were
now
broken
up
in
one
measureless
rout
and
like
king
porus’
elephants
in
the
indian
battle
with
alexander
they
seemed
going
mad
with
consternation
in
all
directions
expanding
in
vast
irregular
circles
and
aimlessly
swimming
hither
and
thither
by
their
short
thick
spoutings
they
plainly
betrayed
their
distraction
of
panic
this
was
still
more
strangely
evinced
by
those
of
their
number
who
completely
paralysed
as
it
were
helplessly
floated
like
water-logged
dismantled
ships
on
the
sea
had
these
leviathans
been
but
a
flock
of
simple
sheep
pursued
over
the
pasture
by
three
fierce
wolves
they
could
not
possibly
have
evinced
such
excessive
dismay
but
this
occasional
timidity
is
characteristic
of
almost
all
herding
creatures
though
banding
together
in
tens
of
thousands
the
lion-maned
buffaloes
of
the
west
have
fled
before
a
solitary
horseman
witness
too
all
human
beings
how
when
herded
together
in
the
sheepfold
of
a
theatre’s
pit
they
will
at
the
slightest
alarm
of
fire
rush
helter-skelter
for
the
outlets
crowding
trampling
jamming
and
remorselessly
dashing
each
other
to
death
best
therefore
withhold
any
amazement
at
the
strangely
gallied
whales
before
us
for
there
is
no
folly
of
the
beasts
of
the
earth
which
is
not
infinitely
outdone
by
the
madness
of
men
though
many
of
the
whales
as
has
been
said
were
in
violent
motion
yet
it
is
to
be
observed
that
as
a
whole
the
herd
neither
advanced
nor
retreated
but
collectively
remained
in
one
place
as
is
customary
in
those
cases
the
boats
at
once
separated
each
making
for
some
one
lone
whale
on
the
outskirts
of
the
shoal
in
about
three
minutes’
time
queequeg’s
harpoon
was
flung
the
stricken
fish
darted
blinding
spray
in
our
faces
and
then
running
away
with
us
like
light
steered
straight
for
the
heart
of
the
herd
though
such
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
whale
struck
under
such
circumstances
is
in
no
wise
unprecedented
and
indeed
is
almost
always
more
or
less
anticipated
yet
does
it
present
one
of
the
more
perilous
vicissitudes
of
the
fishery
for
as
the
swift
monster
drags
you
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
frantic
shoal
you
bid
adieu
to
circumspect
life
and
only
exist
in
a
delirious
throb
as
blind
and
deaf
the
whale
plunged
forward
as
if
by
sheer
power
of
speed
to
rid
himself
of
the
iron
leech
that
had
fastened
to
him
as
we
thus
tore
a
white
gash
in
the
sea
on
all
sides
menaced
as
we
flew
by
the
crazed
creatures
to
and
fro
rushing
about
us
our
beset
boat
was
like
a
ship
mobbed
by
ice-isles
in
a
tempest
and
striving
to
steer
through
their
complicated
channels
and
straits
knowing
not
at
what
moment
it
may
be
locked
in
and
crushed
but
not
a
bit
daunted
queequeg
steered
us
manfully
now
sheering
off
from
this
monster
directly
across
our
route
in
advance
now
edging
away
from
that
whose
colossal
flukes
were
suspended
overhead
while
all
the
time
starbuck
stood
up
in
the
bows
lance
in
hand
pricking
out
of
our
way
whatever
whales
he
could
reach
by
short
darts
for
there
was
no
time
to
make
long
ones
nor
were
the
oarsmen
quite
idle
though
their
wonted
duty
was
now
altogether
dispensed
with
they
chiefly
attended
to
the
shouting
part
of
the
business
“out
of
the
way
commodore!”
cried
one
to
a
great
dromedary
that
of
a
sudden
rose
bodily
to
the
surface
and
for
an
instant
threatened
to
swamp
us
“hard
down
with
your
tail
there!”
cried
a
second
to
another
which
close
to
our
gunwale
seemed
calmly
cooling
himself
with
his
own
fan-like
extremity
all
whaleboats
carry
certain
curious
contrivances
originally
invented
by
the
nantucket
indians
called
druggs
two
thick
squares
of
wood
of
equal
size
are
stoutly
clenched
together
so
that
they
cross
each
other’s
grain
at
right
angles
a
line
of
considerable
length
is
then
attached
to
the
middle
of
this
block
and
the
other
end
of
the
line
being
looped
it
can
in
a
moment
be
fastened
to
a
harpoon
it
is
chiefly
among
gallied
whales
that
this
drugg
is
used
for
then
more
whales
are
close
round
you
than
you
can
possibly
chase
at
one
time
but
sperm
whales
are
not
every
day
encountered
while
you
may
then
you
must
kill
all
you
can
and
if
you
cannot
kill
them
all
at
once
you
must
wing
them
so
that
they
can
be
afterwards
killed
at
your
leisure
hence
it
is
that
at
times
like
these
the
drugg
comes
into
requisition
our
boat
was
furnished
with
three
of
them
the
first
and
second
were
successfully
darted
and
we
saw
the
whales
staggeringly
running
off
fettered
by
the
enormous
sidelong
resistance
of
the
towing
drugg
they
were
cramped
like
malefactors
with
the
chain
and
ball
but
upon
flinging
the
third
in
the
act
of
tossing
overboard
the
clumsy
wooden
block
it
caught
under
one
of
the
seats
of
the
boat
and
in
an
instant
tore
it
out
and
carried
it
away
dropping
the
oarsman
in
the
boat’s
bottom
as
the
seat
slid
from
under
him
on
both
sides
the
sea
came
in
at
the
wounded
planks
but
we
stuffed
two
or
three
drawers
and
shirts
in
and
so
stopped
the
leaks
for
the
time
it
had
been
next
to
impossible
to
dart
these
drugged-harpoons
were
it
not
that
as
we
advanced
into
the
herd
our
whale’s
way
greatly
diminished
moreover
that
as
we
went
still
further
and
further
from
the
circumference
of
commotion
the
direful
disorders
seemed
waning
so
that
when
at
last
the
jerking
harpoon
drew
out
and
the
towing
whale
sideways
vanished
then
with
the
tapering
force
of
his
parting
momentum
we
glided
between
two
whales
into
the
innermost
heart
of
the
shoal
as
if
from
some
mountain
torrent
we
had
slid
into
a
serene
valley
lake
here
the
storms
in
the
roaring
glens
between
the
outermost
whales
were
heard
but
not
felt
in
this
central
expanse
the
sea
presented
that
smooth
satin-like
surface
called
a
sleek
produced
by
the
subtle
moisture
thrown
off
by
the
whale
in
his
more
quiet
moods
yes
we
were
now
in
that
enchanted
calm
which
they
say
lurks
at
the
heart
of
every
commotion
and
still
in
the
distracted
distance
we
beheld
the
tumults
of
the
outer
concentric
circles
and
saw
successive
pods
of
whales
eight
or
ten
in
each
swiftly
going
round
and
round
like
multiplied
spans
of
horses
in
a
ring
and
so
closely
shoulder
to
shoulder
that
a
titanic
circus-rider
might
easily
have
over-arched
the
middle
ones
and
so
have
gone
round
on
their
backs
owing
to
the
density
of
the
crowd
of
reposing
whales
more
immediately
surrounding
the
embayed
axis
of
the
herd
no
possible
chance
of
escape
was
at
present
afforded
us
we
must
watch
for
a
breach
in
the
living
wall
that
hemmed
us
in
the
wall
that
had
only
admitted
us
in
order
to
shut
us
up
keeping
at
the
centre
of
the
lake
we
were
occasionally
visited
by
small
tame
cows
and
calves
the
women
and
children
of
this
routed
host
now
inclusive
of
the
occasional
wide
intervals
between
the
revolving
outer
circles
and
inclusive
of
the
spaces
between
the
various
pods
in
any
one
of
those
circles
the
entire
area
at
this
juncture
embraced
by
the
whole
multitude
must
have
contained
at
least
two
or
three
square
miles
at
any
rate—though
indeed
such
a
test
at
such
a
time
might
be
deceptive—spoutings
might
be
discovered
from
our
low
boat
that
seemed
playing
up
almost
from
the
rim
of
the
horizon
i
mention
this
circumstance
because
as
if
the
cows
and
calves
had
been
purposely
locked
up
in
this
innermost
fold
and
as
if
the
wide
extent
of
the
herd
had
hitherto
prevented
them
from
learning
the
precise
cause
of
its
stopping
or
possibly
being
so
young
unsophisticated
and
every
way
innocent
and
inexperienced
however
it
may
have
been
these
smaller
whales—now
and
then
visiting
our
becalmed
boat
from
the
margin
of
the
lake—evinced
a
wondrous
fearlessness
and
confidence
or
else
a
still
becharmed
panic
which
it
was
impossible
not
to
marvel
at
like
household
dogs
they
came
snuffling
round
us
right
up
to
our
gunwales
and
touching
them
till
it
almost
seemed
that
some
spell
had
suddenly
domesticated
them
queequeg
patted
their
foreheads
starbuck
scratched
their
backs
with
his
lance
but
fearful
of
the
consequences
for
the
time
refrained
from
darting
it
but
far
beneath
this
wondrous
world
upon
the
surface
another
and
still
stranger
world
met
our
eyes
as
we
gazed
over
the
side
for
suspended
in
those
watery
vaults
floated
the
forms
of
the
nursing
mothers
of
the
whales
and
those
that
by
their
enormous
girth
seemed
shortly
to
become
mothers
the
lake
as
i
have
hinted
was
to
a
considerable
depth
exceedingly
transparent
and
as
human
infants
while
suckling
will
calmly
and
fixedly
gaze
away
from
the
breast
as
if
leading
two
different
lives
at
the
time
and
while
yet
drawing
mortal
nourishment
be
still
spiritually
feasting
upon
some
unearthly
reminiscence;—even
so
did
the
young
of
these
whales
seem
looking
up
towards
us
but
not
at
us
as
if
we
were
but
a
bit
of
gulfweed
in
their
new-born
sight
floating
on
their
sides
the
mothers
also
seemed
quietly
eyeing
us
one
of
these
little
infants
that
from
certain
queer
tokens
seemed
hardly
a
day
old
might
have
measured
some
fourteen
feet
in
length
and
some
six
feet
in
girth
he
was
a
little
frisky
though
as
yet
his
body
seemed
scarce
yet
recovered
from
that
irksome
position
it
had
so
lately
occupied
in
the
maternal
reticule
where
tail
to
head
and
all
ready
for
the
final
spring
the
unborn
whale
lies
bent
like
a
tartar’s
bow
the
delicate
side-fins
and
the
palms
of
his
flukes
still
freshly
retained
the
plaited
crumpled
appearance
of
a
baby’s
ears
newly
arrived
from
foreign
parts
“line
line!”
cried
queequeg
looking
over
the
gunwale
“him
fast
him
fast!—who
line
him
who
struck?—two
whale
one
big
one
little!”
“what
ails
ye
man?”
cried
starbuck
“look-e
here,”
said
queequeg
pointing
down
as
when
the
stricken
whale
that
from
the
tub
has
reeled
out
hundreds
of
fathoms
of
rope
as
after
deep
sounding
he
floats
up
again
and
shows
the
slackened
curling
line
buoyantly
rising
and
spiralling
towards
the
air
so
now
starbuck
saw
long
coils
of
the
umbilical
cord
of
madame
leviathan
by
which
the
young
cub
seemed
still
tethered
to
its
dam
not
seldom
in
the
rapid
vicissitudes
of
the
chase
this
natural
line
with
the
maternal
end
loose
becomes
entangled
with
the
hempen
one
so
that
the
cub
is
thereby
trapped
some
of
the
subtlest
secrets
of
the
seas
seemed
divulged
to
us
in
this
enchanted
pond
we
saw
young
leviathan
amours
in
the
deep.*
*the
sperm
whale
as
with
all
other
species
of
the
leviathan
but
unlike
most
other
fish
breeds
indifferently
at
all
seasons
after
a
gestation
which
may
probably
be
set
down
at
nine
months
producing
but
one
at
a
time
though
in
some
few
known
instances
giving
birth
to
an

and
jacob:—a
contingency
provided
for
in
suckling
by
two
teats
curiously
situated
one
on
each
side
of
the
anus
but
the
breasts
themselves
extend
upwards
from
that
when
by
chance
these
precious
parts
in
a
nursing
whale
are
cut
by
the
hunter’s
lance
the
mother’s
pouring
milk
and
blood
rivallingly
discolour
the
sea
for
rods
the
milk
is
very
sweet
and
rich
it
has
been
tasted
by
man
it
might
do
well
with
strawberries
when
overflowing
with
mutual
esteem
the
whales
salute
_more
hominum_
and
thus
though
surrounded
by
circle
upon
circle
of
consternations
and
affrights
did
these
inscrutable
creatures
at
the
centre
freely
and
fearlessly
indulge
in
all
peaceful
concernments
yea
serenely
revelled
in
dalliance
and
delight
but
even
so
amid
the
tornadoed
atlantic
of
my
being
do
i
myself
still
for
ever
centrally
disport
in
mute
calm
and
while
ponderous
planets
of
unwaning
woe
revolve
round
me
deep
down
and
deep
inland
there
i
still
bathe
me
in
eternal
mildness
of
joy
meanwhile
as
we
thus
lay
entranced
the
occasional
sudden
frantic
spectacles
in
the
distance
evinced
the
activity
of
the
other
boats
still
engaged
in
drugging
the
whales
on
the
frontier
of
the
host
or
possibly
carrying
on
the
war
within
the
first
circle
where
abundance
of
room
and
some
convenient
retreats
were
afforded
them
but
the
sight
of
the
enraged
drugged
whales
now
and
then
blindly
darting
to
and
fro
across
the
circles
was
nothing
to
what
at
last
met
our
eyes
it
is
sometimes
the
custom
when
fast
to
a
whale
more
than
commonly
powerful
and
alert
to
seek
to
hamstring
him
as
it
were
by
sundering
or
maiming
his
gigantic
tail-tendon
it
is
done
by
darting
a
short-handled
cutting-spade
to
which
is
attached
a
rope
for
hauling
it
back
again
a
whale
wounded
as
we
afterwards
learned
in
this
part
but
not
effectually
as
it
seemed
had
broken
away
from
the
boat
carrying
along
with
him
half
of
the
harpoon
line
and
in
the
extraordinary
agony
of
the
wound
he
was
now
dashing
among
the
revolving
circles
like
the
lone
mounted
desperado
arnold
at
the
battle
of
saratoga
carrying
dismay
wherever
he
went
but
agonizing
as
was
the
wound
of
this
whale
and
an
appalling
spectacle
enough
any
way
yet
the
peculiar
horror
with
which
he
seemed
to
inspire
the
rest
of
the
herd
was
owing
to
a
cause
which
at
first
the
intervening
distance
obscured
from
us
but
at
length
we
perceived
that
by
one
of
the
unimaginable
accidents
of
the
fishery
this
whale
had
become
entangled
in
the
harpoon-line
that
he
towed
he
had
also
run
away
with
the
cutting-spade
in
him
and
while
the
free
end
of
the
rope
attached
to
that
weapon
had
permanently
caught
in
the
coils
of
the
harpoon-line
round
his
tail
the
cutting-spade
itself
had
worked
loose
from
his
flesh
so
that
tormented
to
madness
he
was
now
churning
through
the
water
violently
flailing
with
his
flexible
tail
and
tossing
the
keen
spade
about
him
wounding
and
murdering
his
own
comrades
this
terrific
object
seemed
to
recall
the
whole
herd
from
their
stationary
fright
first
the
whales
forming
the
margin
of
our
lake
began
to
crowd
a
little
and
tumble
against
each
other
as
if
lifted
by
half
spent
billows
from
afar
then
the
lake
itself
began
faintly
to
heave
and
swell
the
submarine
bridal-chambers
and
nurseries
vanished
in
more
and
more
contracting
orbits
the
whales
in
the
more
central
circles
began
to
swim
in
thickening
clusters
yes
the
long
calm
was
departing
a
low
advancing
hum
was
soon
heard
and
then
like
to
the
tumultuous
masses
of
block-ice
when
the
great
river
hudson
breaks
up
in
spring
the
entire
host
of
whales
came
tumbling
upon
their
inner
centre
as
if
to
pile
themselves
up
in
one
common
mountain
instantly
starbuck
and
queequeg
changed
places
starbuck
taking
the
stern
“oars
oars!”
he
intensely
whispered
seizing
the
helm—“gripe
your
oars
and
clutch
your
souls
now
my
god
men
stand
by
shove
him
off
you
queequeg—the
whale
there!—prick
him!—hit
him
stand
up—stand
up
and
stay
so
spring
men—pull
men
never
mind
their
backs—scrape
them!—scrape
away!”
the
boat
was
now
all
but
jammed
between
two
vast
black
bulks
leaving
a
narrow
dardanelles
between
their
long
lengths
but
by
desperate
endeavor
we
at
last
shot
into
a
temporary
opening
then
giving
way
rapidly
and
at
the
same
time
earnestly
watching
for
another
outlet
after
many
similar
hair-breadth
escapes
we
at
last
swiftly
glided
into
what
had
just
been
one
of
the
outer
circles
but
now
crossed
by
random
whales
all
violently
making
for
one
centre
this
lucky
salvation
was
cheaply
purchased
by
the
loss
of
queequeg’s
hat
who
while
standing
in
the
bows
to
prick
the
fugitive
whales
had
his
hat
taken
clean
from
his
head
by
the
air-eddy
made
by
the
sudden
tossing
of
a
pair
of
broad
flukes
close
by
riotous
and
disordered
as
the
universal
commotion
now
was
it
soon
resolved
itself
into
what
seemed
a
systematic
movement
for
having
clumped
together
at
last
in
one
dense
body
they
then
renewed
their
onward
flight
with
augmented
fleetness
further
pursuit
was
useless
but
the
boats
still
lingered
in
their
wake
to
pick
up
what
drugged
whales
might
be
dropped
astern
and
likewise
to
secure
one
which
flask
had
killed
and
waifed
the
waif
is
a
pennoned
pole
two
or
three
of
which
are
carried
by
every
boat
and
which
when
additional
game
is
at
hand
are
inserted
upright
into
the
floating
body
of
a
dead
whale
both
to
mark
its
place
on
the
sea
and
also
as
token
of
prior
possession
should
the
boats
of
any
other
ship
draw
near
the
result
of
this
lowering
was
somewhat
illustrative
of
that
sagacious
saying
in
the
fishery,—the
more
whales
the
less
fish
of
all
the
drugged
whales
only
one
was
captured
the
rest
contrived
to
escape
for
the
time
but
only
to
be
taken
as
will
hereafter
be
seen
by
some
other
craft
than
the
pequod

88
schools
and
schoolmasters
the
previous
chapter
gave
account
of
an
immense
body
or
herd
of
sperm
whales
and
there
was
also
then
given
the
probable
cause
inducing
those
vast
aggregations
now
though
such
great
bodies
are
at
times
encountered
yet
as
must
have
been
seen
even
at
the
present
day
small
detached
bands
are
occasionally
observed
embracing
from
twenty
to
fifty
individuals
each
such
bands
are
known
as
schools
they
generally
are
of
two
sorts
those
composed
almost
entirely
of
females
and
those
mustering
none
but
young
vigorous
males
or
bulls
as
they
are
familiarly
designated
in
cavalier
attendance
upon
the
school
of
females
you
invariably
see
a
male
of
full
grown
magnitude
but
not
old
who
upon
any
alarm
evinces
his
gallantry
by
falling
in
the
rear
and
covering
the
flight
of
his
ladies
in
truth
this
gentleman
is
a
luxurious
ottoman
swimming
about
over
the
watery
world
surroundingly
accompanied
by
all
the
solaces
and
endearments
of
the
harem
the
contrast
between
this
ottoman
and
his
concubines
is
striking
because
while
he
is
always
of
the
largest
leviathanic
proportions
the
ladies
even
at
full
growth
are
not
more
than
one-third
of
the
bulk
of
an
average-sized
male
they
are
comparatively
delicate
indeed
i
dare
say
not
to
exceed
half
a
dozen
yards
round
the
waist
nevertheless
it
cannot
be
denied
that
upon
the
whole
they
are
hereditarily
entitled
to
_en
bon
point_
it
is
very
curious
to
watch
this
harem
and
its
lord
in
their
indolent
ramblings
like
fashionables
they
are
for
ever
on
the
move
in
leisurely
search
of
variety
you
meet
them
on
the
line
in
time
for
the
full
flower
of
the
equatorial
feeding
season
having
just
returned
perhaps
from
spending
the
summer
in
the
northern
seas
and
so
cheating
summer
of
all
unpleasant
weariness
and
warmth
by
the
time
they
have
lounged
up
and
down
the
promenade
of
the
equator
awhile
they
start
for
the
oriental
waters
in
anticipation
of
the
cool
season
there
and
so
evade
the
other
excessive
temperature
of
the
year
when
serenely
advancing
on
one
of
these
journeys
if
any
strange
suspicious
sights
are
seen
my
lord
whale
keeps
a
wary
eye
on
his
interesting
family
should
any
unwarrantably
pert
young
leviathan
coming
that
way
presume
to
draw
confidentially
close
to
one
of
the
ladies
with
what
prodigious
fury
the
bashaw
assails
him
and
chases
him
away
high
times
indeed
if
unprincipled
young
rakes
like
him
are
to
be
permitted
to
invade
the
sanctity
of
domestic
bliss
though
do
what
the
bashaw
will
he
cannot
keep
the
most
notorious
lothario
out
of
his
bed
for
alas
all
fish
bed
in
common
as
ashore
the
ladies
often
cause
the
most
terrible
duels
among
their
rival
admirers
just
so
with
the
whales
who
sometimes
come
to
deadly
battle
and
all
for
love
they
fence
with
their
long
lower
jaws
sometimes
locking
them
together
and
so
striving
for
the
supremacy
like
elks
that
warringly
interweave
their
antlers
not
a
few
are
captured
having
the
deep
scars
of
these
encounters,—furrowed
heads
broken
teeth
scolloped
fins
and
in
some
instances
wrenched
and
dislocated
mouths
but
supposing
the
invader
of
domestic
bliss
to
betake
himself
away
at
the
first
rush
of
the
harem’s
lord
then
is
it
very
diverting
to
watch
that
lord
gently
he
insinuates
his
vast
bulk
among
them
again
and
revels
there
awhile
still
in
tantalizing
vicinity
to
young
lothario
like
pious
solomon
devoutly
worshipping
among
his
thousand
concubines
granting
other
whales
to
be
in
sight
the
fishermen
will
seldom
give
chase
to
one
of
these
grand
turks
for
these
grand
turks
are
too
lavish
of
their
strength
and
hence
their
unctuousness
is
small
as
for
the
sons
and
the
daughters
they
beget
why
those
sons
and
daughters
must
take
care
of
themselves
at
least
with
only
the
maternal
help
for
like
certain
other
omnivorous
roving
lovers
that
might
be
named
my
lord
whale
has
no
taste
for
the
nursery
however
much
for
the
bower
and
so
being
a
great
traveller
he
leaves
his
anonymous
babies
all
over
the
world
every
baby
an
exotic
in
good
time
nevertheless
as
the
ardour
of
youth
declines
as
years
and
dumps
increase
as
reflection
lends
her
solemn
pauses
in
short
as
a
general
lassitude
overtakes
the
sated
turk
then
a
love
of
ease
and
virtue
supplants
the
love
for
maidens
our
ottoman
enters
upon
the
impotent
repentant
admonitory
stage
of
life
forswears
disbands
the
harem
and
grown
to
an
exemplary
sulky
old
soul
goes
about
all
alone
among
the
meridians
and
parallels
saying
his
prayers
and
warning
each
young
leviathan
from
his
amorous
errors
now
as
the
harem
of
whales
is
called
by
the
fishermen
a
school
so
is
the
lord
and
master
of
that
school
technically
known
as
the
schoolmaster
it
is
therefore
not
in
strict
character
however
admirably
satirical
that
after
going
to
school
himself
he
should
then
go
abroad
inculcating
not
what
he
learned
there
but
the
folly
of
it
his
title
schoolmaster
would
very
naturally
seem
derived
from
the
name
bestowed
upon
the
harem
itself
but
some
have
surmised
that
the
man
who
first
thus
entitled
this
sort
of
ottoman
whale
must
have
read
the
memoirs
of
vidocq
and
informed
himself
what
sort
of
a
country-schoolmaster
that
famous
frenchman
was
in
his
younger
days
and
what
was
the
nature
of
those
occult
lessons
he
inculcated
into
some
of
his
pupils
the
same
secludedness
and
isolation
to
which
the
schoolmaster
whale
betakes
himself
in
his
advancing
years
is
true
of
all
aged
sperm
whales
almost
universally
a
lone
whale—as
a
solitary
leviathan
is
called—proves
an
ancient
one
like
venerable
moss-bearded
daniel
boone
he
will
have
no
one
near
him
but
nature
herself
and
her
he
takes
to
wife
in
the
wilderness
of
waters
and
the
best
of
wives
she
is
though
she
keeps
so
many
moody
secrets
the
schools
composing
none
but
young
and
vigorous
males
previously
mentioned
offer
a
strong
contrast
to
the
harem
schools
for
while
those
female
whales
are
characteristically
timid
the
young
males
or
forty-barrel-bulls
as
they
call
them
are
by
far
the
most
pugnacious
of
all
leviathans
and
proverbially
the
most
dangerous
to
encounter
excepting
those
wondrous
grey-headed
grizzled
whales
sometimes
met
and
these
will
fight
you
like
grim
fiends
exasperated
by
a
penal
gout
the
forty-barrel-bull
schools
are
larger
than
the
harem
schools
like
a
mob
of
young
collegians
they
are
full
of
fight
fun
and
wickedness
tumbling
round
the
world
at
such
a
reckless
rollicking
rate
that
no
prudent
underwriter
would
insure
them
any
more
than
he
would
a
riotous
lad
at
yale
or
harvard
they
soon
relinquish
this
turbulence
though
and
when
about
three-fourths
grown
break
up
and
separately
go
about
in
quest
of
settlements
that
is
harems
another
point
of
difference
between
the
male
and
female
schools
is
still
more
characteristic
of
the
sexes
say
you
strike
a
forty-barrel-bull—poor
devil
all
his
comrades
quit
him
but
strike
a
member
of
the
harem
school
and
her
companions
swim
around
her
with
every
token
of
concern
sometimes
lingering
so
near
her
and
so
long
as
themselves
to
fall
a
prey

fast-fish
and
loose-fish
the
allusion
to
the
waif
and
waif-poles
in
the
last
chapter
but
one
necessitates
some
account
of
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
whale
fishery
of
which
the
waif
may
be
deemed
the
grand
symbol
and
badge
it
frequently
happens
that
when
several
ships
are
cruising
in
company
a
whale
may
be
struck
by
one
vessel
then
escape
and
be
finally
killed
and
captured
by
another
vessel
and
herein
are
indirectly
comprised
many
minor
contingencies
all
partaking
of
this
one
grand
feature
for
example,—after
a
weary
and
perilous
chase
and
capture
of
a
whale
the
body
may
get
loose
from
the
ship
by
reason
of
a
violent
storm
and
drifting
far
away
to
leeward
be
retaken
by
a
second
whaler
who
in
a
calm
snugly
tows
it
alongside
without
risk
of
life
or
line
thus
the
most
vexatious
and
violent
disputes
would
often
arise
between
the
fishermen
were
there
not
some
written
or
unwritten
universal
undisputed
law
applicable
to
all
cases
perhaps
the
only
formal
whaling
code
authorized
by
legislative
enactment
was
that
of
holland
it
was
decreed
by
the
states-general
in
a.d
1695
but
though
no
other
nation
has
ever
had
any
written
whaling
law
yet
the
american
fishermen
have
been
their
own
legislators
and
lawyers
in
this
matter
they
have
provided
a
system
which
for
terse
comprehensiveness
surpasses
justinian’s
pandects
and
the
by-laws
of
the
chinese
society
for
the
suppression
of
meddling
with
other
people’s
business
yes
these
laws
might
be
engraven
on
a
queen
anne’s
farthing
or
the
barb
of
a
harpoon
and
worn
round
the
neck
so
small
are
they

belongs
to
the
party
fast
to
it
ii
a
loose-fish
is
fair
game
for
anybody
who
can
soonest
catch
it
but
what
plays
the
mischief
with
this
masterly
code
is
the
admirable
brevity
of
it
which
necessitates
a
vast
volume
of
commentaries
to
expound
it
first
what
is
a
fast-fish
alive
or
dead
a
fish
is
technically
fast
when
it
is
connected
with
an
occupied
ship
or
boat
by
any
medium
at
all
controllable
by
the
occupant
or
occupants,—a
mast
an
oar
a
nine-inch
cable
a
telegraph
wire
or
a
strand
of
cobweb
it
is
all
the
same
likewise
a
fish
is
technically
fast
when
it
bears
a
waif
or
any
other
recognised
symbol
of
possession
so
long
as
the
party
waifing
it
plainly
evince
their
ability
at
any
time
to
take
it
alongside
as
well
as
their
intention
so
to
do
these
are
scientific
commentaries
but
the
commentaries
of
the
whalemen
themselves
sometimes
consist
in
hard
words
and
harder
knocks—the

allowances
are
always
made
for
peculiar
cases
where
it
would
be
an
outrageous
moral
injustice
for
one
party
to
claim
possession
of
a
whale
previously
chased
or
killed
by
another
party
but
others
are
by
no
means
so
scrupulous
some
fifty
years
ago
there
was
a
curious
case
of
whale-trover
litigated
in
england
wherein
the
plaintiffs
set
forth
that
after
a
hard
chase
of
a
whale
in
the
northern
seas
and
when
indeed
they
the
plaintiffs
had
succeeded
in
harpooning
the
fish
they
were
at
last
through
peril
of
their
lives
obliged
to
forsake
not
only
their
lines
but
their
boat
itself
ultimately
the
defendants
the
crew
of
another
ship
came
up
with
the
whale
struck
killed
seized
and
finally
appropriated
it
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
plaintiffs
and
when
those
defendants
were
remonstrated
with
their
captain
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
plaintiffs’
teeth
and
assured
them
that
by
way
of
doxology
to
the
deed
he
had
done
he
would
now
retain
their
line
harpoons
and
boat
which
had
remained
attached
to
the
whale
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
wherefore
the
plaintiffs
now
sued
for
the
recovery
of
the
value
of
their
whale
line
harpoons
and
boat
mr
erskine
was
counsel
for
the
defendants
lord
ellenborough
was
the
judge
in
the
course
of
the
defence
the
witty
erskine
went
on
to
illustrate
his
position
by
alluding
to
a
recent
crim
con
case
wherein
a
gentleman
after
in
vain
trying
to
bridle
his
wife’s
viciousness
had
at
last
abandoned
her
upon
the
seas
of
life
but
in
the
course
of
years
repenting
of
that
step
he
instituted
an
action
to
recover
possession
of
her
erskine
was
on
the
other
side
and
he
then
supported
it
by
saying
that
though
the
gentleman
had
originally
harpooned
the
lady
and
had
once
had
her
fast
and
only
by
reason
of
the
great
stress
of
her
plunging
viciousness
had
at
last
abandoned
her
yet
abandon
her
he
did
so
that
she
became
a
loose-fish
and
therefore
when
a
subsequent
gentleman
re-harpooned
her
the
lady
then
became
that
subsequent
gentleman’s
property
along
with
whatever
harpoon
might
have
been
found
sticking
in
her
now
in
the
present
case
erskine
contended
that
the
examples
of
the
whale
and
the
lady
were
reciprocally
illustrative
of
each
other
these
pleadings
and
the
counter
pleadings
being
duly
heard
the
very
learned
judge
in
set
terms
decided
to
wit,—that
as
for
the
boat
he
awarded
it
to
the
plaintiffs
because
they
had
merely
abandoned
it
to
save
their
lives
but
that
with
regard
to
the
controverted
whale
harpoons
and
line
they
belonged
to
the
defendants
the
whale
because
it
was
a
loose-fish
at
the
time
of
the
final
capture
and
the
harpoons
and
line
because
when
the
fish
made
off
with
them
it
the
fish
acquired
a
property
in
those
articles
and
hence
anybody
who
afterwards
took
the
fish
had
a
right
to
them
now
the
defendants
afterwards
took
the
fish
ergo
the
aforesaid
articles
were
theirs
a
common
man
looking
at
this
decision
of
the
very
learned
judge
might
possibly
object
to
it
but
ploughed
up
to
the
primary
rock
of
the
matter
the
two
great
principles
laid
down
in
the
twin
whaling
laws
previously
quoted
and
applied
and
elucidated
by
lord
ellenborough
in
the
above
cited
case
these
two
laws
touching
fast-fish
and
loose-fish
i
say
will
on
reflection
be
found
the
fundamentals
of
all
human
jurisprudence
for
notwithstanding
its
complicated
tracery
of
sculpture
the
temple
of
the
law
like
the
temple
of
the
philistines
has
but
two
props
to
stand
on
is
it
not
a
saying
in
every
one’s
mouth
possession
is
half
of
the
law
that
is
regardless
of
how
the
thing
came
into
possession
but
often
possession
is
the
whole
of
the
law
what
are
the
sinews
and
souls
of
russian
serfs
and
republican
slaves
but
fast-fish
whereof
possession
is
the
whole
of
the
law
what
to
the
rapacious
landlord
is
the
widow’s
last
mite
but
a
fast-fish
what
is
yonder
undetected
villain’s
marble
mansion
with
a
door-plate
for
a
waif
what
is
that
but
a
fast-fish
what
is
the
ruinous
discount
which
mordecai
the
broker
gets
from
poor
woebegone
the
bankrupt
on
a
loan
to
keep
woebegone’s
family
from
starvation
what
is
that
ruinous
discount
but
a
fast-fish
what
is
the
archbishop
of
savesoul’s
income
of
£100,000
seized
from
the
scant
bread
and
cheese
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
broken-backed
laborers
all
sure
of
heaven
without
any
of
savesoul’s
help
what
is
that
globular
£100,000
but
a
fast-fish
what
are
the
duke
of
dunder’s
hereditary
towns
and
hamlets
but
fast-fish
what
to
that
redoubted
harpooneer
john
bull
is
poor
ireland
but
a
fast-fish
what
to
that
apostolic
lancer
brother
jonathan
is
texas
but
a
fast-fish
and
concerning
all
these
is
not
possession
the
whole
of
the
law
but
if
the
doctrine
of
fast-fish
be
pretty
generally
applicable
the
kindred
doctrine
of
loose-fish
is
still
more
widely
so
that
is
internationally
and
universally
applicable
what
was
america
in
1492
but
a
loose-fish
in
which
columbus
struck
the
spanish
standard
by
way
of
waifing
it
for
his
royal
master
and

what

what
at

all

latin
from
the
books
of
the
laws
of
england
which
taken
along
with
the
context
means
that
of
all
whales
captured
by
anybody
on
the
coast
of
that
land
the
king
as
honorary
grand
harpooneer
must
have
the
head
and
the
queen
be
respectfully
presented
with
the
tail
a
division
which
in
the
whale
is
much
like
halving
an
apple
there
is
no
intermediate
remainder
now
as
this
law
under
a
modified
form
is
to
this
day
in
force
in
england
and
as
it
offers
in
various
respects
a
strange
anomaly
touching
the
general
law
of
fast
and
loose-fish
it
is
here
treated
of
in
a
separate
chapter
on
the
same
courteous
principle
that
prompts
the
english
railways
to
be
at
the
expense
of
a
separate
car
specially
reserved
for
the
accommodation
of
royalty
in
the
first
place
in
curious
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
above-mentioned
law
is
still
in
force
i
proceed
to
lay
before
you
a
circumstance
that
happened
within
the
last
two
years
it
seems
that
some
honest
mariners
of
dover
or
sandwich
or
some
one
of
the
cinque
ports
had
after
a
hard
chase
succeeded
in
killing
and
beaching
a
fine
whale
which
they
had
originally
descried
afar
off
from
the
shore
now
the
cinque
ports
are
partially
or
somehow
under
the
jurisdiction
of
a
sort
of
policeman
or
beadle
called
a
lord
warden
holding
the
office
directly
from
the
crown
i
believe
all
the
royal
emoluments
incident
to
the
cinque
port
territories
become
by
assignment
his
by
some
writers
this
office
is
called
a
sinecure
but
not
so
because
the
lord
warden
is
busily
employed
at
times
in
fobbing
his
perquisites
which
are
his
chiefly
by
virtue
of
that
same
fobbing
of
them
now
when
these
poor
sun-burnt
mariners
bare-footed
and
with
their
trowsers
rolled
high
up
on
their
eely
legs
had
wearily
hauled
their
fat
fish
high
and
dry
promising
themselves
a
good
£150
from
the
precious
oil
and
bone
and
in
fantasy
sipping
rare
tea
with
their
wives
and
good
ale
with
their
cronies
upon
the
strength
of
their
respective
shares
up
steps
a
very
learned
and
most
christian
and
charitable
gentleman
with
a
copy
of
blackstone
under
his
arm
and
laying
it
upon
the
whale’s
head
he
says—“hands
off
this
fish
my
masters
is
a
fast-fish
i
seize
it
as
the
lord
warden’s.”
upon
this
the
poor
mariners
in
their
respectful
consternation—so
truly
english—knowing
not
what
to
say
fall
to
vigorously
scratching
their
heads
all
round
meanwhile
ruefully
glancing
from
the
whale
to
the
stranger
but
that
did
in
nowise
mend
the
matter
or
at
all
soften
the
hard
heart
of
the
learned
gentleman
with
the
copy
of
blackstone
at
length
one
of
them
after
long
scratching
about
for
his
ideas
made
bold
to
speak
“please
sir
who
is
the
lord
warden?”
“the
duke.”
“but
the
duke
had
nothing
to
do
with
taking
this
fish?”
“it
is
his.”
“we
have
been
at
great
trouble
and
peril
and
some
expense
and
is
all
that
to
go
to
the
duke’s
benefit
we
getting
nothing
at
all
for
our
pains
but
our
blisters?”
“it
is
his.”
“is
the
duke
so
very
poor
as
to
be
forced
to
this
desperate
mode
of
getting
a
livelihood?”
“it
is
his.”
“i
thought
to
relieve
my
old
bed-ridden
mother
by
part
of
my
share
of
this
whale.”
“it
is
his.”
“won’t
the
duke
be
content
with
a
quarter
or
a
half?”
“it
is
his.”
in
a
word
the
whale
was
seized
and
sold
and
his
grace
the
duke
of
wellington
received
the
money
thinking
that
viewed
in
some
particular
lights
the
case
might
by
a
bare
possibility
in
some
small
degree
be
deemed
under
the
circumstances
a
rather
hard
one
an
honest
clergyman
of
the
town
respectfully
addressed
a
note
to
his
grace
begging
him
to
take
the
case
of
those
unfortunate
mariners
into
full
consideration
to
which
my
lord
duke
in
substance
replied
both
letters
were
published
that
he
had
already
done
so
and
received
the
money
and
would
be
obliged
to
the
reverend
gentleman
if
for
the
future
he
the
reverend
gentleman
would
decline
meddling
with
other
people’s
business
is
this
the
still
militant
old
man
standing
at
the
corners
of
the
three
kingdoms
on
all
hands
coercing
alms
of
beggars
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
in
this
case
the
alleged
right
of
the
duke
to
the
whale
was
a
delegated
one
from
the
sovereign
we
must
needs
inquire
then
on
what
principle
the
sovereign
is
originally
invested
with
that
right
the
law
itself
has
already
been
set
forth
but
plowdon
gives
us
the
reason
for
it
says
plowdon
the
whale
so
caught
belongs
to
the
king
and
queen
“because
of
its
superior
excellence.”
and
by
the
soundest
commentators
this
has
ever
been
held
a
cogent
argument
in
such
matters
but
why
should
the
king
have
the
head
and
the
queen
the
tail
a
reason
for
that
ye
lawyers
in
his
treatise
on
“queen-gold,”
or
queen-pinmoney
an
old
king’s
bench
author
one
william
prynne
thus
discourseth
“ye
tail
is
ye
queen’s
that
ye
queen’s
wardrobe
may
be
supplied
with
ye
whalebone.”
now
this
was
written
at
a
time
when
the
black
limber
bone
of
the
greenland
or
right
whale
was
largely
used
in
ladies’
bodices
but
this
same
bone
is
not
in
the
tail
it
is
in
the
head
which
is
a
sad
mistake
for
a
sagacious
lawyer
like
prynne
but
is
the
queen
a
mermaid
to
be
presented
with
a
tail
an
allegorical
meaning
may
lurk
here
there
are
two
royal
fish
so
styled
by
the
english
law
writers—the
whale
and
the
sturgeon
both
royal
property
under
certain
limitations
and
nominally
supplying
the
tenth
branch
of
the
crown’s
ordinary
revenue
i
know
not
that
any
other
author
has
hinted
of
the
matter
but
by
inference
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sturgeon
must
be
divided
in
the
same
way
as
the
whale
the
king
receiving
the
highly
dense
and
elastic
head
peculiar
to
that
fish
which
symbolically
regarded
may
possibly
be
humorously
grounded
upon
some
presumed
congeniality
and
thus
there
seems
a
reason
in
all
things
even
in
law
chapter
91
the
pequod
meets
the
rose-bud
“in
vain
it
was
to

paunch
of

leviathan
insufferable
fetor
denying
not
inquiry.”
_sir
t
browne
v.e._
it
was
a
week
or
two
after
the
last
whaling
scene
recounted
and
when
we
were
slowly
sailing
over
a
sleepy
vapory
mid-day
sea
that
the
many
noses
on
the
pequod’s
deck
proved
more
vigilant
discoverers
than
the
three
pairs
of
eyes
aloft
a
peculiar
and
not
very
pleasant
smell
was
smelt
in
the
sea
“i
will
bet
something
now,”
said
stubb
“that
somewhere
hereabouts
are
some
of
those
drugged
whales
we
tickled
the
other
day
i
thought
they
would
keel
up
before
long.”
presently
the
vapors
in
advance
slid
aside
and
there
in
the
distance
lay
a
ship
whose
furled
sails
betokened
that
some
sort
of
whale
must
be
alongside
as
we
glided
nearer
the
stranger
showed
french
colours
from
his
peak
and
by
the
eddying
cloud
of
vulture
sea-fowl
that
circled
and
hovered
and
swooped
around
him
it
was
plain
that
the
whale
alongside
must
be
what
the
fishermen
call
a
blasted
whale
that
is
a
whale
that
has
died
unmolested
on
the
sea
and
so
floated
an
unappropriated
corpse
it
may
well
be
conceived
what
an
unsavory
odor
such
a
mass
must
exhale
worse
than
an
assyrian
city
in
the
plague
when
the
living
are
incompetent
to
bury
the
departed
so
intolerable
indeed
is
it
regarded
by
some
that
no
cupidity
could
persuade
them
to
moor
alongside
of
it
yet
are
there
those
who
will
still
do
it
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
oil
obtained
from
such
subjects
is
of
a
very
inferior
quality
and
by
no
means
of
the
nature
of
attar-of-rose
coming
still
nearer
with
the
expiring
breeze
we
saw
that
the
frenchman
had
a
second
whale
alongside
and
this
second
whale
seemed
even
more
of
a
nosegay
than
the
first
in
truth
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
those
problematical
whales
that
seem
to
dry
up
and
die
with
a
sort
of
prodigious
dyspepsia
or
indigestion
leaving
their
defunct
bodies
almost
entirely
bankrupt
of
anything
like
oil
nevertheless
in
the
proper
place
we
shall
see
that
no
knowing
fisherman
will
ever
turn
up
his
nose
at
such
a
whale
as
this
however
much
he
may
shun
blasted
whales
in
general
the
pequod
had
now
swept
so
nigh
to
the
stranger
that
stubb
vowed
he
recognised
his
cutting
spade-pole
entangled
in
the
lines
that
were
knotted
round
the
tail
of
one
of
these
whales
“there’s
a
pretty
fellow
now,”
he
banteringly
laughed
standing
in
the
ship’s
bows
“there’s
a
jackal
for
ye
i
well
know
that
these
crappoes
of
frenchmen
are
but
poor
devils
in
the
fishery
sometimes
lowering
their
boats
for
breakers
mistaking
them
for
sperm
whale
spouts
yes
and
sometimes
sailing
from
their
port
with
their
hold
full
of
boxes
of
tallow
candles
and
cases
of
snuffers
foreseeing
that
all
the
oil
they
will
get
won’t
be
enough
to
dip
the
captain’s
wick
into
aye
we
all
know
these
things
but
look
ye
here’s
a
crappo
that
is
content

leavings

i

other
precious

has
there
poor

i

pass
round
a
hat
some
one

let’s
make
him
a
present
of
a
little
oil

dear
charity’s
sake

what

he’ll
get

no
not
in
a
condemned
cell
and
as
for
the
other
whale
why
i’ll
agree
to
get
more
oil
by
chopping
up
and
trying
out
these
three
masts
of
ours
than
he’ll
get
from
that
bundle
of
bones
though
now
that
i
think
of
it
it
may
contain
something
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
oil
yes
ambergris
i
wonder
now
if
our
old
man
has
thought
of
that
it’s
worth
trying
yes
i’m
for
it;”
and
so
saying
he
started
for
the
quarter-deck
by
this
time
the
faint
air
had
become
a
complete
calm
so
that
whether
or
no
the
pequod
was
now
fairly
entrapped
in
the
smell
with
no
hope
of
escaping
except
by
its
breezing
up
again
issuing
from
the
cabin
stubb
now
called
his
boat’s
crew
and
pulled
off
for
the
stranger
drawing
across
her
bow
he
perceived
that
in
accordance
with
the
fanciful
french
taste
the
upper
part
of
her
stem-piece
was
carved
in
the
likeness
of
a
huge
drooping
stalk
was
painted
green
and
for
thorns
had
copper
spikes
projecting
from
it
here
and
there
the
whole
terminating
in
a
symmetrical
folded
bulb
of
a
bright
red
colour
upon
her
head
boards
in
large
gilt
letters
he
read
“bouton
de
rose,”—rose-button
or
rose-bud
and
this
was
the
romantic
name
of
this
aromatic
ship
though
stubb
did
not
understand
the
_bouton_
part
of
the
inscription
yet
the
word
_rose_
and
the
bulbous
figure-head
put
together
sufficiently
explained
the
whole
to
him
“a
wooden
rose-bud
eh?”
he
cried
with
his
hand
to
his
nose
“that
will
do
very
well
but
how
like
all
creation
it
smells!”
now
in
order
to
hold
direct
communication
with
the
people
on
deck
he
had
to
pull
round
the
bows
to
the
starboard
side
and
thus
come
close
to
the
blasted
whale
and
so
talk
over
it
arrived
then
at
this
spot
with
one
hand
still
to
his
nose
he
bawled—“bouton-de-rose
ahoy
are
there
any
of
you
bouton-de-roses
that
speak
english?”
“yes,”
rejoined
a
guernsey-man
from
the
bulwarks
who
turned
out
to
be
the
chief-mate
“well
then
my
bouton-de-rose-bud
have
you
seen
the
white
whale?”
“_what_
whale?”
“the
_white_
whale—a
sperm
whale—moby
dick
have
ye
seen
him
“never
heard
of
such
a
whale
cachalot
blanche
white
whale—no.”
“very
good
then
good
bye
now
and
i’ll
call
again
in
a
minute.”
then
rapidly
pulling
back
towards
the
pequod
and
seeing
ahab
leaning
over
the
quarter-deck
rail
awaiting
his
report
he
moulded
his
two
hands
into
a
trumpet
and
shouted—“no
sir
no!”
upon
which
ahab
retired
and
stubb
returned
to
the
frenchman
he
now
perceived
that
the
guernsey-man
who
had
just
got
into
the
chains
and
was
using
a
cutting-spade
had
slung
his
nose
in
a
sort
of
bag
“what’s
the
matter
with
your
nose
there?”
said
stubb
“broke
it?”
“i
wish
it
was
broken
or
that
i
didn’t
have
any
nose
at
all!”
answered
the
guernsey-man
who
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
job
he
was
at
very
much
“but
what
are
you
holding
_yours_
for?”
“oh
nothing
it’s
a
wax
nose
i
have
to
hold
it
on
fine
day
ain’t
it
air
rather
gardenny
i
should
say
throw
us
a
bunch
of
posies
will
ye
bouton-de-rose?”
“what
in
the
devil’s
name
do
you
want
here?”
roared
the
guernseyman
flying
into
a
sudden
passion
“oh
keep
cool—cool
yes
that’s
the
word
why
don’t
you
pack
those
whales
in
ice
while
you’re
working
at
’em
but
joking
aside
though
do
you
know
rose-bud
that
it’s
all
nonsense
trying
to
get
any
oil
out
of
such
whales
as
for
that
dried
up
one
there
he
hasn’t
a
gill
in
his
whole
carcase.”
“i
know
that
well
enough
but
d’ye
see
the
captain
here
won’t
believe
it
this
is
his
first
voyage
he
was
a
cologne
manufacturer
before
but
come
aboard
and
mayhap
he’ll
believe
you
if
he
won’t
me
and
so
i’ll
get
out
of
this
dirty
scrape.”
“anything
to
oblige
ye
my
sweet
and
pleasant
fellow,”
rejoined
stubb
and
with
that
he
soon
mounted
to
the
deck
there
a
queer
scene
presented
itself
the
sailors
in
tasselled
caps
of
red
worsted
were
getting
the
heavy
tackles
in
readiness
for
the
whales
but
they
worked
rather
slow
and
talked
very
fast
and
seemed
in
anything
but
a
good
humor
all
their
noses
upwardly
projected
from
their
faces
like
so
many
jib-booms
now
and
then
pairs
of
them
would
drop
their
work
and
run
up
to
the
mast-head
to
get
some
fresh
air
some
thinking
they
would
catch
the
plague
dipped
oakum
in
coal-tar
and
at
intervals
held
it
to
their
nostrils
others
having
broken
the
stems
of
their
pipes
almost
short
off
at
the
bowl
were
vigorously
puffing
tobacco-smoke
so
that
it
constantly
filled
their
olfactories
stubb
was
struck
by
a
shower
of
outcries
and
anathemas
proceeding
from
the
captain’s
round-house
abaft
and
looking
in
that
direction
saw
a
fiery
face
thrust
from
behind
the
door
which
was
held
ajar
from
within
this
was
the
tormented
surgeon
who
after
in
vain
remonstrating
against
the
proceedings
of
the
day
had
betaken
himself
to
the
captain’s
round-house
_cabinet_
he
called
it
to
avoid
the
pest
but
still
could
not
help
yelling
out
his
entreaties
and
indignations
at
times
marking
all
this
stubb
argued
well
for
his
scheme
and
turning
to
the
guernsey-man
had
a
little
chat
with
him
during
which
the
stranger
mate
expressed
his
detestation
of
his
captain
as
a
conceited
ignoramus
who
had
brought
them
all
into
so
unsavory
and
unprofitable
a
pickle
sounding
him
carefully
stubb
further
perceived
that
the
guernsey-man
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
concerning
the
ambergris
he
therefore
held
his
peace
on
that
head
but
otherwise
was
quite
frank
and
confidential
with
him
so
that
the
two
quickly
concocted
a
little
plan
for
both
circumventing
and
satirizing
the
captain
without
his
at
all
dreaming
of
distrusting
their
sincerity
according
to
this
little
plan
of
theirs
the
guernsey-man
under
cover
of
an
interpreter’s
office
was
to
tell
the
captain
what
he
pleased
but
as
coming
from
stubb
and
as
for
stubb
he
was
to
utter
any
nonsense
that
should
come
uppermost
in
him
during
the
interview
by
this
time
their
destined
victim
appeared
from
his
cabin
he
was
a
small
and
dark
but
rather
delicate
looking
man
for
a
sea-captain
with
large
whiskers
and
moustache
however
and
wore
a
red
cotton
velvet
vest
with
watch-seals
at
his
side
to
this
gentleman
stubb
was
now
politely
introduced
by
the
guernsey-man
who
at
once
ostentatiously
put
on
the
aspect
of
interpreting
between
them
“what
shall
i
say
to
him
first?”
said
he
“why,”
said
stubb
eyeing
the
velvet
vest
and
the
watch
and
seals
“you
may
as
well
begin
by
telling
him
that
he
looks
a
sort
of
babyish
to
me
though
i
don’t
pretend
to
be
a
judge.”
“he
says
monsieur,”
said
the
guernsey-man
in
french
turning
to
his
captain
“that
only
yesterday
his
ship
spoke
a
vessel
whose
captain
and
chief-mate
with
six
sailors
had
all
died
of
a
fever
caught
from
a
blasted
whale
they
had
brought
alongside.”
upon
this
the
captain
started
and
eagerly
desired
to
know
more
“what
now?”
said
the
guernsey-man
to
stubb
“why
since
he
takes
it
so
easy
tell
him
that
now
i
have
eyed
him
carefully
i’m
quite
certain
that
he’s
no
more
fit
to
command
a
whale-ship
than
a
st
jago
monkey
in
fact
tell
him
from
me
he’s
a
baboon.”
“he
vows
and
declares
monsieur
that
the
other
whale
the
dried
one
is
far
more
deadly
than
the
blasted
one
in
fine
monsieur
he
conjures
us
as
we
value
our
lives
to
cut
loose
from
these
fish.”
instantly
the
captain
ran
forward
and
in
a
loud
voice
commanded
his
crew
to
desist
from
hoisting
the
cutting-tackles
and
at
once
cast
loose
the
cables
and
chains
confining
the
whales
to
the
ship
“what
now?”
said
the
guernsey-man
when
the
captain
had
returned
to
them
“why
let
me
see
yes
you
may
as
well
tell
him
now
that—that—in
fact
tell
him
i’ve
diddled
him
and
aside
to
himself
perhaps
somebody
else.”
“he
says
monsieur
that
he’s
very
happy
to
have
been
of
any
service
to
us.”
hearing
this
the
captain
vowed
that
they
were
the
grateful
parties
meaning
himself
and
mate
and
concluded
by
inviting
stubb
down
into
his
cabin
to
drink
a
bottle
of
bordeaux
“he
wants
you
to
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
him,”
said
the
interpreter
“thank
him
heartily
but
tell
him
it’s
against
my
principles
to
drink
with
the
man
i’ve
diddled
in
fact
tell
him
i
must
go.”
“he
says
monsieur
that
his
principles
won’t
admit
of
his
drinking
but
that
if
monsieur
wants
to
live
another
day
to
drink
then
monsieur
had
best
drop
all
four
boats
and
pull
the
ship
away
from
these
whales
for
it’s
so
calm
they
won’t
drift.”
by
this
time
stubb
was
over
the
side
and
getting
into
his
boat
hailed
the
guernsey-man
to
this
effect,—that
having
a
long
tow-line
in
his
boat
he
would
do
what
he
could
to
help
them
by
pulling
out
the
lighter
whale
of
the
two
from
the
ship’s
side
while
the
frenchman’s
boats
then
were
engaged
in
towing
the
ship
one
way
stubb
benevolently
towed
away
at
his
whale
the
other
way
ostentatiously
slacking
out
a
most
unusually
long
tow-line
presently
a
breeze
sprang
up
stubb
feigned
to
cast
off
from
the
whale
hoisting
his
boats
the
frenchman
soon
increased
his
distance
while
the
pequod
slid
in
between
him
and
stubb’s
whale
whereupon
stubb
quickly
pulled
to
the
floating
body
and
hailing
the
pequod
to
give
notice
of
his
intentions
at
once
proceeded
to
reap
the
fruit
of
his
unrighteous
cunning
seizing
his
sharp
boat-spade
he
commenced
an
excavation
in
the
body
a
little
behind
the
side
fin
you
would
almost
have
thought
he
was
digging
a
cellar
there
in
the
sea
and
when
at
length
his
spade
struck
against
the
gaunt
ribs
it
was
like
turning
up
old
roman
tiles
and
pottery
buried
in
fat
english
loam
his
boat’s
crew
were
all
in
high
excitement
eagerly
helping
their
chief
and
looking
as
anxious
as
gold-hunters
and
all
the
time
numberless
fowls
were
diving
and
ducking
and
screaming
and
yelling
and
fighting
around
them
stubb
was
beginning
to
look
disappointed
especially
as
the
horrible
nosegay
increased
when
suddenly
from
out
the
very
heart
of
this
plague
there
stole
a
faint
stream
of
perfume
which
flowed
through
the
tide
of
bad
smells
without
being
absorbed
by
it
as
one
river
will
flow
into
and
then
along
with
another
without
at
all
blending
with
it
for
a
time
“i
have
it
i
have
it,”
cried
stubb
with
delight
striking
something
in
the
subterranean
regions
“a
purse
a
purse!”
dropping
his
spade
he
thrust
both
hands
in
and
drew
out
handfuls
of
something
that
looked
like
ripe
windsor
soap
or
rich
mottled
old
cheese
very
unctuous
and
savory
withal
you
might
easily
dent
it
with
your
thumb
it
is
of
a
hue
between
yellow
and
ash
colour
and
this
good
friends
is
ambergris
worth
a
gold
guinea
an
ounce
to
any
druggist
some
six
handfuls
were
obtained
but
more
was
unavoidably
lost
in
the
sea
and
still
more
perhaps
might
have
been
secured
were
it
not
for
impatient
ahab’s
loud
command
to
stubb
to
desist
and
come
on
board
else
the
ship
would
bid
them
good
bye
chapter
92
ambergris
now
this
ambergris
is
a
very
curious
substance
and
so
important
as
an
article
of
commerce
that
in
1791
a
certain
nantucket-born
captain
coffin
was
examined
at
the
bar
of
the
english
house
of
commons
on
that
subject
for
at
that
time
and
indeed
until
a
comparatively
late
day
the
precise
origin
of
ambergris
remained
like
amber
itself
a
problem
to
the
learned
though
the
word
ambergris
is
but
the
french
compound
for
grey
amber
yet
the
two
substances
are
quite
distinct
for
amber
though
at
times
found
on
the
sea-coast
is
also
dug
up
in
some
far
inland
soils
whereas
ambergris
is
never
found
except
upon
the
sea
besides
amber
is
a
hard
transparent
brittle
odorless
substance
used
for
mouth-pieces
to
pipes
for
beads
and
ornaments
but
ambergris
is
soft
waxy
and
so
highly
fragrant
and
spicy
that
it
is
largely
used
in
perfumery
in
pastiles
precious
candles
hair-powders
and
pomatum
the
turks
use
it
in
cooking
and
also
carry
it
to
mecca
for
the
same
purpose
that
frankincense
is
carried
to
st
peter’s
in
rome
some
wine
merchants
drop
a
few
grains
into
claret
to
flavor
it
who
would
think
then
that
such
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
should
regale
themselves
with
an
essence
found
in
the
inglorious
bowels
of
a
sick
whale
yet
so
it
is
by
some
ambergris
is
supposed
to
be
the
cause
and
by
others
the
effect
of
the
dyspepsia
in
the
whale
how
to
cure
such
a
dyspepsia
it
were
hard
to
say
unless
by
administering
three
or
four
boat
loads
of
brandreth’s
pills
and
then
running
out
of
harm’s
way
as
laborers
do
in
blasting
rocks
i
have
forgotten
to
say
that
there
were
found
in
this
ambergris
certain
hard
round
bony
plates
which
at
first
stubb
thought
might
be
sailors’
trowsers
buttons
but
it
afterwards
turned
out
that
they
were
nothing
more
than
pieces
of
small
squid
bones
embalmed
in
that
manner
now
that
the
incorruption
of
this
most
fragrant
ambergris
should
be
found
in
the
heart
of
such
decay
is
this
nothing
bethink
thee
of
that
saying
of
st
paul
in
corinthians
about
corruption
and
incorruption
how
that
we
are
sown
in
dishonor
but
raised
in
glory
and
likewise
call
to
mind
that
saying
of
paracelsus
about
what
it
is
that
maketh
the
best
musk
also
forget
not
the
strange
fact
that
of
all
things
of
ill-savor
cologne-water
in
its
rudimental
manufacturing
stages
is
the
worst
i
should
like
to
conclude
the
chapter
with
the
above
appeal
but
cannot
owing
to
my
anxiety
to
repel
a
charge
often
made
against
whalemen
and
which
in
the
estimation
of
some
already
biased
minds
might
be
considered
as
indirectly
substantiated
by
what
has
been
said
of
the
frenchman’s
two
whales
elsewhere
in
this
volume
the
slanderous
aspersion
has
been
disproved
that
the
vocation
of
whaling
is
throughout
a
slatternly
untidy
business
but
there
is
another
thing
to
rebut
they
hint
that
all
whales
always
smell
bad
now
how
did
this
odious
stigma
originate
i
opine
that
it
is
plainly
traceable
to
the
first
arrival
of
the
greenland
whaling
ships
in
london
more
than
two
centuries
ago
because
those
whalemen
did
not
then
and
do
not
now
try
out
their
oil
at
sea
as
the
southern
ships
have
always
done
but
cutting
up
the
fresh
blubber
in
small
bits
thrust
it
through
the
bung
holes
of
large
casks
and
carry
it
home
in
that
manner
the
shortness
of
the
season
in
those
icy
seas
and
the
sudden
and
violent
storms
to
which
they
are
exposed
forbidding
any
other
course
the
consequence
is
that
upon
breaking
into
the
hold
and
unloading
one
of
these
whale
cemeteries
in
the
greenland
dock
a
savor
is
given
forth
somewhat
similar
to
that
arising
from
excavating
an
old
city
grave-yard
for
the
foundations
of
a
lying-in
hospital
i
partly
surmise
also
that
this
wicked
charge
against
whalers
may
be
likewise
imputed
to
the
existence
on
the
coast
of
greenland
in
former
times
of
a
dutch
village
called
schmerenburgh
or
smeerenberg
which
latter
name
is
the
one
used
by
the
learned
fogo
von
slack
in
his
great
work
on
smells
a
text-book
on
that
subject
as
its
name
imports
smeer
fat
berg
to
put
up
this
village
was
founded
in
order
to
afford
a
place
for
the
blubber
of
the
dutch
whale
fleet
to
be
tried
out
without
being
taken
home
to
holland
for
that
purpose
it
was
a
collection
of
furnaces
fat-kettles
and
oil
sheds
and
when
the
works
were
in
full
operation
certainly
gave
forth
no
very
pleasant
savor
but
all
this
is
quite
different
with
a
south
sea
sperm
whaler
which
in
a
voyage
of
four
years
perhaps
after
completely
filling
her
hold
with
oil
does
not
perhaps
consume
fifty
days
in
the
business
of
boiling
out
and
in
the
state
that
it
is
casked
the
oil
is
nearly
scentless
the
truth
is
that
living
or
dead
if
but
decently
treated
whales
as
a
species
are
by
no
means
creatures
of
ill
odor
nor
can
whalemen
be
recognised
as
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
affected
to
detect
a
jew
in
the
company
by
the
nose
nor
indeed
can
the
whale
possibly
be
otherwise
than
fragrant
when
as
a
general
thing
he
enjoys
such
high
health
taking
abundance
of
exercise
always
out
of
doors
though
it
is
true
seldom
in
the
open
air
i
say
that
the
motion
of
a
sperm
whale’s
flukes
above
water
dispenses
a
perfume
as
when
a
musk-scented
lady
rustles
her
dress
in
a
warm
parlor
what
then
shall
i
liken
the
sperm
whale
to
for
fragrance
considering
his
magnitude
must
it
not
be
to
that
famous
elephant
with
jewelled
tusks
and
redolent
with
myrrh
which
was
led
out
of
an
indian
town
to
do
honor
to
alexander

93
the
castaway
it
was
but
some
few
days
after
encountering
the
frenchman
that
a
most
significant
event
befell
the
most
insignificant
of
the
pequod’s
crew
an
event
most
lamentable
and
which
ended
in
providing
the
sometimes
madly
merry
and
predestinated
craft
with
a
living
and
ever
accompanying
prophecy
of
whatever
shattered
sequel
might
prove
her
own
now
in
the
whale
ship
it
is
not
every
one
that
goes
in
the
boats
some
few
hands
are
reserved
called
ship-keepers
whose
province
it
is
to
work
the
vessel
while
the
boats
are
pursuing
the
whale
as
a
general
thing
these
ship-keepers
are
as
hardy
fellows
as
the
men
comprising
the
boats’
crews
but
if
there
happen
to
be
an
unduly
slender
clumsy
or
timorous
wight
in
the
ship
that
wight
is
certain
to
be
made
a
ship-keeper
it
was
so
in
the
pequod
with
the
little
negro
pippin
by
nick-name
pip
by
abbreviation
poor
pip
ye
have
heard
of
him
before
ye
must
remember
his
tambourine
on
that
dramatic
midnight
so
gloomy-jolly
in
outer
aspect
pip
and
dough-boy
made
a
match
like
a
black
pony
and
a
white
one
of
equal
developments
though
of
dissimilar
colour
driven
in
one
eccentric
span
but
while
hapless
dough-boy
was
by
nature
dull
and
torpid
in
his
intellects
pip
though
over
tender-hearted
was
at
bottom
very
bright
with
that
pleasant
genial
jolly
brightness
peculiar
to
his
tribe
a
tribe
which
ever
enjoy
all
holidays
and
festivities
with
finer
freer
relish
than
any
other
race
for
blacks
the
year’s
calendar
should
show
naught
but
three
hundred
and
sixty-five
fourth
of
julys
and
new
year’s
days
nor
smile
so
while
i
write
that
this
little
black
was
brilliant
for
even
blackness
has
its
brilliancy
behold
yon
lustrous
ebony
panelled
in
king’s
cabinets
but
pip
loved
life
and
all
life’s
peaceable
securities
so
that
the
panic-striking
business
in
which
he
had
somehow
unaccountably
become
entrapped
had
most
sadly
blurred
his
brightness
though
as
ere
long
will
be
seen
what
was
thus
temporarily
subdued
in
him
in
the
end
was
destined
to
be
luridly
illumined
by
strange
wild
fires
that
fictitiously
showed
him
off
to
ten
times
the
natural
lustre
with
which
in
his
native
tolland
county
in
connecticut
he
had
once
enlivened
many
a
fiddler’s
frolic
on
the
green
and
at
melodious
even-tide
with
his
gay
ha-ha
had
turned
the
round
horizon
into
one
star-belled
tambourine
so
though
in
the
clear
air
of
day
suspended
against
a
blue-veined
neck
the
pure-watered
diamond
drop
will
healthful
glow
yet
when
the
cunning
jeweller
would
show
you
the
diamond
in
its
most
impressive
lustre
he
lays
it
against
a
gloomy
ground
and
then
lights
it
up
not
by
the
sun
but
by
some
unnatural
gases
then
come
out
those
fiery
effulgences
infernally
superb
then
the
evil-blazing
diamond
once
the
divinest
symbol
of
the
crystal
skies
looks
like
some
crown-jewel
stolen
from
the
king
of
hell
but
let
us
to
the
story
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
ambergris
affair
stubb’s
after-oarsman
chanced
so
to
sprain
his
hand
as
for
a
time
to
become
quite
maimed
and
temporarily
pip
was
put
into
his
place
the
first
time
stubb
lowered
with
him
pip
evinced
much
nervousness
but
happily
for
that
time
escaped
close
contact
with
the
whale
and
therefore
came
off
not
altogether
discreditably
though
stubb
observing
him
took
care
afterwards
to
exhort
him
to
cherish
his
courageousness
to
the
utmost
for
he
might
often
find
it
needful
now
upon
the
second
lowering
the
boat
paddled
upon
the
whale
and
as
the
fish
received
the
darted
iron
it
gave
its
customary
rap
which
happened
in
this
instance
to
be
right
under
poor
pip’s
seat
the
involuntary
consternation
of
the
moment
caused
him
to
leap
paddle
in
hand
out
of
the
boat
and
in
such
a
way
that
part
of
the
slack
whale
line
coming
against
his
chest
he
breasted
it
overboard
with
him
so
as
to
become
entangled
in
it
when
at
last
plumping
into
the
water
that
instant
the
stricken
whale
started
on
a
fierce
run
the
line
swiftly
straightened
and
presto
poor
pip
came
all
foaming
up
to
the
chocks
of
the
boat
remorselessly
dragged
there
by
the
line
which
had
taken
several
turns
around
his
chest
and
neck
tashtego
stood
in
the
bows
he
was
full
of
the
fire
of
the
hunt
he
hated
pip
for
a
poltroon
snatching
the
boat-knife
from
its
sheath
he
suspended
its
sharp
edge
over
the
line
and
turning
towards
stubb
exclaimed
interrogatively
“cut?”
meantime
pip’s
blue
choked
face
plainly
looked
do
for
god’s
sake
all
passed
in
a
flash
in
less
than
half
a
minute
this
entire
thing
happened
“damn
him
cut!”
roared
stubb
and
so
the
whale
was
lost
and
pip
was
saved
so
soon
as
he
recovered
himself
the
poor
little
negro
was
assailed
by
yells
and
execrations
from
the
crew
tranquilly
permitting
these
irregular
cursings
to
evaporate
stubb
then
in
a
plain
business-like
but
still
half
humorous
manner
cursed
pip
officially
and
that
done
unofficially
gave
him
much
wholesome
advice
the
substance
was
never
jump
from
a
boat
pip
except—but
all
the
rest
was
indefinite
as
the
soundest
advice
ever
is
now
in
general
_stick
to
the
boat_
is
your
true
motto
in
whaling
but
cases
will
sometimes
happen
when
_leap
from
the
boat_
is
still
better
moreover
as
if
perceiving
at
last
that
if
he
should
give
undiluted
conscientious
advice
to
pip
he
would
be
leaving
him
too
wide
a
margin
to
jump
in
for
the
future
stubb
suddenly
dropped
all
advice
and
concluded
with
a
peremptory
command
“stick
to
the
boat
pip
or
by
the
lord
i
won’t
pick
you
up
if
you
jump
mind
that
we
can’t
afford
to
lose
whales
by
the
likes
of
you
a
whale
would
sell
for
thirty
times
what
you
would
pip
in
alabama
bear
that
in
mind
and
don’t
jump
any
more.”
hereby
perhaps
stubb
indirectly
hinted
that
though
man
loved
his
fellow
yet
man
is
a
money-making
animal
which
propensity
too
often
interferes
with
his
benevolence
but
we
are
all
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
and
pip
jumped
again
it
was
under
very
similar
circumstances
to
the
first
performance
but
this
time
he
did
not
breast
out
the
line
and
hence
when
the
whale
started
to
run
pip
was
left
behind
on
the
sea
like
a
hurried
traveller’s
trunk
alas
stubb
was
but
too
true
to
his
word
it
was
a
beautiful
bounteous
blue
day
the
spangled
sea
calm
and
cool
and
flatly
stretching
away
all
round
to
the
horizon
like
gold-beater’s
skin
hammered
out
to
the
extremest
bobbing
up
and
down
in
that
sea
pip’s
ebon
head
showed
like
a
head
of
cloves
no
boat-knife
was
lifted
when
he
fell
so
rapidly
astern
stubb’s
inexorable
back
was
turned
upon
him
and
the
whale
was
winged
in
three
minutes
a
whole
mile
of
shoreless
ocean
was
between
pip
and
stubb
out
from
the
centre
of
the
sea
poor
pip
turned
his
crisp
curling
black
head
to
the
sun
another
lonely
castaway
though
the
loftiest
and
the
brightest
now
in
calm
weather
to
swim
in
the
open
ocean
is
as
easy
to
the
practised
swimmer
as
to
ride
in
a
spring-carriage
ashore
but
the
awful
lonesomeness
is
intolerable
the
intense
concentration
of
self
in
the
middle
of
such
a
heartless
immensity
my
god
who
can
tell
it
mark
how
when
sailors
in
a
dead
calm
bathe
in
the
open
sea—mark
how
closely
they
hug
their
ship
and
only
coast
along
her
sides
but
had
stubb
really
abandoned
the
poor
little
negro
to
his
fate
no
he
did
not
mean
to
at
least
because
there
were
two
boats
in
his
wake
and
he
supposed
no
doubt
that
they
would
of
course
come
up
to
pip
very
quickly
and
pick
him
up
though
indeed
such
considerations
towards
oarsmen
jeopardized
through
their
own
timidity
is
not
always
manifested
by
the
hunters
in
all
similar
instances
and
such
instances
not
unfrequently
occur
almost
invariably
in
the
fishery
a
coward
so
called
is
marked
with
the
same
ruthless
detestation
peculiar
to
military
navies
and
armies
but
it
so
happened
that
those
boats
without
seeing
pip
suddenly
spying
whales
close
to
them
on
one
side
turned
and
gave
chase
and
stubb’s
boat
was
now
so
far
away
and
he
and
all
his
crew
so
intent
upon
his
fish
that
pip’s
ringed
horizon
began
to
expand
around
him
miserably
by
the
merest
chance
the
ship
itself
at
last
rescued
him
but
from
that
hour
the
little
negro
went
about
the
deck
an
idiot
such
at
least
they
said
he
was
the
sea
had
jeeringly
kept
his
finite
body
up
but
drowned
the
infinite
of
his
soul
not
drowned
entirely
though
rather
carried
down
alive
to
wondrous
depths
where
strange
shapes
of
the
unwarped
primal
world
glided
to
and
fro
before
his
passive
eyes
and
the
miser-merman
wisdom
revealed
his
hoarded
heaps
and
among
the
joyous
heartless
ever-juvenile
eternities
pip
saw
the
multitudinous
god-omnipresent
coral
insects
that
out
of
the
firmament
of
waters
heaved
the
colossal
orbs
he
saw
god’s
foot
upon
the
treadle
of
the
loom
and
spoke
it
and
therefore
his
shipmates
called
him
mad
so
man’s
insanity
is
heaven’s
sense
and
wandering
from
all
mortal
reason
man
comes
at
last
to
that
celestial
thought
which
to
reason
is
absurd
and
frantic
and
weal
or
woe
feels
then
uncompromised
indifferent
as
his
god
for
the
rest
blame
not
stubb
too
hardly
the
thing
is
common
in
that
fishery
and
in
the
sequel
of
the
narrative
it
will
then
be
seen
what
like
abandonment
befell
myself
chapter
94
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
that
whale
of
stubb’s
so
dearly
purchased
was
duly
brought
to
the
pequod’s
side
where
all
those
cutting
and
hoisting
operations
previously
detailed
were
regularly
gone
through
even
to
the
baling
of
the
heidelburgh
tun
or
case
while
some
were
occupied
with
this
latter
duty
others
were
employed
in
dragging
away
the
larger
tubs
so
soon
as
filled
with
the
sperm
and
when
the
proper
time
arrived
this
same
sperm
was
carefully
manipulated
ere
going
to
the
try-works
of
which
anon
it
had
cooled
and
crystallized
to
such
a
degree
that
when
with
several
others
i
sat
down
before
a
large
constantine’s
bath
of
it
i
found
it
strangely
concreted
into
lumps
here
and
there
rolling
about
in
the
liquid
part
it
was
our
business
to
squeeze
these
lumps
back
into
fluid
a
sweet
and
unctuous
duty
no
wonder
that
in
old
times
this
sperm
was
such
a
favourite
cosmetic
such
a
clearer
such
a
sweetener
such
a
softener
such
a
delicious
molifier
after
having
my
hands
in
it
for
only
a
few
minutes
my
fingers
felt
like
eels
and
began
as
it
were
to
serpentine
and
spiralise
as
i
sat
there
at
my
ease
cross-legged
on
the
deck
after
the
bitter
exertion
at
the
windlass
under
a
blue
tranquil
sky
the
ship
under
indolent
sail
and
gliding
so
serenely
along
as
i
bathed
my
hands
among
those
soft
gentle
globules
of
infiltrated
tissues
woven
almost
within
the
hour
as
they
richly
broke
to
my
fingers
and
discharged
all
their
opulence
like
fully
ripe
grapes
their
wine
as
i
snuffed
up
that
uncontaminated
aroma,—literally
and
truly
like
the
smell
of
spring
violets
i
declare
to
you
that
for
the
time
i
lived
as
in
a
musky
meadow
i
forgot
all
about
our
horrible
oath
in
that
inexpressible
sperm
i
washed
my
hands
and
my
heart
of
it
i
almost
began
to
credit
the
old
paracelsan
superstition
that
sperm
is
of
rare
virtue
in
allaying
the
heat
of
anger
while
bathing
in
that
bath
i
felt
divinely
free
from
all
ill-will
or
petulance
or
malice
of
any
sort
whatsoever
squeeze
squeeze
squeeze
all
the
morning
long
i
squeezed
that
sperm
till
i
myself
almost
melted
into
it
i
squeezed
that
sperm
till
a
strange
sort
of
insanity
came
over
me
and
i
found
myself
unwittingly
squeezing
my
co-laborers’
hands
in
it
mistaking
their
hands
for
the
gentle
globules
such
an
abounding
affectionate
friendly
loving
feeling
did
this
avocation
beget
that
at
last
i
was
continually
squeezing
their
hands
and
looking
up
into
their
eyes
sentimentally
as
much
as
to
say,—oh
my
dear
fellow
beings
why
should
we
longer
cherish
any
social
acerbities
or
know
the
slightest
ill-humor
or
envy
come
let
us
squeeze
hands
all
round
nay
let
us
all
squeeze
ourselves
into
each
other
let
us
squeeze
ourselves
universally
into
the
very
milk
and
sperm
of
kindness
would
that
i
could
keep
squeezing
that
sperm
for
ever
for
now
since
by
many
prolonged
repeated
experiences
i
have
perceived
that
in
all
cases
man
must
eventually
lower
or
at
least
shift
his
conceit
of
attainable
felicity
not
placing
it
anywhere
in
the
intellect
or
the
fancy
but
in
the
wife
the
heart
the
bed
the
table
the
saddle
the
fireside
the
country
now
that
i
have
perceived
all
this
i
am
ready
to
squeeze
case
eternally
in
thoughts
of
the
visions
of
the
night
i
saw
long
rows
of
angels
in
paradise
each
with
his
hands
in
a
jar
of
spermaceti
now
while
discoursing
of
sperm
it
behooves
to
speak
of
other
things
akin
to
it
in
the
business
of
preparing
the
sperm
whale
for
the
try-works
first
comes
white-horse
so
called
which
is
obtained
from
the
tapering
part
of
the
fish
and
also
from
the
thicker
portions
of
his
flukes
it
is
tough
with
congealed
tendons—a
wad
of
muscle—but
still
contains
some
oil
after
being
severed
from
the
whale
the
white-horse
is
first
cut
into
portable
oblongs
ere
going
to
the
mincer
they
look
much
like
blocks
of
berkshire
marble
plum-pudding
is
the
term
bestowed
upon
certain
fragmentary
parts
of
the
whale’s
flesh
here
and
there
adhering
to
the
blanket
of
blubber
and
often
participating
to
a
considerable
degree
in
its
unctuousness
it
is
a
most
refreshing
convivial
beautiful
object
to
behold
as
its
name
imports
it
is
of
an
exceedingly
rich
mottled
tint
with
a
bestreaked
snowy
and
golden
ground
dotted
with
spots
of
the
deepest
crimson
and
purple
it
is
plums
of
rubies
in
pictures
of
citron
spite
of
reason
it
is
hard
to
keep
yourself
from
eating
it
i
confess
that
once
i
stole
behind
the
foremast
to
try
it
it
tasted
something
as
i
should
conceive
a
royal
cutlet
from
the
thigh
of
louis
le
gros
might
have
tasted
supposing
him
to
have
been
killed
the
first
day
after
the
venison
season
and
that
particular
venison
season
contemporary
with
an
unusually
fine
vintage
of
the
vineyards
of
champagne
there
is
another
substance
and
a
very
singular
one
which
turns
up
in
the
course
of
this
business
but
which
i
feel
it
to
be
very
puzzling
adequately
to
describe
it
is
called
slobgollion
an
appellation
original
with
the
whalemen
and
even
so
is
the
nature
of
the
substance
it
is
an
ineffably
oozy
stringy
affair
most
frequently
found
in
the
tubs
of
sperm
after
a
prolonged
squeezing
and
subsequent
decanting
i
hold
it
to
be
the
wondrously
thin
ruptured
membranes
of
the
case
coalescing
gurry
so
called
is
a
term
properly
belonging
to
right
whalemen
but
sometimes
incidentally
used
by
the
sperm
fishermen
it
designates
the
dark
glutinous
substance
which
is
scraped
off
the
back
of
the
greenland
or
right
whale
and
much
of
which
covers
the
decks
of
those
inferior
souls
who
hunt
that
ignoble
leviathan
nippers
strictly
this
word
is
not
indigenous
to
the
whale’s
vocabulary
but
as
applied
by
whalemen
it
becomes
so
a
whaleman’s
nipper
is
a
short
firm
strip
of
tendinous
stuff
cut
from
the
tapering
part
of
leviathan’s
tail
it
averages
an
inch
in
thickness
and
for
the
rest
is
about
the
size
of
the
iron
part
of
a
hoe
edgewise
moved
along
the
oily
deck
it
operates
like
a
leathern
squilgee
and
by
nameless
blandishments
as
of
magic
allures
along
with
it
all
impurities
but
to
learn
all
about
these
recondite
matters
your
best
way
is
at
once
to
descend
into
the
blubber-room
and
have
a
long
talk
with
its
inmates
this
place
has
previously
been
mentioned
as
the
receptacle
for
the
blanket-pieces
when
stript
and
hoisted
from
the
whale
when
the
proper
time
arrives
for
cutting
up
its
contents
this
apartment
is
a
scene
of
terror
to
all
tyros
especially
by
night
on
one
side
lit
by
a
dull
lantern
a
space
has
been
left
clear
for
the
workmen
they
generally
go
in
pairs,—a
pike-and-gaffman
and
a
spade-man
the
whaling-pike
is
similar
to
a
frigate’s
boarding-weapon
of
the
same
name
the
gaff
is
something
like
a
boat-hook
with
his
gaff
the
gaffman
hooks
on
to
a
sheet
of
blubber
and
strives
to
hold
it
from
slipping
as
the
ship
pitches
and
lurches
about
meanwhile
the
spade-man
stands
on
the
sheet
itself
perpendicularly
chopping
it
into
the
portable
horse-pieces
this
spade
is
sharp
as
hone
can
make
it
the
spademan’s
feet
are
shoeless
the
thing
he
stands
on
will
sometimes
irresistibly
slide
away
from
him
like
a
sledge
if
he
cuts
off
one
of
his
own
toes
or
one
of
his
assistants’
would
you
be
very
much
astonished
toes
are
scarce
among
veteran
blubber-room
men

the

had
you
stepped
on
board
the
pequod
at
a
certain
juncture
of
this
post-mortemizing
of
the

and
had
you
strolled
forward
nigh
the
windlass
pretty
sure
am
i
that
you
would
have
scanned
with
no
small
curiosity
a
very
strange
enigmatical
object
which
you
would
have
seen
there
lying
along
lengthwise
in
the

not
the
wondrous
cistern
in
the

huge

not
the
prodigy
of
his
unhinged
lower
jaw
not
the
miracle
of
his
symmetrical

none
of
these
would
so
surprise
you
as
half
a
glimpse
of
that
unaccountable
cone,—longer
than

tall
nigh
a
foot
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
jet-black
as

the
ebony
idol
of

an
idol
indeed
it
is
or
rather
in
old
times
its

was
such
an
idol
as
that
found
in
the
secret
groves
of
queen
maachah
in
judea
and
for
worshipping
which
king
asa
her

depose

destroyed
the

the

the
mariners
call
it

with
bowed
shoulders
staggers
off
with
it
as
if
he
were
a
grenadier
carrying
a
dead
comrade
from
the
field
extending
it
upon
the
forecastle
deck
he
now
proceeds
cylindrically
to
remove
its
dark
pelt
as
an
african
hunter
the
pelt
of
a
boa
this
done
he
turns
the
pelt
inside
out
like
a
pantaloon
leg
gives
it
a
good
stretching
so
as
almost
to
double
its
diameter
and
at
last
hangs
it
well
spread
in
the
rigging
to
dry
ere
long
it
is
taken
down
when
removing
some
three
feet
of
it
towards
the
pointed
extremity
and
then
cutting
two
slits
for
arm-holes
at
the
other
end
he
lengthwise
slips
himself
bodily
into
it
the
mincer
now
stands
before
you
invested
in
the
full
canonicals
of
his
calling
immemorial
to
all
his
order
this
investiture
alone
will
adequately
protect
him
while
employed
in
the
peculiar
functions
of
his
office
that
office
consists
in
mincing
the
horse-pieces
of
blubber
for
the

an
operation
which
is
conducted
at
a
curious
wooden
horse
planted
endwise
against
the
bulwarks
and
with
a
capacious
tub
beneath
it
into
which
the
minced
pieces
drop
fast
as

the
invariable

to

him
to
be

as

the

besides
her

boats
an
american
whaler
is
outwardly
distinguished
by
her
try-works
she
presents
the
curious
anomaly
of
the
most
solid
masonry
joining
with
oak
and
hemp
in
constituting
the
completed
ship
it
is
as
if
from
the
open
field
a
brick-kiln
were
transported
to
her
planks
the
try-works
are
planted
between
the
foremast
and
mainmast
the
most
roomy
part
of
the
deck
the
timbers
beneath
are
of
a
peculiar
strength
fitted
to
sustain
the
weight
of
an
almost
solid
mass
of
brick
and
mortar
some
ten
feet
by
eight
square
and
five
in
height
the
foundation
does
not
penetrate
the
deck
but
the
masonry
is
firmly
secured
to
the
surface
by
ponderous
knees
of
iron
bracing
it
on
all
sides
and
screwing
it
down
to
the
timbers
on
the
flanks
it
is
cased
with
wood
and
at
top
completely
covered
by
a
large
sloping
battened
hatchway
removing
this
hatch
we
expose
the
great
try-pots
two
in
number
and
each
of
several
barrels’
capacity
when
not
in
use
they
are
kept
remarkably
clean
sometimes
they
are
polished
with
soapstone
and
sand
till
they
shine
within
like
silver
punch-bowls
during
the
night-watches
some
cynical
old
sailors
will
crawl
into
them
and
coil
themselves
away
there
for
a
nap
while
employed
in
polishing
them—one
man
in
each
pot
side
by
side—many
confidential
communications
are
carried
on
over
the
iron
lips
it
is
a
place
also
for
profound
mathematical
meditation
it
was
in
the
left
hand
try-pot
of
the
pequod
with
the
soapstone
diligently
circling
round
me
that
i
was
first
indirectly
struck
by
the
remarkable
fact
that
in
geometry
all
bodies
gliding
along
the
cycloid
my
soapstone
for
example
will
descend
from
any
point
in
precisely
the
same
time
removing
the
fire-board
from
the
front
of
the
try-works
the
bare
masonry
of
that
side
is
exposed
penetrated
by
the
two
iron
mouths
of
the
furnaces
directly
underneath
the
pots
these
mouths
are
fitted
with
heavy
doors
of
iron
the
intense
heat
of
the
fire
is
prevented
from
communicating
itself
to
the
deck
by
means
of
a
shallow
reservoir
extending
under
the
entire
inclosed
surface
of
the
works
by
a
tunnel
inserted
at
the
rear
this
reservoir
is
kept
replenished
with
water
as
fast
as
it
evaporates
there
are
no
external
chimneys
they
open
direct
from
the
rear
wall
and
here
let
us
go
back
for
a
moment
it
was
about
nine
o’clock
at
night
that
the
pequod’s
try-works
were
first
started
on
this
present
voyage
it
belonged
to
stubb
to
oversee
the
business
“all
ready
there
off
hatch
then
and
start
her
you
cook
fire
the
works.”
this
was
an
easy
thing
for
the
carpenter
had
been
thrusting
his
shavings
into
the
furnace
throughout
the
passage
here
be
it
said
that
in
a
whaling
voyage
the
first
fire
in
the
try-works
has
to
be
fed
for
a
time
with
wood
after
that
no
wood
is
used
except
as
a
means
of
quick
ignition
to
the
staple
fuel
in
a
word
after
being
tried
out
the
crisp
shrivelled
blubber
now
called
scraps
or
fritters
still
contains
considerable
of
its
unctuous
properties
these
fritters
feed
the
flames
like
a
plethoric
burning
martyr
or
a
self-consuming
misanthrope
once
ignited
the
whale
supplies
his
own
fuel
and
burns
by
his
own
body
would
that
he
consumed
his
own
smoke
for
his
smoke
is
horrible
to
inhale
and
inhale
it
you
must
and
not
only
that
but
you
must
live
in
it
for
the
time
it
has
an
unspeakable
wild
hindoo
odor
about
it
such
as
may
lurk
in
the
vicinity
of
funereal
pyres
it
smells
like
the
left
wing
of
the
day
of
judgment
it
is
an
argument
for
the
pit
by
midnight
the
works
were
in
full
operation
we
were
clear
from
the
carcase
sail
had
been
made
the
wind
was
freshening
the
wild
ocean
darkness
was
intense
but
that
darkness
was
licked
up
by
the
fierce
flames
which
at
intervals
forked
forth
from
the
sooty
flues
and
illuminated
every
lofty
rope
in
the
rigging
as
with
the
famed
greek
fire
the
burning
ship
drove
on
as
if
remorselessly
commissioned
to
some
vengeful
deed
so
the
pitch
and
sulphur-freighted
brigs
of
the
bold
hydriote
canaris
issuing
from
their
midnight
harbors
with
broad
sheets
of
flame
for
sails
bore
down
upon
the
turkish
frigates
and
folded
them
in
conflagrations
the
hatch
removed
from
the
top
of
the
works
now
afforded
a
wide
hearth
in
front
of
them
standing
on
this
were
the
tartarean
shapes
of
the
pagan
harpooneers
always
the
whale-ship’s
stokers
with
huge
pronged
poles
they
pitched
hissing
masses
of
blubber
into
the
scalding
pots
or
stirred
up
the
fires
beneath
till
the
snaky
flames
darted
curling
out
of
the
doors
to
catch
them
by
the
feet
the
smoke
rolled
away
in
sullen
heaps
to
every
pitch
of
the
ship
there
was
a
pitch
of
the
boiling
oil
which
seemed
all
eagerness
to
leap
into
their
faces
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
works
on
the
further
side
of
the
wide
wooden
hearth
was
the
windlass
this
served
for
a
sea-sofa
here
lounged
the
watch
when
not
otherwise
employed
looking
into
the
red
heat
of
the
fire
till
their
eyes
felt
scorched
in
their
heads
their
tawny
features
now
all
begrimed
with
smoke
and
sweat
their
matted
beards
and
the
contrasting
barbaric
brilliancy
of
their
teeth
all
these
were
strangely
revealed
in
the
capricious
emblazonings
of
the
works
as
they
narrated
to
each
other
their
unholy
adventures
their
tales
of
terror
told
in
words
of
mirth
as
their
uncivilized
laughter
forked
upwards
out
of
them
like
the
flames
from
the
furnace
as
to
and
fro
in
their
front
the
harpooneers
wildly
gesticulated
with
their
huge
pronged
forks
and
dippers
as
the
wind
howled
on
and
the
sea
leaped
and
the
ship
groaned
and
dived
and
yet
steadfastly
shot
her
red
hell
further
and
further
into
the
blackness
of
the
sea
and
the
night
and
scornfully
champed
the
white
bone
in
her
mouth
and
viciously
spat
round
her
on
all
sides
then
the
rushing
pequod
freighted
with
savages
and
laden
with
fire
and
burning
a
corpse
and
plunging
into
that
blackness
of
darkness
seemed
the
material
counterpart
of
her
monomaniac
commander’s
soul
so
seemed
it
to
me
as
i
stood
at
her
helm
and
for
long
hours
silently
guided
the
way
of
this
fire-ship
on
the
sea
wrapped
for
that
interval
in
darkness
myself
i
but
the
better
saw
the
redness
the
madness
the
ghastliness
of
others
the
continual
sight
of
the
fiend
shapes
before
me
capering
half
in
smoke
and
half
in
fire
these
at
last
begat
kindred
visions
in
my
soul
so
soon
as
i
began
to
yield
to
that
unaccountable
drowsiness
which
ever
would
come
over
me
at
a
midnight
helm
but
that
night
in
particular
a
strange
and
ever
since
inexplicable
thing
occurred
to
me
starting
from
a
brief
standing
sleep
i
was
horribly
conscious
of
something
fatally
wrong
the
jaw-bone
tiller
smote
my
side
which
leaned
against
it
in
my
ears
was
the
low
hum
of
sails
just
beginning
to
shake
in
the
wind
i
thought
my
eyes
were
open
i
was
half
conscious
of
putting
my
fingers
to
the
lids
and
mechanically
stretching
them
still
further
apart
but
spite
of
all
this
i
could
see
no
compass
before
me
to
steer
by
though
it
seemed
but
a
minute
since
i
had
been
watching
the
card
by
the
steady
binnacle
lamp
illuminating
it
nothing
seemed
before
me
but
a
jet
gloom
now
and
then
made
ghastly
by
flashes
of
redness
uppermost
was
the
impression
that
whatever
swift
rushing
thing
i
stood
on
was
not
so
much
bound
to
any
haven
ahead
as
rushing
from
all
havens
astern
a
stark
bewildered
feeling
as
of
death
came
over
me
convulsively
my
hands
grasped
the
tiller
but
with
the
crazy
conceit
that
the
tiller
was
somehow
in
some
enchanted
way
inverted
my
god
what
is
the
matter
with
me
thought
i
lo
in
my
brief
sleep
i
had
turned
myself
about
and
was
fronting
the
ship’s
stern
with
my
back
to
her
prow
and
the
compass
in
an
instant
i
faced
back
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
vessel
from
flying
up
into
the
wind
and
very
probably
capsizing
her
how
glad
and
how
grateful
the
relief
from
this
unnatural
hallucination
of
the
night
and
the
fatal
contingency
of
being
brought
by
the
lee
look
not
too
long
in
the
face
of
the
fire
o
man
never
dream
with
thy
hand
on
the
helm
turn
not
thy
back
to
the
compass
accept
the
first
hint
of
the
hitching
tiller
believe
not
the
artificial
fire
when
its
redness
makes
all
things
look
ghastly
to-morrow
in
the
natural
sun
the
skies
will
be
bright
those
who
glared
like
devils
in
the
forking
flames
the
morn
will
show
in
far
other
at
least
gentler
relief
the
glorious
golden
glad
sun
the
only
true
lamp—all
others
but
liars
nevertheless
the
sun
hides
not
virginia’s
dismal
swamp
nor
rome’s
accursed
campagna
nor
wide
sahara
nor
all
the
millions
of
miles
of
deserts
and
of
griefs
beneath
the
moon
the
sun
hides
not
the
ocean
which
is
the
dark
side
of
this
earth
and
which
is
two
thirds
of
this
earth
so
therefore
that
mortal
man
who
hath
more

stowing
down
and
clearing
up
already
has
it
been
related
how
the
great
leviathan
is
afar
off
descried
from
the
mast-head
how
he
is
chased
over
the
watery
moors
and
slaughtered
in
the
valleys
of
the
deep
how
he
is
then
towed
alongside
and
beheaded
and
how
on
the
principle
which
entitled
the
headsman
of
old
to
the
garments
in
which
the
beheaded
was
killed
his
great
padded
surtout
becomes
the
property
of
his
executioner
how
in
due
time
he
is
condemned
to
the
pots
and
like
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
his
spermaceti
oil
and
bone
pass
unscathed
through
the
fire;—but
now
it
remains
to
conclude
the
last
chapter
of
this
part
of
the
description
by
rehearsing—singing
if
i
may—the
romantic
proceeding
of
decanting
off
his
oil
into
the
casks
and
striking
them
down
into
the
hold
where
once
again
leviathan
returns
to
his
native
profundities
sliding
along
beneath
the
surface
as
before
but
alas
never
more
to
rise
and
blow
while
still
warm
the
oil
like
hot
punch
is
received
into
the
six-barrel
casks
and
while
perhaps
the
ship
is
pitching
and
rolling
this
way
and
that
in
the
midnight
sea
the
enormous
casks
are
slewed
round
and
headed
over
end
for
end
and
sometimes
perilously
scoot
across
the
slippery
deck
like
so
many
land
slides
till
at
last
man-handled
and
stayed
in
their
course
and
all
round
the
hoops
rap
rap
go
as
many
hammers
as
can
play
upon
them
for
now
_ex
officio_
every
sailor
is
a
cooper
at
length
when
the
last
pint
is
casked
and
all
is
cool
then
the
great
hatchways
are
unsealed
the
bowels
of
the
ship
are
thrown
open
and
down
go
the
casks
to
their
final
rest
in
the
sea
this
done
the
hatches
are
replaced
and
hermetically
closed
like
a
closet
walled
up
in
the
sperm
fishery
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
remarkable
incidents
in
all
the
business
of
whaling
one
day
the
planks
stream
with
freshets
of
blood
and
oil
on
the
sacred
quarter-deck
enormous
masses
of
the
whale’s
head
are
profanely
piled
great
rusty
casks
lie
about
as
in
a
brewery
yard
the
smoke
from
the
try-works
has
besooted
all
the
bulwarks
the
mariners
go
about
suffused
with
unctuousness
the
entire
ship
seems
great
leviathan
himself
while
on
all
hands
the
din
is
deafening
but
a
day
or
two
after
you
look
about
you
and
prick
your
ears
in
this
self-same
ship
and
were
it
not
for
the
tell-tale
boats
and
try-works
you
would
all
but
swear
you
trod
some
silent
merchant
vessel
with
a
most
scrupulously
neat
commander
the
unmanufactured
sperm
oil
possesses
a
singularly
cleansing
virtue
this
is
the
reason
why
the
decks
never
look
so
white
as
just
after
what
they
call
an
affair
of
oil
besides
from
the
ashes
of
the
burned
scraps
of
the
whale
a
potent
lye
is
readily
made
and
whenever
any
adhesiveness
from
the
back
of
the
whale
remains
clinging
to
the
side
that
lye
quickly
exterminates
it
hands
go
diligently
along
the
bulwarks
and
with
buckets
of
water
and
rags
restore
them
to
their
full
tidiness
the
soot
is
brushed
from
the
lower
rigging
all
the
numerous
implements
which
have
been
in
use
are
likewise
faithfully
cleansed
and
put
away
the
great
hatch
is
scrubbed
and
placed
upon
the
try-works
completely
hiding
the
pots
every
cask
is
out
of
sight
all
tackles
are
coiled
in
unseen
nooks
and
when
by
the
combined
and
simultaneous
industry
of
almost
the
entire
ship’s
company
the
whole
of
this
conscientious
duty
is
at
last
concluded
then
the
crew
themselves
proceed
to
their
own
ablutions
shift
themselves
from
top
to
toe
and
finally
issue
to
the
immaculate
deck
fresh
and
all
aglow
as
bridegrooms
new-leaped
from
out
the
daintiest
holland
now
with
elated
step
they
pace
the
planks
in
twos
and
threes
and
humorously
discourse
of
parlors
sofas
carpets
and
fine
cambrics
propose
to
mat
the
deck
think
of
having
hanging
to
the
top
object
not
to
taking
tea
by
moonlight
on
the
piazza
of
the
forecastle
to
hint
to
such
musked
mariners
of
oil
and
bone
and
blubber
were
little
short
of
audacity
they
know
not
the
thing
you
distantly
allude
to

and
bring
us

mark
aloft
there
at
the
three

if
caught
infallibly
will
again
soil
the
old
oaken
furniture
and
drop
at

one
small
grease-spot
somewhere
yes
and
many
is
the
time
when
after
the
severest
uninterrupted
labors
which
know
no
night
continuing
straight
through
for
ninety-six
hours
when
from
the
boat
where
they
have
swelled
their
wrists
with
all

rowing
on
the

only
step
to
the
deck
to
carry
vast
chains
and
heave
the
heavy
windlass
and
cut
and
slash
yea
and
in
their
very
sweatings
to
be
smoked
and
burned
anew
by
the
combined
fires
of
the
equatorial
sun
and
the
equatorial
try-works
when
on
the
heel
of
all
this
they
have
finally
bestirred
themselves
to
cleanse
the
ship
and
make
a
spotless
dairy
room
of
it
many
is
the
time
the
poor
fellows
just
buttoning
the
necks
of
their
clean
frocks
are
startled
by
the
cry
of
“there
she
blows!”
and
away
they
fly
to
fight
another
whale
and
go
through
the
whole
weary
thing
again
oh
my
friends
but
this
is
man-killing
yet
this
is
life
for
hardly
have
we
mortals
by
long
toilings
extracted
from
this
world’s
vast
bulk
its
small
but
valuable
sperm
and
then
with
weary
patience
cleansed
ourselves
from
its
defilements
and
learned
to
live
here
in
clean
tabernacles
of
the
soul
hardly
is
this
done
when—_there
she
blows!_—the
ghost
is
spouted
up
and
away
we
sail
to
fight
some
other
world
and
go
through
young
life’s
old
routine
again

the
doubloon
ere
now
it
has
been
related
how
ahab
was
wont
to
pace
his
quarter-deck
taking
regular
turns
at
either
limit
the
binnacle
and
mainmast
but
in
the
multiplicity
of
other
things
requiring
narration
it
has
not
been
added
how
that
sometimes
in
these
walks
when
most
plunged
in
his
mood
he
was
wont
to
pause
in
turn
at
each
spot
and
stand
there
strangely
eyeing
the
particular
object
before
him
when
he
halted
before
the
binnacle
with
his
glance
fastened
on
the
pointed
needle
in
the
compass
that
glance
shot
like
a
javelin
with
the
pointed
intensity
of
his
purpose
and
when
resuming
his
walk
he
again
paused
before
the
mainmast
then
as
the
same
riveted
glance
fastened
upon
the
riveted
gold
coin
there
he
still
wore
the
same
aspect
of
nailed
firmness
only
dashed
with
a
certain
wild
longing
if
not
hopefulness
but
one
morning
turning
to
pass
the
doubloon
he
seemed
to
be
newly
attracted
by
the
strange
figures
and
inscriptions
stamped
on
it
as
though
now
for
the
first
time
beginning
to
interpret
for
himself
in
some
monomaniac
way
whatever
significance
might
lurk
in
them
and
some
certain
significance
lurks
in
all
things
else
all
things
are
little
worth
and
the
round
world
itself
but
an
empty
cipher
except
to
sell
by
the
cartload
as
they
do
hills
about
boston
to
fill
up
some
morass
in
the
milky
way
now
this
doubloon
was
of
purest
virgin
gold
raked
somewhere
out
of
the
heart
of
gorgeous
hills
whence
east
and
west
over
golden
sands
the
head-waters
of
many
a
pactolus
flows
and
though
now
nailed
amidst
all
the
rustiness
of
iron
bolts
and
the
verdigris
of
copper
spikes
yet
untouchable
and
immaculate
to
any
foulness
it
still
preserved
its
quito
glow
nor
though
placed
amongst
a
ruthless
crew
and
every
hour
passed
by
ruthless
hands
and
through
the
livelong
nights
shrouded
with
thick
darkness
which
might
cover
any
pilfering
approach
nevertheless
every
sunrise
found
the
doubloon
where
the
sunset
left
it
last
for
it
was
set
apart
and
sanctified
to
one
awe-striking
end
and
however
wanton
in
their
sailor
ways
one
and
all
the
mariners
revered
it
as
the
white
whale’s
talisman
sometimes
they
talked
it
over
in
the
weary
watch
by
night
wondering
whose
it
was
to
be
at
last
and
whether
he
would
ever
live
to
spend
it
now
those
noble
golden
coins
of
south
america
are
as
medals
of
the
sun
and
tropic
token-pieces
here
palms
alpacas
and
volcanoes
sun’s
disks
and
stars
ecliptics
horns-of-plenty
and
rich
banners
waving
are
in
luxuriant
profusion
stamped
so
that
the
precious
gold
seems
almost
to
derive
an
added
preciousness
and
enhancing
glories
by
passing
through
those
fancy
mints
so
spanishly
poetic
it
so
chanced
that
the
doubloon
of
the
pequod
was
a
most
wealthy
example
of
these
things
on
its
round
border
it
bore
the
letters

quito
so
this
bright
coin
came
from
a
country
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
world
and
beneath
the
great
equator
and
named
after
it
and
it
had
been
cast
midway
up
the
andes
in
the
unwaning
clime
that
knows
no
autumn
zoned
by
those
letters
you
saw
the
likeness
of
three
andes’
summits
from
one
a
flame
a
tower
on
another
on
the
third
a
crowing
cock
while
arching
over
all
was
a
segment
of
the
partitioned
zodiac
the
signs
all
marked
with
their
usual
cabalistics
and
the
keystone
sun
entering
the
equinoctial
point
at
libra
before
this
equatorial
coin
ahab
not
unobserved
by
others
was
now
pausing
“there’s
something

of
the

“no

to
himself
leaning
against
the
bulwarks

and
wonders
truly
that
now
is
what
old
bowditch
in
his
epitome
calls
the
zodiac
and
what
my
almanac
below
calls
ditto
i’ll
get
the
almanac
and
as
i
have
heard
devils
can
be
raised
with
daboll’s
arithmetic
i’ll
try
my
hand
at
raising
a
meaning
out
of
these
queer
curvicues
here
with
the
massachusetts
calendar
here’s
the
book
let’s
see
now
signs
and
wonders
and
the
sun
he’s
always
among
’em
hem
hem
hem
here
they
are—here
they
go—all
alive:—aries
or
the
ram
taurus
or
the
bull
and
jimimi
here’s
gemini
himself
or
the
twins
well
the
sun
he
wheels
among
’em
aye
here
on
the
coin
he’s
just
crossing
the
threshold
between
two
of
twelve
sitting-rooms
all
in
a
ring
book
you
lie
there
the
fact
is
you
books
must
know
your
places
you’ll
do
to
give
us
the
bare
words
and
facts
but
we
come
in
to
supply
the
thoughts
that’s
my
small
experience
so
far
as
the
massachusetts
calendar
and
bowditch’s
navigator
and
daboll’s
arithmetic
go
signs
and
wonders
eh
pity
if
there
is
nothing
wonderful
in
signs
and
significant
in
wonders
there’s
a
clue
somewhere
wait
a
bit
hist—hark
by
jove
i
have
it
look
you
doubloon
your
zodiac
here
is
the
life
of
man
in
one
round
chapter
and
now
i’ll
read
it
off
straight
out
of
the
book
come
almanack
to
begin
there’s
aries
or
the
ram—lecherous
dog
he
begets
us
then
taurus
or
the
bull—he
bumps
us
the
first
thing
then
gemini
or
the
twins—that
is
virtue
and
vice
we
try
to
reach
virtue
when
lo
comes
cancer
the
crab
and
drags
us
back
and
here
going
from
virtue
leo
a
roaring
lion
lies
in
the
path—he
gives
a
few
fierce
bites
and
surly
dabs
with
his
paw
we
escape
and
hail
virgo
the
virgin
that’s
our
first
love
we
marry
and
think
to
be
happy
for
aye
when
pop
comes
libra
or
the
scales—happiness
weighed
and
found
wanting
and
while
we
are
very
sad
about
that
lord
how
we
suddenly
jump
as
scorpio
or
the
scorpion
stings
us
in
the
rear
we
are
curing
the
wound
when
whang
come
the
arrows
all
round
sagittarius
or
the
archer
is
amusing
himself
as
we
pluck
out
the
shafts
stand
aside
here’s
the
battering-ram
capricornus
or
the
goat
full
tilt
he
comes
rushing
and
headlong
we
are
tossed
when
aquarius
or
the
water-bearer
pours
out
his
whole
deluge
and
drowns
us
and
to
wind
up
with
pisces
or
the
fishes
we
sleep
there’s
a
sermon
now
writ
in
high
heaven
and
the
sun
goes
through
it
every
year
and
yet
comes
out
of
it
all
alive
and
hearty
jollily
he
aloft
there
wheels
through
toil
and
trouble
and
so
alow
here
does
jolly
stubb
oh
jolly’s
the
word
for
aye
adieu
doubloon
but
stop
here
comes
little
king-post
dodge
round
the
try-works
now
and
let’s
hear
what
he’ll
have
to
say
there
he’s
before
it
he’ll
out
with
something
presently
so
so
he’s
beginning.”
“i
see
nothing
here
but
a
round
thing
made
of
gold
and
whoever
raises
a
certain
whale
this
round
thing
belongs
to
him
so
what’s
all
this
staring
been
about
it
is
worth
sixteen
dollars
that’s
true
and
at
two
cents
the
cigar
that’s
nine
hundred
and
sixty
cigars
i
won’t
smoke
dirty
pipes
like
stubb
but
i
like
cigars
and
here’s
nine
hundred
and
sixty
of
them
so
here
goes
flask
aloft
to
spy
’em
out.”
“shall
i
call
that
wise
or
foolish
now
if
it
be
really
wise
it
has
a
foolish
look
to
it
yet
if
it
be
really
foolish
then
has
it
a
sort
of
wiseish
look
to
it
but
avast
here
comes
our
old
manxman—the
old
hearse-driver
he
must
have
been
that
is
before
he
took
to
the
sea
he
luffs
up
before
the
doubloon
halloa
and
goes
round
on
the
other
side
of
the
mast
why
there’s
a
horse-shoe
nailed
on
that
side
and
now
he’s
back
again
what
does
that
mean
hark
he’s
muttering—voice
like
an
old
worn-out
coffee-mill
prick
ears
and
listen!”
“if
the
white
whale
be
raised
it
must
be
in
a
month
and
a
day
when
the
sun
stands
in
some
one
of
these
signs
i’ve
studied
signs
and
know
their
marks
they
were
taught
me
two
score
years
ago
by
the
old
witch
in
copenhagen
now
in
what
sign
will
the
sun
then
be
the
horse-shoe
sign
for
there
it
is
right
opposite
the
gold
and
what’s
the
horse-shoe
sign
the
lion
is
the
horse-shoe
sign—the
roaring
and
devouring
lion
ship
old
ship
my
old
head
shakes
to
think
of
thee.”
“there’s
another
rendering
now
but
still
one
text
all
sorts
of
men
in
one
kind
of
world
you
see
dodge
again
here
comes
queequeg—all
tattooing—looks
like
the
signs
of
the

comparing
notes
looking
at
his

the
sun

in
the

or
in
the

i
suppose
as
the
old
women
talk
surgeon’s
astronomy
in
the
back
country
and
by
jove
he’s
found
something
there
in
the
vicinity
of
his

guess
it’s
sagittarius
or
the
archer
no
he
don’t
know
what
to
make
of
the
doubloon
he
takes
it
for
an
old
button
off
some
king’s
trowsers

aside
again
here
comes
that

out
of

toes
of

that

“i

“upon

“here’s

leg
and
arm
the
pequod
of
nantucket
meets
the
samuel
enderby
of
london
“ship
ahoy
hast
seen
the
white
whale?”
so
cried
ahab
once
more
hailing
a
ship
showing
english
colours
bearing
down
under
the
stern
trumpet
to
mouth
the
old
man
was
standing
in
his
hoisted
quarter-boat
his
ivory
leg
plainly
revealed
to
the
stranger
captain
who
was
carelessly
reclining
in
his
own
boat’s
bow
he
was
a
darkly-tanned
burly
good-natured
fine-looking
man
of
sixty
or
thereabouts
dressed
in
a
spacious
roundabout
that
hung
round
him
in
festoons
of
blue
pilot-cloth
and
one
empty
arm
of
this
jacket
streamed
behind
him
like
the
broidered
arm
of
a
hussar’s
surcoat
“hast
seen
the
white
whale?”
“see
you
this?”
and
withdrawing
it
from
the
folds
that
had
hidden
it
he
held
up
a
white
arm
of
sperm
whale
bone
terminating
in
a
wooden
head
like
a
mallet
“man
my
boat!”
cried
ahab
impetuously
and
tossing
about
the
oars
near
him—“stand
by
to
lower!”
in
less
than
a
minute
without
quitting
his
little
craft
he
and
his
crew
were
dropped
to
the
water
and
were
soon
alongside
of
the
stranger
but
here
a
curious
difficulty
presented
itself
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
ahab
had
forgotten
that
since
the
loss
of
his
leg
he
had
never
once
stepped
on
board
of
any
vessel
at
sea
but
his
own
and
then
it
was
always
by
an
ingenious
and
very
handy
mechanical
contrivance
peculiar
to
the
pequod
and
a
thing
not
to
be
rigged
and
shipped
in
any
other
vessel
at
a
moment’s
warning
now
it
is
no
very
easy
matter
for
anybody—except
those
who
are
almost
hourly
used
to
it
like
whalemen—to
clamber
up
a
ship’s
side
from
a
boat
on
the
open
sea
for
the
great
swells
now
lift
the
boat
high
up
towards
the
bulwarks
and
then
instantaneously
drop
it
half
way
down
to
the
kelson
so
deprived
of
one
leg
and
the
strange
ship
of
course
being
altogether
unsupplied
with
the
kindly
invention
ahab
now
found
himself
abjectly
reduced
to
a
clumsy
landsman
again
hopelessly
eyeing
the
uncertain
changeful
height
he
could
hardly
hope
to
attain
it
has
before
been
hinted
perhaps
that
every
little
untoward
circumstance
that
befell
him
and
which
indirectly
sprang
from
his
luckless
mishap
almost
invariably
irritated
or
exasperated
ahab
and
in
the
present
instance
all
this
was
heightened
by
the
sight
of
the
two
officers
of
the
strange
ship
leaning
over
the
side
by
the
perpendicular
ladder
of
nailed
cleets
there
and
swinging
towards
him
a
pair
of
tastefully-ornamented
man-ropes
for
at
first
they
did
not
seem
to
bethink
them
that
a
one-legged
man
must
be
too
much
of
a
cripple
to
use
their
sea
bannisters
but
this
awkwardness
only
lasted
a
minute
because
the
strange
captain
observing
at
a
glance
how
affairs
stood
cried
out
“i
see
i
see!—avast
heaving
there
jump
boys
and
swing
over
the
cutting-tackle.”
as
good
luck
would
have
it
they
had
had
a
whale
alongside
a
day
or
two
previous
and
the
great
tackles
were
still
aloft
and
the
massive
curved
blubber-hook
now
clean
and
dry
was
still
attached
to
the
end
this
was
quickly
lowered
to
ahab
who
at
once
comprehending
it
all
slid
his
solitary
thigh
into
the
curve
of
the
hook
it
was
like
sitting
in
the
fluke
of
an
anchor
or
the
crotch
of
an
apple
tree
and
then
giving
the
word
held
himself
fast
and
at
the
same
time
also
helped
to
hoist
his
own
weight
by
pulling
hand-over-hand
upon
one
of
the
running
parts
of
the
tackle
soon
he
was
carefully
swung
inside
the
high
bulwarks
and
gently
landed
upon
the
capstan
head
with
his
ivory
arm
frankly
thrust
forth
in
welcome
the
other
captain
advanced
and
ahab
putting
out
his
ivory
leg
and
crossing
the
ivory
arm
like
two
sword-fish
blades
cried
out
in
his
walrus
way
“aye
aye
hearty
let
us
shake
bones
together!—an
arm
and
a
leg!—an
arm
that
never
can
shrink
d’ye
see
and
a
leg
that
never
can
run
where
did’st
thou
see
the
white
whale?—how
long
ago?”
“the
white
whale,”
said
the
englishman
pointing
his
ivory
arm
towards
the
east
and
taking
a
rueful
sight
along
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
telescope
“there
i
saw
him
on
the
line
last
season.”
“and
he
took
that
arm
off
did
he?”
asked
ahab
now
sliding
down
from
the
capstan
and
resting
on
the
englishman’s
shoulder
as
he
did
so
“aye
he
was
the
cause
of
it
at
least
and
that
leg
too?”
“spin
me
the
yarn,”
said
ahab
“how
was
it?”
“it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
ever
cruised
on
the
line,”
began
the
englishman
“i
was
ignorant
of
the
white
whale
at
that
time
well
one
day
we
lowered
for
a
pod
of
four
or
five
whales
and
my
boat
fastened
to
one
of
them
a
regular
circus
horse
he
was
too
that
went
milling
and
milling
round
so
that
my
boat’s
crew
could
only
trim
dish
by
sitting
all
their
sterns
on
the
outer
gunwale
presently
up
breaches
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
a
bouncing
great
whale
with
a
milky-white
head
and
hump
all
crows’
feet
and
wrinkles.”
“it
was
he
it
was
he!”
cried
ahab
suddenly
letting
out
his
suspended
breath
“and
harpoons
sticking
in
near
his
starboard
fin.”
“aye
aye—they
were
mine—_my_
irons,”
cried
ahab
exultingly—“but
on!”
“give
me
a
chance
then,”
said
the
englishman
good-humoredly
“well
this
old
great-grandfather
with
the
white
head
and
hump
runs
all
afoam
into
the
pod
and
goes
to
snapping
furiously
at
my
fast-line
“aye
i
see!—wanted
to
part
it
free
the
fast-fish—an
old
trick—i
know
him.”
“how
it
was
exactly,”
continued
the
one-armed
commander
“i
do
not
know
but
in
biting
the
line
it
got
foul
of
his
teeth
caught
there
somehow
but
we
didn’t
know
it
then
so
that
when
we
afterwards
pulled
on
the
line
bounce
we
came
plump
on
to
his
hump
instead
of
the
other
whale’s
that
went
off
to
windward
all
fluking
seeing
how
matters
stood
and
what
a
noble
great
whale
it
was—the
noblest
and
biggest
i
ever
saw
sir
in
my
life—i
resolved
to
capture
him
spite
of
the
boiling
rage
he
seemed
to
be
in
and
thinking
the
hap-hazard
line
would
get
loose
or
the
tooth
it
was
tangled
to
might
draw
for
i
have
a
devil
of
a
boat’s
crew
for
a
pull
on
a
whale-line
seeing
all
this
i
say
i
jumped
into
my
first
mate’s
boat—mr
mounttop’s

way

i
was
saying
i
jumped
into
mounttop’s
boat
which
d’ye
see
was

and
gunwale
with
mine
then
and
snatching
the
first
harpoon
let
this
old
great-grandfather
have
it
but
lord
look
you
sir—hearts
and
souls
alive
man—the
next
instant
in
a
jiff
i
was
blind
as
a
bat—both
eyes
out—all
befogged
and
bedeadened
with
black
foam—the
whale’s
tail
looming
straight
up
out
of
it
perpendicular
in
the
air
like
a
marble
steeple
no
use
sterning
all
then
but
as
i
was
groping
at
midday
with
a
blinding
sun
all
crown-jewels
as
i
was

i

after
the
second

to

tail
like
a
lima
tower
cutting
my
boat
in
two
leaving
each
half
in
splinters
and
flukes
first
the
white
hump
backed
through
the
wreck
as
though
it
was
all
chips
we
all
struck
out
to
escape
his
terrible
flailings
i
seized
hold
of
my
harpoon-pole
sticking
in
him
and
for
a
moment
clung
to
that
like
a
sucking
fish
but
a
combing
sea
dashed
me
off
and
at
the
same
instant
the
fish
taking
one
good
dart
forwards
went
down
like
a
flash
and
the
barb
of
that
cursed
second
iron
towing
along
near
me
caught
me
here”
clapping
his
hand
just
below
his
shoulder
“yes
caught
me
just
here
i
say
and
bore
me
down
to
hell’s
flames
i
was
thinking
when
when
all
of
a
sudden
thank
the
good
god
the
barb
ript
its
way
along
the
flesh—clear
along
the
whole
length
of
my
arm—came
out
nigh
my
wrist
and
up
i
floated;—and
that
gentleman
there
will
tell
you
the
rest
by
the
way
captain—dr
bunger
ship’s
surgeon
bunger
my
lad,—the
captain
now
bunger
boy
spin
your
part
of
the
yarn.”
the
professional
gentleman
thus
familiarly
pointed
out
had
been
all
the
time
standing
near
them
with
nothing
specific
visible
to
denote
his
gentlemanly
rank
on
board
his
face
was
an
exceedingly
round
but
sober
one
he
was
dressed
in
a
faded
blue
woollen
frock
or
shirt
and
patched
trowsers
and
had
thus
far
been
dividing
his
attention
between
a
marlingspike
he
held
in
one
hand
and
a
pill-box
held
in
the
other
occasionally
casting
a
critical
glance
at
the
ivory
limbs
of
the
two
crippled
captains
but
at
his
superior’s
introduction
of
him
to
ahab
he
politely
bowed
and
straightway
went
on
to
do
his
captain’s
bidding
“it
was
a
shocking
bad
wound,”
began
the
whale-surgeon
“and
taking
my
advice
captain
boomer
here
stood
our
old
sammy—”
“samuel
enderby
is
the
name
of
my
ship,”
interrupted
the
one-armed
captain
addressing
ahab
“go
on
boy.”
“stood
our
old
sammy
off
to
the
northward
to
get
out
of
the
blazing
hot
weather
there
on
the
line
but
it
was
no
use—i
did
all
i
could
sat
up
with
him
nights
was
very
severe
with
him
in
the
matter
of
diet—”
“oh
very
severe!”
chimed
in
the
patient
himself
then
suddenly
altering
his
voice
“drinking
hot
rum
toddies
with
me
every
night
till
he
couldn’t
see
to
put
on
the
bandages
and
sending
me
to
bed
half
seas
over
about
three
o’clock
in
the
morning
oh
ye
stars
he
sat
up
with
me
indeed
and
was
very
severe
in
my
diet
oh
a
great
watcher
and
very
dietetically
severe
is
dr
bunger
bunger
you
dog
laugh
out
why
don’t
ye
you
know
you’re
a
precious
jolly
rascal
but
heave
ahead
boy
i’d
rather
be
killed
by
you
than
kept
alive
by
any
other
man.”
“my
captain
you
must
have
ere
this
perceived
respected
sir”—said
the
imperturbable
godly-looking
bunger
slightly
bowing
to
ahab—“is
apt
to
be
facetious
at
times
he
spins
us
many
clever
things
of
that
sort
but
i
may
as
well
say—en
passant
as
the
french
remark—that
i
myself—that
is
to
say
jack
bunger
late
of
the
reverend
clergy—am
a
strict
total
abstinence
man
i
never
drink—”
“water!”
cried
the
captain
“he
never
drinks
it
it’s
a
sort
of
fits
to
him
fresh
water
throws
him
into
the
hydrophobia
but
go
on—go
on
with
the
arm
story.”
“yes
i
may
as
well,”
said
the
surgeon
coolly
“i
was
about
observing
sir
before
captain
boomer’s
facetious
interruption
that
spite
of
my
best
and
severest
endeavors
the
wound
kept
getting
worse
and
worse
the
truth
was
sir
it
was
as
ugly
gaping
wound
as
surgeon
ever
saw
more
than
two
feet
and
several
inches
long
i
measured
it
with
the
lead
line
in
short
it
grew
black
i
knew
what
was
threatened
and
off
it
came
but
i
had
no
hand
in
shipping
that
ivory
arm
there
that
thing
is
against
all
rule”—pointing
at
it
with
the
marlingspike—“that
is
the
captain’s
work
not
mine
he
ordered
the
carpenter
to
make
it
he
had
that
club-hammer
there
put
to
the
end
to
knock
some
one’s
brains
out
with
i
suppose
as
he
tried
mine
once
he
flies
into
diabolical
passions
sometimes
do
ye
see
this
dent
sir”—removing
his
hat
and
brushing
aside
his
hair
and
exposing
a
bowl-like
cavity
in
his
skull
but
which
bore
not
the
slightest
scarry
trace
or
any
token
of
ever
having
been
a
wound—“well
the
captain
there
will
tell
you
how
that
came
here
he
knows.”
“no
i
don’t,”
said
the
captain
“but
his
mother
did
he
was
born
with
it
oh
you
solemn
rogue
you—you
bunger
was
there
ever
such
another
bunger
in
the
watery
world
bunger
when
you
die
you
ought
to
die
in
pickle
you
dog
you
should
be
preserved
to
future
ages
you
rascal.”
“what
became
of
the
white
whale?”
now
cried
ahab
who
thus
far
had
been
impatiently
listening
to
this
by-play
between
the
two
englishmen
“oh!”
cried
the
one-armed
captain
“oh
yes
well
after
he
sounded
we
didn’t
see
him
again
for
some
time
in
fact
as
i
before
hinted
i
didn’t
then
know
what
whale
it
was
that
had
served
me
such
a
trick
till
some
time
afterwards
when
coming
back
to
the
line
we
heard
about
moby
dick—as
some
call
him—and
then
i
knew
it
was
he.”
“did’st
thou
cross
his
wake
again?”
“twice.”
“but
could
not
fasten?”
“didn’t
want
to
try
to
ain’t
one
limb
enough
what
should
i
do
without
this
other
arm
and
i’m
thinking
moby
dick
doesn’t
bite
so
much
as
he
swallows.”
“well
then,”
interrupted
bunger
“give
him
your
left
arm
for
bait
to
get
the
right
do
you
know
gentlemen”—very
gravely
and
mathematically
bowing
to
each
captain
in
succession—“do
you
know
gentlemen
that
the
digestive
organs
of
the
whale
are
so
inscrutably
constructed
by
divine
providence
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
him
to
completely
digest
even
a
man’s
arm
and
he
knows
it
too
so
that
what
you
take
for
the
white
whale’s
malice
is
only
his
awkwardness
for
he
never
means
to
swallow
a
single
limb
he
only
thinks
to
terrify
by
feints
but
sometimes
he
is
like
the
old
juggling
fellow
formerly
a
patient
of
mine
in
ceylon
that
making
believe
swallow
jack-knives
once
upon
a
time
let
one
drop
into
him
in
good
earnest
and
there
it
stayed
for
a
twelvemonth
or
more
when
i
gave
him
an
emetic
and
he
heaved
it
up
in
small
tacks
d’ye
see
no
possible
way
for
him
to
digest
that
jack-knife
and
fully
incorporate
it
into
his
general
bodily
system
yes
captain
boomer
if
you
are
quick
enough
about
it
and
have
a
mind
to
pawn
one
arm
for
the
sake
of
the
privilege
of
giving
decent
burial
to
the
other
why
in
that
case
the
arm
is
yours
only
let
the
whale
have
another
chance
at
you
shortly
that’s
all.”
“no
thank
ye
bunger,”
said
the
english
captain
“he’s
welcome
to
the
arm
he
has
since
i
can’t
help
it
and
didn’t
know
him
then
but
not
to
another
one
no
more
white
whales
for
me
i’ve
lowered
for
him
once
and
that
has
satisfied
me
there
would
be
great
glory
in
killing
him
i
know
that
and
there
is
a
ship-load
of
precious
sperm
in
him
but
hark
ye
he’s
best
let
alone
don’t
you
think
so
captain?”—glancing
at
the
ivory
leg
“he
is
but
he
will
still
be
hunted
for
all
that
what
is
best
let
alone
that
accursed
thing
is
not
always
what
least
allures
he’s
all
a
magnet
how
long
since
thou
saw’st
him
last
which
way
heading?”
“bless
my
soul
and
curse
the
foul
fiend’s,”
cried
bunger
stoopingly
walking
round
ahab
and
like
a
dog
strangely
snuffing
“this
man’s
blood—bring
the
thermometer!—it’s
at
the
boiling
point!—his
pulse
makes
these
planks
beat!—sir!”—taking
a
lancet
from
his
pocket
and
drawing
near
to
ahab’s
arm
“avast!”
roared
ahab
dashing
him
against
the
bulwarks—“man
the
boat
which
way
heading?”
“good
god!”
cried
the
english
captain
to
whom
the
question
was
put
“what’s
the
matter
he
was
heading
east
i
think.—is
your
captain
crazy?”
whispering
fedallah
but
fedallah
putting
a
finger
on
his
lip
slid
over
the
bulwarks
to
take
the
boat’s
steering
oar
and
ahab
swinging
the
cutting-tackle
towards
him
commanded
the
ship’s
sailors
to
stand
by
to
lower
in
a
moment
he
was
standing
in
the
boat’s
stern
and
the
manilla
men
were
springing
to
their
oars
in
vain
the
english
captain
hailed
him
with
back
to
the
stranger
ship
and
face
set
like
a
flint
to
his
own
ahab
stood
upright
till
alongside
of
the
pequod
chapter
101
the
decanter
ere
the
english
ship
fades
from
sight
be
it
set
down
here
that
she
hailed
from
london
and
was
named
after
the
late
samuel
enderby
merchant
of
that
city
the
original
of
the
famous
whaling
house
of
enderby
&
sons
a
house
which
in
my
poor
whaleman’s
opinion
comes
not
far
behind
the
united
royal
houses
of
the
tudors
and
bourbons
in
point
of
real
historical
interest
how
long
prior
to
the
year
of
our
lord
1775
this
great
whaling
house
was
in
existence
my
numerous
fish-documents
do
not
make
plain
but
in
that
year
1775
it
fitted
out
the
first
english
ships
that
ever
regularly
hunted
the
sperm
whale
though
for
some
score
of
years
previous
ever
since
1726
our
valiant
coffins
and
maceys
of
nantucket
and
the
vineyard
had
in
large
fleets
pursued
that
leviathan
but
only
in
the
north
and
south
atlantic
not
elsewhere
be
it
distinctly
recorded
here
that
the
nantucketers
were
the
first
among
mankind
to
harpoon
with
civilized
steel
the
great
sperm
whale
and
that
for
half
a
century
they
were
the
only
people
of
the
whole
globe
who
so
harpooned
him
in
1778
a
fine
ship
the
amelia
fitted
out
for
the
express
purpose
and
at
the
sole
charge
of
the
vigorous
enderbys
boldly
rounded
cape
horn
and
was
the
first
among
the
nations
to
lower
a
whale-boat
of
any
sort
in
the
great
south
sea
the
voyage
was
a
skilful
and
lucky
one
and
returning
to
her
berth
with
her
hold
full
of
the
precious
sperm
the
amelia’s
example
was
soon
followed
by
other
ships
english
and
american
and
thus
the
vast
sperm
whale
grounds
of
the
pacific
were
thrown
open
but
not
content
with
this
good
deed
the
indefatigable
house
again
bestirred
itself
samuel
and
all
his
sons—how
many
their
mother
only
knows—and
under
their
immediate
auspices
and
partly
i
think
at
their
expense
the
british
government
was
induced
to
send
the
sloop-of-war
rattler
on
a
whaling
voyage
of
discovery
into
the
south
sea
commanded
by
a
naval
post-captain
the
rattler
made
a
rattling
voyage
of
it
and
did
some
service
how
much
does
not
appear
but
this
is
not
all
in
1819
the
same
house
fitted
out
a
discovery
whale
ship
of
their
own
to
go
on
a
tasting
cruise
to
the
remote
waters
of
japan
that
ship—well
called
the
“syren”—made
a
noble
experimental
cruise
and
it
was
thus
that
the
great
japanese
whaling
ground
first
became
generally
known
the
syren
in
this
famous
voyage
was
commanded
by
a
captain
coffin
a
nantucketer
all
honor
to
the
enderbies
therefore
whose
house
i
think
exists
to
the
present
day
though
doubtless
the
original
samuel
must
long
ago
have
slipped
his
cable
for
the
great
south
sea
of
the
other
world
the
ship
named
after
him
was
worthy
of
the
honor
being
a
very
fast
sailer
and
a
noble
craft
every
way
i
boarded
her
once
at
midnight
somewhere
off
the
patagonian
coast
and
drank
good
flip
down
in
the
forecastle
it
was
a
fine
gam
we
had
and
they
were
all
trumps—every
soul
on
board
a
short
life
to
them
and
a
jolly
death
and
that
fine
gam
i
had—long
very
long
after
old
ahab
touched
her
planks
with
his
ivory
heel—it
minds
me
of
the
noble
solid
saxon
hospitality
of
that
ship
and
may
my
parson
forget
me
and
the
devil
remember
me
if
i
ever
lose
sight
of
it
flip
did
i
say
we
had
flip
yes
and
we
flipped
it
at
the
rate
of
ten
gallons
the
hour
and
when
the
squall
came
for
it’s
squally
off
there
by
patagonia
and
all
hands—visitors
and
all—were
called
to
reef
topsails
we
were
so
top-heavy
that
we
had
to
swing
each
other
aloft
in
bowlines
and
we
ignorantly
furled
the
skirts
of
our
jackets
into
the
sails
so
that
we
hung
there
reefed
fast
in
the
howling
gale
a
warning
example
to
all
drunken
tars
however
the
masts
did
not
go
overboard
and
by
and
by
we
scrambled
down
so
sober
that
we
had
to
pass
the
flip
again
though
the
savage
salt
spray
bursting
down
the
forecastle
scuttle
rather
too
much
diluted
and
pickled
it
to
my
taste
the
beef
was
fine—tough
but
with
body
in
it
they
said
it
was
bull-beef
others
that
it
was
dromedary
beef
but
i
do
not
know
for
certain
how
that
was
they
had
dumplings
too
small
but
substantial
symmetrically
globular
and
indestructible
dumplings
i
fancied
that
you
could
feel
them
and
roll
them
about
in
you
after
they
were
swallowed
if
you
stooped
over
too
far
forward
you
risked
their
pitching
out
of
you
like
billiard-balls
the
bread—but
that
couldn’t
be
helped
besides
it
was
an
anti-scorbutic
in
short
the
bread
contained
the
only
fresh
fare
they
had
but
the
forecastle
was
not
very
light
and
it
was
very
easy
to
step
over
into
a
dark
corner
when
you
ate
it
but
all
in
all
taking
her
from
truck
to
helm
considering
the
dimensions
of
the
cook’s
boilers
including
his
own
live
parchment
boilers
fore
and
aft
i
say
the
samuel
enderby
was
a
jolly
ship
of
good
fare
and
plenty
fine
flip
and
strong
crack
fellows
all
and
capital
from
boot
heels
to
hat-band
but
why
was
it
think
ye
that
the
samuel
enderby
and
some
other
english
whalers
i
know
of—not
all
though—were
such
famous
hospitable
ships
that
passed
round
the
beef
and
the
bread
and
the
can
and
the
joke
and
were
not
soon
weary
of
eating
and
drinking
and
laughing
i
will
tell
you
the
abounding
good
cheer
of
these
english
whalers
is
matter
for
historical
research
nor
have
i
been
at
all
sparing
of
historical
whale
research
when
it
has
seemed
needed
the
english
were
preceded
in
the
whale
fishery
by
the
hollanders
zealanders
and
danes
from
whom
they
derived
many
terms
still
extant
in
the
fishery
and
what
is
yet
more
their
fat
old
fashions
touching
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
for
as
a
general
thing
the
english
merchant-ship
scrimps
her
crew
but
not
so
the
english
whaler
hence
in
the
english
this
thing
of
whaling
good
cheer
is
not
normal
and
natural
but
incidental
and
particular
and
therefore
must
have
some
special
origin
which
is
here
pointed
out
and
will
be
still
further
elucidated
during
my
researches
in
the
leviathanic
histories
i
stumbled
upon
an
ancient
dutch
volume
which
by
the
musty
whaling
smell
of
it
i
knew
must
be
about
whalers
the
title
was
“dan
coopman,”
wherefore
i
concluded
that
this
must
be
the
invaluable
memoirs
of
some
amsterdam
cooper
in
the
fishery
as
every
whale
ship
must
carry
its
cooper
i
was
reinforced
in
this
opinion
by
seeing
that
it
was
the
production
of
one
“fitz
swackhammer.”
but
my
friend
dr
snodhead
a
very
learned
man
professor
of
low
dutch
and
high
german
in
the
college
of
santa
claus
and
st
pott’s
to
whom
i
handed
the
work
for
translation
giving
him
a
box
of
sperm
candles
for
his
trouble—this
same
dr
snodhead
so
soon
as
he
spied
the
book
assured
me
that
“dan
coopman”
did
not
mean
“the
cooper,”
but
“the
merchant.”
in
short
this
ancient
and
learned
low
dutch
book
treated
of
the
commerce
of
holland
and
among
other
subjects
contained
a
very
interesting
account
of
its
whale
fishery
and
in
this
chapter
it
was
headed
“smeer,”
or
“fat,”
that
i
found
a
long
detailed
list
of
the
outfits
for
the
larders
and
cellars
of
180
sail
of
dutch
whalemen
from
which
list
as
translated
by
dr
snodhead
i
transcribe
the
following
400,000
lbs
of
beef
60,000
lbs
friesland
pork
150,000
lbs
of
stock
fish
550,000
lbs
of
biscuit
72,000
lbs
of
soft
bread
2,800
firkins
of
butter
20,000
lbs
texel
&
leyden
cheese
144,000
lbs
cheese
probably
an
inferior
article
550
ankers
of
geneva
10,800
barrels
of
beer
most
statistical
tables
are
parchingly
dry
in
the
reading
not
so
in
the
present
case
however
where
the
reader
is
flooded
with
whole
pipes
barrels
quarts
and
gills
of
good
gin
and
good
cheer
at
the
time
i
devoted
three
days
to
the
studious
digesting
of
all
this
beer
beef
and
bread
during
which
many
profound
thoughts
were
incidentally
suggested
to
me
capable
of
a
transcendental
and
platonic
application
and
furthermore
i
compiled
supplementary
tables
of
my
own
touching
the
probable
quantity
of
stock-fish
etc
consumed
by
every
low
dutch
harpooneer
in
that
ancient
greenland
and
spitzbergen
whale
fishery
in
the
first
place
the
amount
of
butter
and
texel
and
leyden
cheese
consumed
seems
amazing
i
impute
it
though
to
their
naturally
unctuous
natures
being
rendered
still
more
unctuous
by
the
nature
of
their
vocation
and
especially
by
their
pursuing
their
game
in
those
frigid
polar
seas
on
the
very
coasts
of
that
esquimaux
country
where
the
convivial
natives
pledge
each
other
in
bumpers
of
train
oil
the
quantity
of
beer
too
is
very
large
10,800
barrels
now
as
those
polar
fisheries
could
only
be
prosecuted
in
the
short
summer
of
that
climate
so
that
the
whole
cruise
of
one
of
these
dutch
whalemen
including
the
short
voyage
to
and
from
the
spitzbergen
sea
did
not
much
exceed
three
months
say
and
reckoning
30
men
to
each
of
their
fleet
of
180
sail
we
have
5,400
low
dutch
seamen
in
all
therefore
i
say
we
have
precisely
two
barrels
of
beer
per
man
for
a
twelve
weeks’
allowance
exclusive
of
his
fair
proportion
of
that
550
ankers
of
gin
now
whether
these
gin
and
beer
harpooneers
so
fuddled
as
one
might
fancy
them
to
have
been
were
the
right
sort
of
men
to
stand
up
in
a
boat’s
head
and
take
good
aim
at
flying
whales
this
would
seem
somewhat
improbable
yet
they
did
aim
at
them
and
hit
them
too
but
this
was
very
far
north
be
it
remembered
where
beer
agrees
well
with
the
constitution
upon
the
equator
in
our
southern
fishery
beer
would
be
apt
to
make
the
harpooneer
sleepy
at
the
mast-head
and
boozy
in
his
boat
and
grievous
loss
might
ensue
to
nantucket
and
new
bedford
but
no
more
enough
has
been
said
to
show
that
the
old
dutch
whalers
of
two
or
three
centuries
ago
were
high
livers
and
that
the
english
whalers
have
not
neglected
so
excellent
an
example
for
say
they
when
cruising
in
an
empty
ship
if
you
can
get
nothing
better
out
of
the
world
get
a
good
dinner
out
of
it
at
least
and
this
empties
the
decanter
chapter
102
a
bower
in
the
arsacides
hitherto
in
descriptively
treating
of
the
sperm
whale
i
have
chiefly
dwelt
upon
the
marvels
of
his
outer
aspect
or
separately
and
in
detail
upon
some
few
interior
structural
features
but
to
a
large
and
thorough
sweeping
comprehension
of
him
it
behooves
me
now
to
unbutton
him
still
further
and
untagging
the
points
of
his
hose
unbuckling
his
garters
and
casting
loose
the
hooks
and
the
eyes
of
the
joints
of
his
innermost
bones
set
him
before
you
in
his
ultimatum
that
is
to
say
in
his
unconditional
skeleton
but
how
now
ishmael
how
is
it
that
you
a
mere
oarsman
in
the
fishery
pretend
to
know
aught
about
the
subterranean
parts
of
the
whale
did
erudite
stubb
mounted
upon
your
capstan
deliver
lectures
on
the
anatomy
of
the
cetacea
and
by
help
of
the
windlass
hold
up
a
specimen
rib
for
exhibition
explain
thyself
ishmael
can
you
land
a
full-grown
whale
on
your
deck
for
examination
as
a
cook
dishes
a
roast-pig
surely
not
a
veritable
witness
have
you
hitherto
been
ishmael
but
have
a
care
how
you
seize
the
privilege
of
jonah
alone
the
privilege
of
discoursing
upon
the
joists
and
beams
the
rafters
ridge-pole
sleepers
and
under-pinnings
making
up
the
frame-work
of
leviathan
and
belike
of
the
tallow-vats
dairy-rooms
butteries
and
cheeseries
in
his
bowels
i
confess
that
since
jonah
few
whalemen
have
penetrated
very
far
beneath
the
skin
of
the
adult
whale
nevertheless
i
have
been
blessed
with
an
opportunity
to
dissect
him
in
miniature
in
a
ship
i
belonged
to
a
small
cub
sperm
whale
was
once
bodily
hoisted
to
the
deck
for
his
poke
or
bag
to
make
sheaths
for
the
barbs
of
the
harpoons
and
for
the
heads
of
the
lances
think
you
i
let
that
chance
go
without
using
my
boat-hatchet
and
jack-knife
and
breaking
the
seal
and
reading
all
the
contents
of
that
young
cub
and
as
for
my
exact
knowledge
of
the
bones
of
the
leviathan
in
their
gigantic
full
grown
development
for
that
rare
knowledge
i
am
indebted
to
my
late
royal
friend
tranquo
king
of
tranque
one
of
the
arsacides
for
being
at
tranque
years
ago
when
attached
to
the
trading-ship
dey
of
algiers
i
was
invited
to
spend
part
of
the
arsacidean
holidays
with
the
lord
of
tranque
at
his
retired
palm
villa
at
pupella
a
sea-side
glen
not
very
far
distant
from
what
our
sailors
called
bamboo-town
his
capital
among
many
other
fine
qualities
my
royal
friend
tranquo
being
gifted
with
a
devout
love
for
all
matters
of
barbaric
vertu
had
brought
together
in
pupella
whatever
rare
things
the
more
ingenious
of
his
people
could
invent
chiefly
carved
woods
of
wonderful
devices
chiselled
shells
inlaid
spears
costly
paddles
aromatic
canoes
and
all
these
distributed
among
whatever
natural
wonders
the
wonder-freighted
tribute-rendering
waves
had
cast
upon
his
shores
chief
among
these
latter
was
a
great
sperm
whale
which
after
an
unusually
long
raging
gale
had
been
found
dead
and
stranded
with
his
head
against
a
cocoa-nut
tree
whose
plumage-like
tufted
droopings
seemed
his
verdant
jet
when
the
vast
body
had
at
last
been
stripped
of
its
fathom-deep
enfoldings
and
the
bones
become
dust
dry
in
the
sun
then
the
skeleton
was
carefully
transported
up
the
pupella
glen
where
a
grand
temple
of
lordly
palms
now
sheltered
it
the
ribs
were
hung
with
trophies
the
vertebræ
were
carved
with
arsacidean
annals
in
strange
hieroglyphics
in
the
skull
the
priests
kept
up
an
unextinguished
aromatic
flame
so
that
the
mystic
head
again
sent
forth
its
vapory
spout
while
suspended
from
a
bough
the
terrific
lower
jaw
vibrated
over
all
the
devotees
like
the
hair-hung
sword
that
so
affrighted
damocles
it
was
a
wondrous
sight
the
wood
was
green
as
mosses
of
the
icy
glen
the
trees
stood
high
and
haughty
feeling
their
living
sap
the
industrious
earth
beneath
was
as
a
weaver’s
loom
with
a
gorgeous
carpet
on
it
whereof
the
ground-vine
tendrils
formed
the
warp
and
woof
and
the
living
flowers
the
figures
all
the
trees
with
all
their
laden
branches
all
the
shrubs
and
ferns
and
grasses
the
message-carrying
air
all
these
unceasingly
were
active
through
the
lacings
of
the
leaves
the
great
sun
seemed
a
flying
shuttle
weaving
the
unwearied
verdure
oh
busy
weaver
unseen
weaver!—pause!—one
word!—whither
flows
the
fabric
what
palace
may
it
deck
wherefore
all
these
ceaseless
toilings
speak
weaver!—stay
thy
hand!—but
one
single
word
with
thee
nay—the
shuttle
flies—the
figures
float
from
forth
the
loom
the
freshet-rushing
carpet
for
ever
slides
away
the
weaver-god
he
weaves
and
by
that
weaving
is
he
deafened
that
he
hears
no
mortal
voice
and
by
that
humming
we
too
who
look
on
the
loom
are
deafened
and
only
when
we
escape
it
shall
we
hear
the
thousand
voices
that
speak
through
it
for
even
so
it
is
in
all
material
factories
the
spoken
words
that
are
inaudible
among
the
flying
spindles
those
same
words
are
plainly
heard
without
the
walls
bursting
from
the
opened
casements
thereby
have
villainies
been
detected
ah
mortal
then
be
heedful
for
so
in
all
this
din
of
the
great
world’s
loom
thy
subtlest
thinkings
may
be
overheard
afar
now
amid
the
green
life-restless
loom
of
that
arsacidean
wood
the
great
white
worshipped
skeleton
lay
lounging—a
gigantic
idler
yet
as
the
ever-woven
verdant
warp
and
woof
intermixed
and
hummed
around
him
the
mighty
idler
seemed
the
cunning
weaver
himself
all
woven
over
with
the
vines
every
month
assuming
greener
fresher
verdure
but
himself
a
skeleton
life
folded
death
death
trellised
life
the
grim
god
wived
with
youthful
life
and
begat
him
curly-headed
glories
now
when
with
royal
tranquo
i
visited
this
wondrous
whale
and
saw
the
skull
an
altar
and
the
artificial
smoke
ascending
from
where
the
real
jet
had
issued
i
marvelled
that
the
king
should
regard
a
chapel
as
an
object
of
vertu
he
laughed
but
more
i
marvelled
that
the
priests
should
swear
that
smoky
jet
of
his
was
genuine
to
and
fro
i
paced
before
this
skeleton—brushed
the
vines
aside—broke
through
the
ribs—and
with
a
ball
of
arsacidean
twine
wandered
eddied
long
amid
its
many
winding
shaded
colonnades
and
arbours
but
soon
my
line
was
out
and
following
it
back
i
emerged
from
the
opening
where
i
entered
i
saw
no
living
thing
within
naught
was
there
but
bones
cutting
me
a
green
measuring-rod
i
once
more
dived
within
the
skeleton
from
their
arrow-slit
in
the
skull
the
priests
perceived
me
taking
the
altitude
of
the
final
rib
“how
now!”
they
shouted
“dar’st
thou
measure
this
our
god
that’s
for
us.”
“aye
priests—well
how
long
do
ye
make
him
then?”
but
hereupon
a
fierce
contest
rose
among
them
concerning
feet
and
inches
they
cracked
each
other’s
sconces
with
their
yard-sticks—the
great
skull
echoed—and
seizing
that
lucky
chance
i
quickly
concluded
my
own
admeasurements
these
admeasurements
i
now
propose
to
set
before
you
but
first
be
it
recorded
that
in
this
matter
i
am
not
free
to
utter
any
fancied
measurement
i
please
because
there
are
skeleton
authorities
you
can
refer
to
to
test
my
accuracy
there
is
a
leviathanic
museum
they
tell
me
in
hull
england
one
of
the
whaling
ports
of
that
country
where
they
have
some
fine
specimens
of
fin-backs
and
other
whales
likewise
i
have
heard
that
in
the
museum
of
manchester
in
new
hampshire
they
have
what
the
proprietors
call
“the
only
perfect
specimen
of
a
greenland
or
river
whale
in
the
united
states.”
moreover
at
a
place
in
yorkshire
england
burton
constable
by
name
a
certain
sir
clifford
constable
has
in
his
possession
the
skeleton
of
a
sperm
whale
but
of
moderate
size
by
no
means
of
the
full-grown
magnitude
of
my
friend
king
tranquo’s
in
both
cases
the
stranded
whales
to
which
these
two
skeletons
belonged
were
originally
claimed
by
their
proprietors
upon
similar
grounds
king
tranquo
seizing
his
because
he
wanted
it
and
sir
clifford
because
he
was
lord
of
the
seignories
of
those
parts
sir
clifford’s
whale
has
been
articulated
throughout
so
that
like
a
great
chest
of
drawers
you
can
open
and
shut
him
in
all
his
bony
cavities—spread
out
his
ribs
like
a
gigantic
fan—and
swing
all
day
upon
his
lower
jaw
locks
are
to
be
put
upon
some
of
his
trap-doors
and
shutters
and
a
footman
will
show
round
future
visitors
with
a
bunch
of
keys
at
his
side
sir
clifford
thinks
of
charging
twopence
for
a
peep
at
the
whispering
gallery
in
the
spinal
column
threepence
to
hear
the
echo
in
the
hollow
of
his
cerebellum
and
sixpence
for
the
unrivalled
view
from
his
forehead
the
skeleton
dimensions
i
shall
now
proceed
to
set
down
are
copied
verbatim
from
my
right
arm
where
i
had
them
tattooed
as
in
my
wild
wanderings
at
that
period
there
was
no
other
secure
way
of
preserving
such
valuable
statistics
but
as
i
was
crowded
for
space
and
wished
the
other
parts
of
my
body
to
remain
a
blank
page
for
a
poem
i
was
then
composing—at
least
what
untattooed
parts
might
remain—i
did
not
trouble
myself
with
the
odd
inches
nor
indeed
should
inches
at
all
enter
into
a
congenial
admeasurement
of
the
whale
chapter
103
measurement
of
the
whale’s
skeleton
in
the
first
place
i
wish
to
lay
before
you
a
particular
plain
statement
touching
the
living
bulk
of
this
leviathan
whose
skeleton
we
are
briefly
to
exhibit
such
a
statement
may
prove
useful
here
according
to
a
careful
calculation
i
have
made
and
which
i
partly
base
upon
captain
scoresby’s
estimate
of
seventy
tons
for
the
largest
sized
greenland
whale
of
sixty
feet
in
length
according
to
my
careful
calculation
i
say
a
sperm
whale
of
the
largest
magnitude
between
eighty-five
and
ninety
feet
in
length
and
something
less
than
forty
feet
in
its
fullest
circumference
such
a
whale
will
weigh
at
least
ninety
tons
so
that
reckoning
thirteen
men
to
a
ton
he
would
considerably
outweigh
the
combined
population
of
a
whole
village
of
one
thousand
one
hundred
inhabitants
think
you
not
then
that
brains
like
yoked
cattle
should
be
put
to
this
leviathan
to
make
him
at
all
budge
to
any
landsman’s
imagination
having
already
in
various
ways
put
before
you
his
skull
spout-hole
jaw
teeth
tail
forehead
fins
and
divers
other
parts
i
shall
now
simply
point
out
what
is
most
interesting
in
the
general
bulk
of
his
unobstructed
bones
but
as
the
colossal
skull
embraces
so
very
large
a
proportion
of
the
entire
extent
of
the
skeleton
as
it
is
by
far
the
most
complicated
part
and
as
nothing
is
to
be
repeated
concerning
it
in
this
chapter
you
must
not
fail
to
carry
it
in
your
mind
or
under
your
arm
as
we
proceed
otherwise
you
will
not
gain
a
complete
notion
of
the
general
structure
we
are
about
to
view
in
length
the
sperm
whale’s
skeleton
at
tranque
measured
seventy-two
feet
so
that
when
fully
invested
and
extended
in
life
he
must
have
been
ninety
feet
long
for
in
the
whale
the
skeleton
loses
about
one
fifth
in
length
compared
with
the
living
body
of
this
seventy-two
feet
his
skull
and
jaw
comprised
some
twenty
feet
leaving
some
fifty
feet
of
plain
back-bone
attached
to
this
back-bone
for
something
less
than
a
third
of
its
length
was
the
mighty
circular
basket
of
ribs
which
once
enclosed
his
vitals
to
me
this
vast
ivory-ribbed
chest
with
the
long
unrelieved
spine
extending
far
away
from
it
in
a
straight
line
not
a
little
resembled
the
hull
of
a
great
ship
new-laid
upon
the
stocks
when
only
some
twenty
of
her
naked
bow-ribs
are
inserted
and
the
keel
is
otherwise
for
the
time
but
a
long
disconnected
timber
the
ribs
were
ten
on
a
side
the
first
to
begin
from
the
neck
was
nearly
six
feet
long
the
second
third
and
fourth
were
each
successively
longer
till
you
came
to
the
climax
of
the
fifth
or
one
of
the
middle
ribs
which
measured
eight
feet
and
some
inches
from
that
part
the
remaining
ribs
diminished
till
the
tenth
and
last
only
spanned
five
feet
and
some
inches
in
general
thickness
they
all
bore
a
seemly
correspondence
to
their
length
the
middle
ribs
were
the
most
arched
in
some
of
the
arsacides
they
are
used
for
beams
whereon
to
lay
footpath
bridges
over
small
streams
in
considering
these
ribs
i
could
not
but
be
struck
anew
with
the
circumstance
so
variously
repeated
in
this
book
that
the
skeleton
of
the
whale
is
by
no
means
the
mould
of
his
invested
form
the
largest
of
the
tranque
ribs
one
of
the
middle
ones
occupied
that
part
of
the
fish
which
in
life
is
greatest
in
depth
now
the
greatest
depth
of
the
invested
body
of
this
particular
whale
must
have
been
at
least
sixteen
feet
whereas
the
corresponding
rib
measured
but
little
more
than
eight
feet
so
that
this
rib
only
conveyed
half
of
the
true
notion
of
the
living
magnitude
of
that
part
besides
for
some
way
where
i
now
saw
but
a
naked
spine
all
that
had
been
once
wrapped
round
with
tons
of
added
bulk
in
flesh
muscle
blood
and
bowels
still
more
for
the
ample
fins
i
here
saw
but
a
few
disordered
joints
and
in
place
of
the
weighty
and
majestic
but
boneless
flukes
an
utter
blank
how
vain
and
foolish
then
thought
i
for
timid
untravelled
man
to
try
to
comprehend
aright
this
wondrous
whale
by
merely
poring
over
his
dead
attenuated
skeleton
stretched
in
this
peaceful
wood
no
only
in
the
heart
of
quickest
perils
only
when
within
the
eddyings
of
his
angry
flukes
only
on
the
profound
unbounded
sea
can
the
fully
invested
whale
be
truly
and
livingly
found
out
but
the
spine
for
that
the
best
way
we
can
consider
it
is
with
a
crane
to
pile
its
bones
high
up
on
end
no
speedy
enterprise
but
now
it’s
done
it
looks
much
like
pompey’s
pillar
there
are
forty
and
odd
vertebræ
in
all
which
in
the
skeleton
are
not
locked
together
they
mostly
lie
like
the
great
knobbed
blocks
on
a
gothic
spire
forming
solid
courses
of
heavy
masonry
the
largest
a
middle
one
is
in
width
something
less
than
three
feet
and
in
depth
more
than
four
the
smallest
where
the
spine
tapers
away
into
the
tail
is
only
two
inches
in
width
and
looks
something
like
a
white
billiard-ball
i
was
told
that
there
were
still
smaller
ones
but
they
had
been
lost
by
some
little
cannibal
urchins
the
priest’s
children
who
had
stolen
them
to
play
marbles
with
thus
we
see
how
that
the
spine
of
even
the
hugest
of
living
things
tapers
off
at
last
into
simple
child’s
play

the
fossil
whale
from
his
mighty
bulk
the
whale
affords
a
most
congenial
theme
whereon
to
enlarge
amplify
and
generally
expatiate
would
you
you
could
not
compress
him
by
good
rights
he
should
only
be
treated
of
in
imperial
folio
not
to
tell
over
again
his
furlongs
from
spiracle
to
tail
and
the
yards
he
measures
about
the
waist
only
think
of
the
gigantic
involutions
of
his
intestines
where
they
lie
in
him
like
great
cables
and
hawsers
coiled
away
in
the
subterranean
orlop-deck
of
a
line-of-battle-ship
since
i
have
undertaken
to
manhandle
this
leviathan
it
behooves
me
to
approve
myself
omnisciently
exhaustive
in
the
enterprise
not
overlooking
the
minutest
seminal
germs
of
his
blood
and
spinning
him
out
to
the
uttermost
coil
of
his
bowels
having
already
described
him
in
most
of
his
present
habitatory
and
anatomical
peculiarities
it
now
remains
to
magnify
him
in
an
archæological
fossiliferous
and
antediluvian
point
of
view
applied
to
any
other
creature
than
the
leviathan—to
an
ant
or
a
flea—such
portly
terms
might
justly
be
deemed
unwarrantably
grandiloquent
but
when
leviathan
is
the
text
the
case
is
altered
fain
am
i
to
stagger
to
this
emprise
under
the
weightiest
words
of
the
dictionary
and
here
be
it
said
that
whenever
it
has
been
convenient
to
consult
one
in
the
course
of
these
dissertations
i
have
invariably
used
a
huge
quarto
edition
of
johnson
expressly
purchased
for
that
purpose
because
that
famous
lexicographer’s
uncommon
personal
bulk
more
fitted
him
to
compile
a
lexicon
to
be
used
by
a
whale
author
like
me
one
often
hears
of
writers
that
rise
and
swell
with
their
subject
though
it
may
seem
but
an
ordinary
one
how
then
with
me
writing
of
this
leviathan
unconsciously
my
chirography
expands
into
placard
capitals
give
me
a
condor’s
quill
give
me
vesuvius’
crater
for
an
inkstand
friends
hold
my
arms
for
in
the
mere
act
of
penning
my
thoughts
of
this
leviathan
they
weary
me
and
make
me
faint
with
their
outreaching
comprehensiveness
of
sweep
as
if
to
include
the
whole
circle
of
the
sciences
and
all
the
generations
of
whales
and
men
and
mastodons
past
present
and
to
come
with
all
the
revolving
panoramas
of
empire
on
earth
and
throughout
the
whole
universe
not
excluding
its
suburbs
such
and
so
magnifying
is
the
virtue
of
a
large
and
liberal
theme
we
expand
to
its
bulk
to
produce
a
mighty
book
you
must
choose
a
mighty
theme
no
great
and
enduring
volume
can
ever
be
written
on
the
flea
though
many
there
be
who
have
tried
it
ere
entering
upon
the
subject
of
fossil
whales
i
present
my
credentials
as
a
geologist
by
stating
that
in
my
miscellaneous
time
i
have
been
a
stone-mason
and
also
a
great
digger
of
ditches
canals
and
wells
wine-vaults
cellars
and
cisterns
of
all
sorts
likewise
by
way
of
preliminary
i
desire
to
remind
the
reader
that
while
in
the
earlier
geological
strata
there
are
found
the
fossils
of
monsters
now
almost
completely
extinct
the
subsequent
relics
discovered
in
what
are
called
the
tertiary
formations
seem
the
connecting
or
at
any
rate
intercepted
links
between
the
antichronical
creatures
and
those
whose
remote
posterity
are
said
to
have
entered
the
ark
all
the
fossil
whales
hitherto
discovered
belong
to
the
tertiary
period
which
is
the
last
preceding
the
superficial
formations
and
though
none
of
them
precisely
answer
to
any
known
species
of
the
present
time
they
are
yet
sufficiently
akin
to
them
in
general
respects
to
justify
their
taking
rank
as
cetacean
fossils
detached
broken
fossils
of
pre-adamite
whales
fragments
of
their
bones
and
skeletons
have
within
thirty
years
past
at
various
intervals
been
found
at
the
base
of
the
alps
in
lombardy
in
france
in
england
in
scotland
and
in
the
states
of
louisiana
mississippi
and
alabama
among
the
more
curious
of
such
remains
is
part
of
a
skull
which
in
the
year
1779
was
disinterred
in
the
rue
dauphine
in
paris
a
short
street
opening
almost
directly
upon
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
and
bones
disinterred
in
excavating
the
great
docks
of
antwerp
in
napoleon’s
time
cuvier
pronounced
these
fragments
to
have
belonged
to
some
utterly
unknown
leviathanic
species
but
by
far
the
most
wonderful
of
all
cetacean
relics
was
the
almost
complete
vast
skeleton
of
an
extinct
monster
found
in
the
year
1842
on
the
plantation
of
judge
creagh
in
alabama
the
awe-stricken
credulous
slaves
in
the
vicinity
took
it
for
the
bones
of
one
of
the
fallen
angels
the
alabama
doctors
declared
it
a
huge
reptile
and
bestowed
upon
it
the
name
of
basilosaurus
but
some
specimen
bones
of
it
being
taken
across
the
sea
to
owen
the
english
anatomist
it
turned
out
that
this
alleged
reptile
was
a
whale
though
of
a
departed
species
a
significant
illustration
of
the
fact
again
and
again
repeated
in
this
book
that
the
skeleton
of
the
whale
furnishes
but
little
clue
to
the
shape
of
his
fully
invested
body
so
owen
rechristened
the
monster
zeuglodon
and
in
his
paper
read
before
the
london
geological
society
pronounced
it
in
substance
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
creatures
which
the
mutations
of
the
globe
have
blotted
out
of
existence
when
i
stand
among
these
mighty
leviathan
skeletons
skulls
tusks
jaws
ribs
and
vertebræ
all
characterized
by
partial
resemblances
to
the
existing
breeds
of
sea-monsters
but
at
the
same
time
bearing
on
the
other
hand
similar
affinities
to
the
annihilated
antichronical
leviathans
their
incalculable
seniors
i
am
by
a
flood
borne
back
to
that
wondrous
period
ere
time
itself
can
be
said
to
have
begun
for
time
began
with
man
here
saturn’s
grey
chaos
rolls
over
me
and
i
obtain
dim
shuddering
glimpses
into
those
polar
eternities
when
wedged
bastions
of
ice
pressed
hard
upon
what
are
now
the
tropics
and
in
all
the
25,000
miles
of
this
world’s
circumference
not
an
inhabitable
hand’s
breadth
of
land
was
visible
then
the
whole
world
was
the
whale’s
and
king
of
creation
he
left
his
wake
along
the
present
lines
of
the
andes
and
the
himmalehs
who
can
show
a
pedigree
like
leviathan
ahab’s
harpoon
had
shed
older
blood
than
the
pharaoh’s
methuselah
seems
a
school-boy
i
look
round
to
shake
hands
with
shem
i
am
horror-struck
at
this
antemosaic
unsourced
existence
of
the
unspeakable
terrors
of
the
whale
which
having
been
before
all
time
must
needs
exist
after
all
humane
ages
are
over
but
not
alone
has
this
leviathan
left
his
pre-adamite
traces
in
the
stereotype
plates
of
nature
and
in
limestone
and
marl
bequeathed
his
ancient
bust
but
upon
egyptian
tablets
whose
antiquity
seems
to
claim
for
them
an
almost
fossiliferous
character
we
find
the
unmistakable
print
of
his
fin
in
an
apartment
of
the
great
temple
of
denderah
some
fifty
years
ago
there
was
discovered
upon
the
granite
ceiling
a
sculptured
and
painted
planisphere
abounding
in
centaurs
griffins
and
dolphins
similar
to
the
grotesque
figures
on
the
celestial
globe
of
the
moderns
gliding
among
them
old
leviathan
swam
as
of
yore
was
there
swimming
in
that
planisphere
centuries
before
solomon
was
cradled
nor
must
there
be
omitted
another
strange
attestation
of
the
antiquity
of
the
whale
in
his
own
osseous
post-diluvian
reality
as
set
down
by
the
venerable
john
leo
the
old
barbary
traveller
“not
far
from
the
sea-side
they
have
a
temple
the
rafters
and
beams
of
which
are
made
of
whale-bones
for
whales
of
a
monstrous
size
are
oftentimes
cast
up
dead
upon
that
shore
the
common
people
imagine
that
by
a
secret
power
bestowed
by
god
upon
the
temple
no
whale
can
pass
it
without
immediate
death
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
on
either
side
of
the
temple
there
are
rocks
that
shoot
two
miles
into
the
sea
and
wound
the
whales
when
they
light
upon
’em
they
keep
a
whale’s
rib
of
an
incredible
length
for
a
miracle
which
lying
upon
the
ground
with
its
convex
part
uppermost
makes
an
arch
the
head
of
which
cannot
be
reached
by
a
man
upon
a
camel’s
back
this
rib
says
john
leo
is
said
to
have
layn
there
a
hundred
years
before
i
saw
it
their
historians
affirm
that
a
prophet
who
prophesy’d
of
mahomet
came
from
this
temple
and
some
do
not
stand
to
assert
that
the
prophet
jonas
was
cast
forth
by
the
whale
at
the
base
of
the
temple.”
in
this
afric
temple
of
the

whaleman

105
does
the
whale’s
magnitude
diminish?—will
he
perish
inasmuch
then
as
this
leviathan
comes
floundering
down
upon
us
from
the
head-waters
of
the
eternities
it
may
be
fitly
inquired
whether
in
the
long
course
of
his
generations
he
has
not
degenerated
from
the
original
bulk
of
his
sires
but
upon
investigation
we
find
that
not
only
are
the
whales
of
the
present
day
superior
in
magnitude
to
those
whose
fossil
remains
are
found
in
the
tertiary
system
embracing
a
distinct
geological
period
prior
to
man
but
of
the
whales
found
in
that
tertiary
system
those
belonging
to
its
latter
formations
exceed
in
size
those
of
its
earlier
ones
of
all
the
pre-adamite
whales
yet
exhumed
by
far
the
largest
is
the
alabama
one
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
and
that
was
less
than
seventy
feet
in
length
in
the
skeleton
whereas
we
have
already
seen
that
the
tape-measure
gives
seventy-two
feet
for
the
skeleton
of
a
large
sized
modern
whale
and
i
have
heard
on
whalemen’s
authority
that
sperm
whales
have
been
captured
near
a
hundred
feet
long
at
the
time
of
capture
but
may
it
not
be
that
while
the
whales
of
the
present
hour
are
an
advance
in
magnitude
upon
those
of
all
previous
geological
periods
may
it
not
be
that
since
adam’s
time
they
have
degenerated
assuredly
we
must
conclude
so
if
we
are
to
credit
the
accounts
of
such
gentlemen
as
pliny
and
the
ancient
naturalists
generally
for
pliny
tells
us
of
whales
that
embraced
acres
of
living
bulk
and
aldrovandus
of
others
which
measured
eight
hundred
feet
in
length—rope
walks
and
thames
tunnels
of
whales
and
even
in
the
days
of
banks
and
solander
cooke’s
naturalists
we
find
a
danish
member
of
the
academy
of
sciences
setting
down
certain
iceland
whales
reydan-siskur
or
wrinkled
bellies
at
one
hundred
and
twenty
yards
that
is
three
hundred
and
sixty
feet
and
lacépède
the
french
naturalist
in
his
elaborate
history
of
whales
in
the
very
beginning
of
his
work
page
3
sets
down
the
right
whale
at
one
hundred
metres
three
hundred
and
twenty-eight
feet
and
this
work
was
published
so
late
as
a.d
1825
but
will
any
whaleman
believe
these
stories
no
the
whale
of
to-day
is
as
big
as
his
ancestors
in
pliny’s
time
and
if
ever
i
go
where
pliny
is
i
a
whaleman
more
than
he
was
will
make
bold
to
tell
him
so
because
i
cannot
understand
how
it
is
that
while
the
egyptian
mummies
that
were
buried
thousands
of
years
before
even
pliny
was
born
do
not
measure
so
much
in
their
coffins
as
a
modern
kentuckian
in
his
socks
and
while
the
cattle
and
other
animals
sculptured
on
the
oldest
egyptian
and
nineveh
tablets
by
the
relative
proportions
in
which
they
are
drawn
just
as
plainly
prove
that
the
high-bred
stall-fed
prize
cattle
of
smithfield
not
only
equal
but
far
exceed
in
magnitude
the
fattest
of
pharaoh’s
fat
kine
in
the
face
of
all
this
i
will
not
admit
that
of
all
animals
the
whale
alone
should
have
degenerated
but
still
another
inquiry
remains
one
often
agitated
by
the
more
recondite
nantucketers
whether
owing
to
the
almost
omniscient
look-outs
at
the
mast-heads
of
the
whale-ships
now
penetrating
even
through
behring’s
straits
and
into
the
remotest
secret
drawers
and
lockers
of
the
world
and
the
thousand
harpoons
and
lances
darted
along
all
continental
coasts
the
moot
point
is
whether
leviathan
can
long
endure
so
wide
a
chase
and
so
remorseless
a
havoc
whether
he
must
not
at
last
be
exterminated
from
the
waters
and
the
last
whale
like
the
last
man
smoke
his
last
pipe
and
then
himself
evaporate
in
the
final
puff
comparing
the
humped
herds
of
whales
with
the
humped
herds
of
buffalo
which
not
forty
years
ago
overspread
by
tens
of
thousands
the
prairies
of
illinois
and
missouri
and
shook
their
iron
manes
and
scowled
with
their
thunder-clotted
brows
upon
the
sites
of
populous
river-capitals
where
now
the
polite
broker
sells
you

at
a
dollar
an
inch
in
such
a
comparison
an
irresistible
argument
would
seem
furnished
to
show
that
the
hunted
whale
cannot
now
escape
speedy
extinction
but
you
must
look
at
this
matter
in
every
light
though
so
short
a
period
ago—not
a
good
lifetime—the
census
of
the
buffalo
in
illinois
exceeded
the
census
of
men
now
in
london
and
though
at
the
present
day
not
one
horn
or
hoof
of
them
remains
in
all
that
region
and
though
the
cause
of
this
wondrous
extermination
was
the
spear
of
man
yet
the
far
different
nature
of
the
whale-hunt
peremptorily
forbids
so
inglorious
an
end
to
the
leviathan
forty
men
in
one
ship
hunting
the
sperm
whales
for
forty-eight
months
think
they
have
done
extremely
well
and
thank
god
if
at
last
they
carry
home
the
oil
of
forty
fish
whereas
in
the
days
of
the
old
canadian
and
indian
hunters
and
trappers
of
the
west
when
the
far
west
in
whose
sunset
suns
still
rise
was
a
wilderness
and
a
virgin
the
same
number
of
moccasined
men
for
the
same
number
of
months
mounted
on
horse
instead
of
sailing
in
ships
would
have
slain
not
forty
but
forty
thousand
and
more
buffaloes
a
fact
that
if
need
were
could
be
statistically
stated
nor
considered
aright
does
it
seem
any
argument
in
favour
of
the
gradual
extinction
of
the
sperm
whale
for
example
that
in
former
years
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
say
these
leviathans
in
small
pods
were
encountered
much
oftener
than
at
present
and
in
consequence
the
voyages
were
not
so
prolonged
and
were
also
much
more
remunerative
because
as
has
been
elsewhere
noticed
those
whales
influenced
by
some
views
to
safety
now
swim
the
seas
in
immense
caravans
so
that
to
a
large
degree
the
scattered
solitaries
yokes
and
pods
and
schools
of
other
days
are
now
aggregated
into
vast
but
widely
separated
unfrequent
armies
that
is
all
and
equally
fallacious
seems
the
conceit
that
because
the
so-called
whale-bone
whales
no
longer
haunt
many
grounds
in
former
years
abounding
with
them
hence
that
species
also
is
declining
for
they
are
only
being
driven
from
promontory
to
cape
and
if
one
coast
is
no
longer
enlivened
with
their
jets
then
be
sure
some
other
and
remoter
strand
has
been
very
recently
startled
by
the
unfamiliar
spectacle
furthermore
concerning
these
last
mentioned
leviathans
they
have
two
firm
fortresses
which
in
all
human
probability
will
for
ever
remain
impregnable
and
as
upon
the
invasion
of
their
valleys
the
frosty
swiss
have
retreated
to
their
mountains
so
hunted
from
the
savannas
and
glades
of
the
middle
seas
the
whale-bone
whales
can
at
last
resort
to
their
polar
citadels
and
diving
under
the
ultimate
glassy
barriers
and
walls
there
come
up
among
icy
fields
and
floes
and
in
a
charmed
circle
of
everlasting
december
bid
defiance
to
all
pursuit
from
man
but
as
perhaps
fifty
of
these
whale-bone
whales
are
harpooned
for
one
cachalot
some
philosophers
of
the
forecastle
have
concluded
that
this
positive
havoc
has
already
very
seriously
diminished
their
battalions
but
though
for
some
time
past
a
number
of
these
whales
not
less
than
13,000
have
been
annually
slain
on
the
nor’
west
coast
by
the
americans
alone
yet
there
are
considerations
which
render
even
this
circumstance
of
little
or
no
account
as
an
opposing
argument
in
this
matter
natural
as
it
is
to
be
somewhat
incredulous
concerning
the
populousness
of
the
more
enormous
creatures
of
the
globe
yet
what
shall
we
say
to
harto
the
historian
of
goa
when
he
tells
us
that
at
one
hunting
the
king
of
siam
took
4,000
elephants
that
in
those
regions
elephants
are
numerous
as
droves
of
cattle
in
the
temperate
climes
and
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
if
these
elephants
which
have
now
been
hunted
for
thousands
of
years
by
semiramis
by
porus
by
hannibal
and
by
all
the
successive
monarchs
of
the
east—if
they
still
survive
there
in
great
numbers
much
more
may
the
great
whale
outlast
all
hunting
since
he
has
a
pasture
to
expatiate
in
which
is
precisely
twice
as
large
as
all
asia
both
americas
europe
and
africa
new
holland
and
all
the
isles
of
the
sea
combined
moreover
we
are
to
consider
that
from
the
presumed
great
longevity
of
whales
their
probably
attaining
the
age
of
a
century
and
more
therefore
at
any
one
period
of
time
several
distinct
adult
generations
must
be
contemporary
and
what
that
is
we
may
soon
gain
some
idea
of
by
imagining
all
the
grave-yards
cemeteries
and
family
vaults
of
creation
yielding
up
the
live
bodies
of
all
the
men
women
and
children
who
were
alive
seventy-five
years
ago
and
adding
this
countless
host
to
the
present
human
population
of
the
globe
wherefore
for
all
these
things
we
account
the
whale
immortal
in
his
species
however
perishable
in
his
individuality
he
swam
the
seas
before
the
continents
broke
water
he
once
swam
over
the
site
of
the
tuileries
and
windsor
castle
and
the
kremlin
in
noah’s
flood
he
despised
noah’s
ark
and
if
ever
the
world
is
to
be
again
flooded
like
the
netherlands
to
kill
off
its
rats
then
the
eternal
whale
will
still
survive
and
rearing
upon
the
topmost
crest
of
the
equatorial
flood
spout
his
frothed
defiance
to
the
skies

106
ahab’s
leg
the
precipitating
manner
in
which
captain
ahab
had
quitted
the
samuel
enderby
of
london
had
not
been
unattended
with
some
small
violence
to
his
own
person
he
had
lighted
with
such
energy
upon
a
thwart
of
his
boat
that
his
ivory
leg
had
received
a
half-splintering
shock
and
when
after
gaining
his
own
deck
and
his
own
pivot-hole
there
he
so
vehemently
wheeled
round
with
an
urgent
command
to
the
steersman
it
was
as
ever
something
about
his
not
steering
inflexibly
enough
then
the
already
shaken
ivory
received
such
an
additional
twist
and
wrench
that
though
it
still
remained
entire
and
to
all
appearances
lusty
yet
ahab
did
not
deem
it
entirely
trustworthy
and
indeed
it
seemed
small
matter
for
wonder
that
for
all
his
pervading
mad
recklessness
ahab
did
at
times
give
careful
heed
to
the
condition
of
that
dead
bone
upon
which
he
partly
stood
for
it
had
not
been
very
long
prior
to
the
pequod’s
sailing
from
nantucket
that
he
had
been
found
one
night
lying
prone
upon
the
ground
and
insensible
by
some
unknown
and
seemingly
inexplicable
unimaginable
casualty
his
ivory
limb
having
been
so
violently
displaced
that
it
had
stake-wise
smitten
and
all
but
pierced
his
groin
nor
was
it
without
extreme
difficulty
that
the
agonizing
wound
was
entirely
cured
nor
at
the
time
had
it
failed
to
enter
his
monomaniac
mind
that
all
the
anguish
of
that
then
present
suffering
was
but
the
direct
issue
of
a
former
woe
and
he
too
plainly
seemed
to
see
that
as
the
most
poisonous
reptile
of
the
marsh
perpetuates
his
kind
as
inevitably
as
the
sweetest
songster
of
the
grove
so
equally
with
every
felicity
all
miserable
events
do
naturally
beget
their
like
yea
more
than
equally
thought
ahab
since
both
the
ancestry
and
posterity
of
grief
go
further
than
the
ancestry
and
posterity
of
joy
for
not
to
hint
of
this
that
it
is
an
inference
from
certain
canonic
teachings
that
while
some
natural
enjoyments
here
shall
have
no
children
born
to
them
for
the
other
world
but
on
the
contrary
shall
be
followed
by
the
joy-childlessness
of
all
hell’s
despair
whereas
some
guilty
mortal
miseries
shall
still
fertilely
beget
to
themselves
an
eternally
progressive
progeny
of
griefs
beyond
the
grave
not
at
all
to
hint
of
this
there
still
seems
an
inequality
in
the
deeper
analysis
of
the
thing
for
thought
ahab
while
even
the
highest
earthly
felicities
ever
have
a
certain
unsignifying
pettiness
lurking
in
them
but
at
bottom
all
heartwoes
a
mystic
significance
and
in
some
men
an
archangelic
grandeur
so
do
their
diligent
tracings-out
not
belie
the
obvious
deduction
to
trail
the
genealogies
of
these
high
mortal
miseries
carries
us
at
last
among
the
sourceless
primogenitures
of
the
gods
so
that
in
the
face
of
all
the
glad
hay-making
suns
and
soft
cymballing
round
harvest-moons
we
must
needs
give
in
to
this
that
the
gods
themselves
are
not
for
ever
glad
the
ineffaceable
sad
birth-mark
in
the
brow
of
man
is
but
the
stamp
of
sorrow
in
the
signers
unwittingly
here
a
secret
has
been
divulged
which
perhaps
might
more
properly
in
set
way
have
been
disclosed
before
with
many
other
particulars
concerning
ahab
always
had
it
remained
a
mystery
to
some
why
it
was
that
for
a
certain
period
both
before
and
after
the
sailing
of
the
pequod
he
had
hidden
himself
away
with
such
grand-lama-like
exclusiveness
and
for
that
one
interval
sought
speechless
refuge
as
it
were
among
the
marble
senate
of
the
dead
captain
peleg’s
bruited
reason
for
this
thing
appeared
by
no
means
adequate
though
indeed
as
touching
all
ahab’s
deeper
part
every
revelation
partook
more
of
significant
darkness
than
of
explanatory
light
but
in
the
end
it
all
came
out
this
one
matter
did
at
least
that
direful
mishap
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
temporary
recluseness
and
not
only
this
but
to
that
ever-contracting
dropping
circle
ashore
who
for
any
reason
possessed
the
privilege
of
a
less
banned
approach
to
him
to
that
timid
circle
the
above
hinted
casualty—remaining
as
it
did
moodily
unaccounted
for
by
ahab—invested
itself
with
terrors
not
entirely
underived
from
the
land
of
spirits
and
of
wails
so
that
through
their
zeal
for
him
they
had
all
conspired
so
far
as
in
them
lay
to
muffle
up
the
knowledge
of
this
thing
from
others
and
hence
it
was
that
not
till
a
considerable
interval
had
elapsed
did
it
transpire
upon
the
pequod’s
decks
but
be
all
this
as
it
may
let
the
unseen
ambiguous
synod
in
the
air
or
the
vindictive
princes
and
potentates
of
fire
have
to
do
or
not
with
earthly
ahab
yet
in
this
present
matter
of
his
leg
he
took
plain
practical
procedures;—he
called
the
carpenter
and
when
that
functionary
appeared
before
him
he
bade
him
without
delay
set
about
making
a
new
leg
and
directed
the
mates
to
see
him
supplied
with
all
the
studs
and
joists
of
jaw-ivory
sperm
whale
which
had
thus
far
been
accumulated
on
the
voyage
in
order
that
a
careful
selection
of
the
stoutest
clearest-grained
stuff
might
be
secured
this
done
the
carpenter
received
orders
to
have
the
leg
completed
that
night
and
to
provide
all
the
fittings
for
it
independent
of
those
pertaining
to
the
distrusted
one
in
use
moreover
the
ship’s
forge
was
ordered
to
be
hoisted
out
of
its
temporary
idleness
in
the
hold
and
to
accelerate
the
affair
the
blacksmith
was
commanded
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
forging
of
whatever
iron
contrivances
might
be
needed

the
carpenter
seat
thyself
sultanically
among
the
moons
of
saturn
and
take
high
abstracted
man
alone
and
he
seems
a
wonder
a
grandeur
and
a
woe
but
from
the
same
point
take
mankind
in
mass
and
for
the
most
part
they
seem
a
mob
of
unnecessary
duplicates
both
contemporary
and
hereditary
but
most
humble
though
he
was
and
far
from
furnishing
an
example
of
the
high
humane
abstraction
the
pequod’s
carpenter
was
no
duplicate
hence
he
now
comes
in
person
on
this
stage
like
all
sea-going
ship
carpenters
and
more
especially
those
belonging
to
whaling
vessels
he
was
to
a
certain
off-handed
practical
extent
alike
experienced
in
numerous
trades
and
callings
collateral
to
his
own
the
carpenter’s
pursuit
being
the
ancient
and
outbranching
trunk
of
all
those
numerous
handicrafts
which
more
or
less
have
to
do
with
wood
as
an
auxiliary
material
but
besides
the
application
to
him
of
the
generic
remark
above
this
carpenter
of
the
pequod
was
singularly
efficient
in
those
thousand
nameless
mechanical
emergencies
continually
recurring
in
a
large
ship
upon
a
three
or
four
years’
voyage
in
uncivilized
and
far-distant
seas
for
not
to
speak
of
his
readiness
in
ordinary
duties:—repairing
stove
boats
sprung
spars
reforming
the
shape
of
clumsy-bladed
oars
inserting
bull’s
eyes
in
the
deck
or
new
tree-nails
in
the
side
planks
and
other
miscellaneous
matters
more
directly
pertaining
to
his
special
business
he
was
moreover
unhesitatingly
expert
in
all
manner
of
conflicting
aptitudes
both
useful
and
capricious
the
one
grand
stage
where
he
enacted
all
his
various
parts
so
manifold
was
his
vice-bench
a
long
rude
ponderous
table
furnished
with
several
vices
of
different
sizes
and
both
of
iron
and
of
wood
at
all
times
except
when
whales
were
alongside
this
bench
was
securely
lashed
athwartships
against
the
rear
of
the
try-works
a
belaying
pin
is
found
too
large
to
be
easily
inserted
into
its
hole
the
carpenter
claps
it
into
one
of
his
ever-ready
vices
and
straightway
files
it
smaller
a

out

clapping

the
poor
fellow
unmanageably
winces
under
the
unconcluded
operation
whirling
round
the
handle
of
his
wooden
vice
the
carpenter
signs
him
to
clap
his
jaw
in
that
if
he
would
have
him
draw
the
tooth
thus
this
carpenter
was
prepared
at
all
points
and
alike
indifferent
and
without
respect
in
all
teeth
he
accounted
bits
of
ivory
heads
he
deemed
but
top-blocks
men
themselves
he
lightly
held
for
capstans
but
while
now
upon
so
wide
a
field
thus
variously
accomplished
and
with
such
liveliness
of
expertness
in
him
too
all
this
would
seem
to
argue
some
uncommon
vivacity
of
intelligence
but
not
precisely
so
for
nothing
was
this
man
more
remarkable
than
for
a
certain
impersonal
stolidity
as
it
were
impersonal
i
say
for
it
so
shaded
off
into
the
surrounding
infinite
of
things
that
it
seemed
one
with
the
general
stolidity
discernible
in
the
whole
visible
world
which
while
pauselessly
active
in
uncounted
modes
still
eternally
holds
its
peace
and
ignores
you
though
you
dig
foundations
for
cathedrals
yet
was
this
half-horrible
stolidity
in
him
involving
too
as
it
appeared
an
all-ramifying
heartlessness;—yet
was
it
oddly
dashed
at
times
with
an
old
crutch-like
antediluvian
wheezing
humorousness
not
unstreaked
now
and
then
with
a
certain
grizzled
wittiness
such
as
might
have
served
to
pass
the
time
during
the
midnight
watch
on
the
bearded
forecastle
of
noah’s
ark
was
it
that
this
old
carpenter
had
been
a
life-long
wanderer
whose
much
rolling
to
and
fro
not
only
had
gathered
no
moss
but
what
is
more
had
rubbed
off
whatever
small
outward
clingings
might
have
originally
pertained
to
him
he
was
a
stript
abstract
an
unfractioned
integral
uncompromised
as
a
new-born
babe
living
without
premeditated
reference
to
this
world
or
the
next
you
might
almost
say
that
this
strange
uncompromisedness
in
him
involved
a
sort
of
unintelligence
for
in
his
numerous
trades
he
did
not
seem
to
work
so
much
by
reason
or
by
instinct
or
simply
because
he
had
been
tutored
to
it
or
by
any
intermixture
of
all
these
even
or
uneven
but
merely
by
a
kind
of
deaf
and
dumb
spontaneous
literal
process
he
was
a
pure
manipulator
his
brain
if
he
had
ever
had
one
must
have
early
oozed
along
into
the
muscles
of
his
fingers
he
was
like
one
of
those
unreasoning
but
still
highly
useful
_multum
in
parvo_
sheffield
contrivances
assuming
the
exterior—though
a
little
swelled—of
a
common
pocket
knife
but
containing
not
only
blades
of
various
sizes
but
also
screw-drivers
cork-screws
tweezers
awls
pens
rulers
nail-filers
countersinkers
so
if
his
superiors
wanted
to
use
the
carpenter
for
a
screw-driver
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
open
that
part
of
him
and
the
screw
was
fast
or
if
for
tweezers
take
him
up
by
the
legs
and
there
they
were
yet
as
previously
hinted
this
omnitooled
open-and-shut
carpenter
was
after
all
no
mere
machine
of
an
automaton
if
he
did
not
have
a
common
soul
in
him
he
had
a
subtle
something
that
somehow
anomalously
did
its
duty
what
that
was
whether
essence
of
quicksilver
or
a
few
drops
of
hartshorn
there
is
no
telling
but
there
it
was
and
there
it
had
abided
for
now
some
sixty
years
or
more
and
this
it
was
this
same
unaccountable
cunning
life-principle
in
him
this
it
was
that
kept
him
a
great
part
of
the
time
soliloquizing
but
only
like
an
unreasoning
wheel
which
also
hummingly
soliloquizes
or
rather
his
body
was
a
sentry-box
and
this
soliloquizer
on
guard
there
and
talking
all
the
time
to
keep
himself

he

i
do

a

meaning
thing
that
that
old

prometheus
who
made

they
say
should
have
been
a

animated
them
with
fire
for
what’s

well
for

when

i

another

in

with
it
that
is

my
old
lost
leg
the
flesh

one
i

canst
thou
not
drive
that
old
adam
away
truly
sir
i
begin
to
understand
somewhat
now
yes
i
have
heard
something
curious
on
that
score
sir
how
that
a
dismasted
man
never
entirely
loses
the
feeling
of
his
old
spar
but
it
will
be
still

him
at

may
i
humbly
ask
if
it
be
really
so
sir
it
is

look
put
thy

leg
here
in
the

where
mine
once
was

now
here
is

the

thou
feelest

exactly
there
there
to
a

do
i
is’t
a
riddle
i
should
humbly
call
it
a

then
how
dost
thou
know
that
some
entire
living
thinking
thing
may
not
be
invisibly
and
uninterpenetratingly
standing
precisely
where
thou
now
standest
aye
and
standing
there
in
thy
spite
in
thy
most
solitary
hours
then
dost
thou
not
fear
eavesdroppers
hold
don’t
speak
and
if
i
still
feel
the
smart
of
my
crushed
leg
though
it
be
now
so
long
dissolved
then
why
mayst
not
thou
carpenter
feel
the
fiery
pains
of
hell
for
ever
and
without
a
body
hah
good

truly

if
it
comes
to
that

i

ye

ahab
and
starbuck
in
the
cabin
according
to
usage
they
were
pumping
the
ship
next
morning
and
lo
no
inconsiderable
oil
came
up
with
the
water
the
casks
below
must
have
sprung
a
bad
leak
much
concern
was
shown
and
starbuck
went
down
into
the
cabin
to
report
this
unfavourable
affair.*
*in
sperm-whalemen
with
any
considerable
quantity
of
oil
on
board
it
is
a
regular
semi-weekly
duty
to
conduct
a
hose
into
the
hold
and
drench
the
casks
with
sea-water
which
afterwards
at
varying
intervals
is
removed
by
the
ship’s
pumps
hereby
the
casks
are
sought
to
be
kept
damply
tight
while
by
the
changed
character
of
the
withdrawn
water
the
mariners
readily
detect
any
serious
leakage
in
the
precious
cargo
now
from
the
south
and
west
the
pequod
was
drawing
nigh
to
formosa
and
the
bashee
isles
between
which
lies
one
of
the
tropical
outlets
from
the
china
waters
into
the
pacific
and
so
starbuck
found
ahab
with
a
general
chart
of
the
oriental
archipelagoes
spread
before
him
and
another
separate
one
representing
the
long
eastern
coasts
of
the
japanese
islands—niphon
matsmai
and
sikoke
with
his
snow-white
new
ivory
leg
braced
against
the
screwed
leg
of
his
table
and
with
a
long
pruning-hook
of
a
jack-knife
in
his
hand
the
wondrous
old
man
with
his
back
to
the
gangway
door
was
wrinkling
his
brow
and
tracing
his
old
courses
again
“who’s
there?”
hearing
the
footstep
at
the
door
but
not
turning
round
to
it
“on
deck
begone!”
“captain
ahab
mistakes
it
is
i
the
oil
in
the
hold
is
leaking
sir
we
must
up
burtons
and
break
out.”
“up
burtons
and
break
out
now
that
we
are
nearing
japan
heave-to
here
for
a
week
to
tinker
a
parcel
of
old
hoops?”
“either
do
that
sir
or
waste
in
one
day
more
oil
than
we
may
make
good
in
a
year
what
we
come
twenty
thousand
miles
to
get
is
worth
saving
sir.”
“so
it
is
so
it
is
if
we
get
it.”
“i
was
speaking
of
the
oil
in
the
hold
sir.”
“and
i
was
not
speaking
or
thinking
of
that
at
all
begone
let
it
leak
i’m
all
aleak
myself
aye
leaks
in
leaks
not
only
full
of
leaky
casks
but
those
leaky
casks
are
in
a
leaky
ship
and
that’s
a
far
worse
plight
than
the
pequod’s
man
yet
i
don’t
stop
to
plug
my
leak
for
who
can
find
it
in
the
deep-loaded
hull
or
how
hope
to
plug
it
even
if
found
in
this
life’s
howling
gale
starbuck
i’ll
not
have
the
burtons
hoisted.”
“what
will
the
owners
say
sir?”
“let
the
owners
stand
on
nantucket
beach
and
outyell
the
typhoons
what
cares
ahab
owners
owners
thou
art
always
prating
to
me
starbuck
about
those
miserly
owners
as
if
the
owners
were
my
conscience
but
look
ye
the
only
real
owner
of
anything
is
its
commander
and
hark
ye
my
conscience
is
in
this
ship’s
keel.—on
deck!”
“captain
ahab,”
said
the
reddening
mate
moving
further
into
the
cabin
with
a
daring
so
strangely
respectful
and
cautious
that
it
almost
seemed
not
only
every
way
seeking
to
avoid
the
slightest
outward
manifestation
of
itself
but
within
also
seemed
more
than
half
distrustful
of
itself
“a
better
man
than
i
might
well
pass
over
in
thee
what
he
would
quickly
enough
resent
in
a
younger
man
aye
and
in
a
happier
captain
ahab.”
“devils
dost
thou
then
so
much
as
dare
to
critically
think
of
me?—on
deck!”
“nay
sir
not
yet
i
do
entreat
and
i
do
dare
sir—to
be
forbearing
shall
we
not
understand
each
other
better
than
hitherto
captain
ahab?”
ahab
seized
a
loaded
musket
from
the
rack
forming
part
of
most
south-sea-men’s
cabin
furniture
and
pointing
it
towards
starbuck
exclaimed
“there
is
one
god
that
is
lord
over
the
earth
and
one
captain
that
is
lord
over
the
pequod.—on
deck!”
for
an
instant
in
the
flashing
eyes
of
the
mate
and
his
fiery
cheeks
you
would
have
almost
thought
that
he
had
really
received
the
blaze
of
the
levelled
tube
but
mastering
his
emotion
he
half
calmly
rose
and
as
he
quitted
the
cabin
paused
for
an
instant
and
said
“thou
hast
outraged
not
insulted
me
sir
but
for
that
i
ask
thee
not
to
beware
of
starbuck
thou
wouldst
but
laugh
but
let
ahab
beware
of
ahab
beware
of
thyself
old
man.”
“he
waxes
brave
but
nevertheless
obeys
most
careful
bravery
that!”
murmured
ahab
as
starbuck
disappeared
“what’s
that
he
said—ahab
beware
of
ahab—there’s
something
there!”
then
unconsciously
using
the
musket
for
a

with
an
iron
brow
he
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
little
cabin
but
presently
the
thick
plaits
of
his
forehead
relaxed
and
returning
the
gun
to
the
rack
he
went
to
the
deck
“thou
art
but
too
good
a
fellow
starbuck,”
he
said
lowly
to
the
mate
then
raising
his
voice
to
the
crew
“furl
the
t’gallant-sails
and
close-reef
the
top-sails
fore
and
aft
back
the
main-yard
up
burton
and
break
out
in
the
main-hold.”
it
were
perhaps
vain
to
surmise
exactly
why
it
was
that
as
respecting
starbuck
ahab
thus
acted
it
may
have
been
a
flash
of
honesty
in
him
or
mere
prudential
policy
which
under
the
circumstance
imperiously
forbade
the
slightest
symptom
of
open
disaffection
however
transient
in
the
important
chief
officer
of
his
ship
however
it
was
his
orders
were
executed
and
the

queequeg
in
his
coffin
upon
searching
it
was
found
that
the
casks
last
struck
into
the
hold
were
perfectly
sound
and
that
the
leak
must
be
further
off
so
it
being
calm
weather
they
broke
out
deeper
and
deeper
disturbing
the
slumbers
of
the
huge
ground-tier
butts
and
from
that
black
midnight
sending
those
gigantic
moles
into
the
daylight
above
so
deep
did
they
go
and
so
ancient
and
corroded
and
weedy
the
aspect
of
the
lowermost
puncheons
that
you
almost
looked
next
for
some
mouldy
corner-stone
cask
containing
coins
of
captain
noah
with
copies
of
the
posted
placards
vainly
warning
the
infatuated
old
world
from
the
flood
tierce
after
tierce
too
of
water
and
bread
and
beef
and
shooks
of
staves
and
iron
bundles
of
hoops
were
hoisted
out
till
at
last
the
piled
decks
were
hard
to
get
about
and
the
hollow
hull
echoed
under
foot
as
if
you
were
treading
over
empty
catacombs
and
reeled
and
rolled
in
the
sea
like
an
air-freighted
demijohn
top-heavy
was
the
ship
as
a
dinnerless
student
with
all
aristotle
in
his
head
well
was
it
that
the
typhoons
did
not
visit
them
then
now
at
this
time
it
was
that
my
poor
pagan
companion
and
fast
bosom-friend
queequeg
was
seized
with
a
fever
which
brought
him
nigh
to
his
endless
end
be
it
said
that
in
this
vocation
of
whaling
sinecures
are
unknown
dignity
and
danger
go
hand
in
hand
till
you
get
to
be
captain
the
higher
you
rise
the
harder
you
toil
so
with
poor
queequeg
who
as
harpooneer
must
not
only
face
all
the
rage
of
the
living
whale
but—as
we
have
elsewhere
seen—mount
his
dead
back
in
a
rolling
sea
and
finally
descend
into
the
gloom
of
the
hold
and
bitterly
sweating
all
day
in
that
subterraneous
confinement
resolutely
manhandle
the
clumsiest
casks
and
see
to
their
stowage
to
be
short
among
whalemen
the
harpooneers
are
the
holders
so
called
poor
queequeg
when
the
ship
was
about
half
disembowelled
you
should
have
stooped
over
the
hatchway
and
peered
down
upon
him
there
where
stripped
to
his
woollen
drawers
the
tattooed
savage
was
crawling
about
amid
that
dampness
and
slime
like
a
green
spotted
lizard
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
and
a
well
or
an
ice-house
it
somehow
proved
to
him
poor
pagan
where
strange
to
say
for
all
the
heat
of
his
sweatings
he
caught
a
terrible
chill
which
lapsed
into
a
fever
and
at
last
after
some
days’
suffering
laid
him
in
his
hammock
close
to
the
very
sill
of
the
door
of
death
how
he
wasted
and
wasted
away
in
those
few
long-lingering
days
till
there
seemed
but
little
left
of
him
but
his
frame
and
tattooing
but
as
all
else
in
him
thinned
and
his
cheek-bones
grew
sharper
his
eyes
nevertheless
seemed
growing
fuller
and
fuller
they
became
of
a
strange
softness
of
lustre
and
mildly
but
deeply
looked
out
at
you
there
from
his
sickness
a
wondrous
testimony
to
that
immortal
health
in
him
which
could
not
die
or
be
weakened
and
like
circles
on
the
water
which
as
they
grow
fainter
expand
so
his
eyes
seemed
rounding
and
rounding
like
the
rings
of
eternity
an
awe
that
cannot
be
named
would
steal
over
you
as
you
sat
by
the
side
of
this
waning
savage
and
saw
as
strange
things
in
his
face
as
any
beheld
who
were
bystanders
when
zoroaster
died
for
whatever
is
truly
wondrous
and
fearful
in
man
never
yet
was
put
into
words
or
books
and
the
drawing
near
of
death
which
alike
levels
all
alike
impresses
all
with
a
last
revelation
which
only
an
author
from
the
dead
could
adequately
tell
so
that—let
us
say
it
again—no
dying
chaldee
or
greek
had
higher
and
holier
thoughts
than
those
whose
mysterious
shades
you
saw
creeping
over
the
face
of
poor
queequeg
as
he
quietly
lay
in
his
swaying
hammock
and
the
rolling
sea
seemed
gently
rocking
him
to
his
final
rest
and
the
ocean’s
invisible
flood-tide
lifted
him
higher
and
higher
towards
his
destined
heaven
not
a
man
of
the
crew
but
gave
him
up
and
as
for
queequeg
himself
what
he
thought
of
his
case
was
forcibly
shown
by
a
curious
favour
he
asked
he
called
one
to
him
in
the
grey
morning
watch
when
the
day
was
just
breaking
and
taking
his
hand
said
that
while
in
nantucket
he
had
chanced
to
see
certain
little
canoes
of
dark
wood
like
the
rich
war-wood
of
his
native
isle
and
upon
inquiry
he
had
learned
that
all
whalemen
who
died
in
nantucket
were
laid
in
those
same
dark
canoes
and
that
the
fancy
of
being
so
laid
had
much
pleased
him
for
it
was
not
unlike
the
custom
of
his
own
race
who
after
embalming
a
dead
warrior
stretched
him
out
in
his
canoe
and
so
left
him
to
be
floated
away
to
the
starry
archipelagoes
for
not
only
do
they
believe
that
the
stars
are
isles
but
that
far
beyond
all
visible
horizons
their
own
mild
uncontinented
seas
interflow
with
the
blue
heavens
and
so
form
the
white
breakers
of
the
milky
way
he
added
that
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
being
buried
in
his
hammock
according
to
the
usual
sea-custom
tossed
like
something
vile
to
the
death-devouring
sharks
no
he
desired
a
canoe
like
those
of
nantucket
all
the
more
congenial
to
him
being
a
whaleman
that
like
a
whale-boat
these
coffin-canoes
were
without
a
keel
though
that
involved
but
uncertain
steering
and
much
lee-way
adown
the
dim
ages
now
when
this
strange
circumstance
was
made
known
aft
the
carpenter
was
at
once
commanded
to
do
queequeg’s
bidding
whatever
it
might
include
there
was
some
heathenish
coffin-coloured
old
lumber
aboard
which
upon
a
long
previous
voyage
had
been
cut
from
the
aboriginal
groves
of
the
lackaday
islands
and
from
these
dark
planks
the
coffin
was
recommended
to
be
made
no
sooner
was
the
carpenter
apprised
of
the
order
than
taking
his
rule
he
forthwith
with
all
the
indifferent
promptitude
of
his
character
proceeded
into
the
forecastle
and
took
queequeg’s
measure
with
great
accuracy
regularly
chalking
queequeg’s
person
as
he
shifted
the
rule
“ah
poor
fellow
he’ll
have
to
die
now,”
ejaculated
the
long
island
sailor
going
to
his
vice-bench
the
carpenter
for
convenience
sake
and
general
reference
now
transferringly
measured
on
it
the
exact
length
the
coffin
was
to
be
and
then
made
the
transfer
permanent
by
cutting
two
notches
at
its
extremities
this
done
he
marshalled
the
planks
and
his
tools
and
to
work
when
the
last
nail
was
driven
and
the
lid
duly
planed
and
fitted
he
lightly
shouldered
the
coffin
and
went
forward
with
it
inquiring
whether
they
were
ready
for
it
yet
in
that
direction
overhearing
the
indignant
but
half-humorous
cries
with
which
the
people
on
deck
began
to
drive
the
coffin
away
queequeg
to
every
one’s
consternation
commanded
that
the
thing
should
be
instantly
brought
to
him
nor
was
there
any
denying
him
seeing
that
of
all
mortals
some
dying
men
are
the
most
tyrannical
and
certainly
since
they
will
shortly
trouble
us
so
little
for
evermore
the
poor
fellows
ought
to
be
indulged
leaning
over
in
his
hammock
queequeg
long
regarded
the
coffin
with
an
attentive
eye
he
then
called
for
his
harpoon
had
the
wooden
stock
drawn
from
it
and
then
had
the
iron
part
placed
in
the
coffin
along
with
one
of
the
paddles
of
his
boat
all
by
his
own
request
also
biscuits
were
then
ranged
round
the
sides
within
a
flask
of
fresh
water
was
placed
at
the
head
and
a
small
bag
of
woody
earth
scraped
up
in
the
hold
at
the
foot
and
a
piece
of
sail-cloth
being
rolled
up
for
a
pillow
queequeg
now
entreated
to
be
lifted
into
his
final
bed
that
he
might
make
trial
of
its
comforts
if
any
it
had
he
lay
without
moving
a
few
minutes
then
told
one
to
go
to
his
bag
and
bring
out
his
little
god
yojo
then
crossing
his
arms
on
his
breast
with
yojo
between
he
called
for
the
coffin
lid
hatch
he
called
it
to
be
placed
over
him
the
head
part
turned
over
with
a
leather
hinge
and
there
lay
queequeg
in
his
coffin
with
little
but
his
composed
countenance
in
view
“rarmai”
it
will
do
it
is
easy
he
murmured
at
last
and
signed
to
be
replaced
in
his
hammock
but
ere
this
was
done
pip
who
had
been
slily
hovering
near
by
all
this
while
drew
nigh
to
him
where
he
lay
and
with
soft
sobbings
took
him
by
the
hand
in
the
other
holding
his
tambourine
“poor
rover
will
ye
never
have
done
with
all
this
weary
roving
where
go
ye
now
but
if
the
currents
carry
ye
to
those
sweet
antilles
where
the
beaches
are
only
beat
with
water-lilies
will
ye
do
one
little
errand
for
me
seek
out
one
pip
who’s
now
been
missing
long
i
think
he’s
in
those
far
antilles
if
ye
find
him
then
comfort
him
for
he
must
be
very
sad
for
look
he’s
left
his
tambourine
behind;—i
found
it
rig-a-dig
dig
dig
now
queequeg
die
and
i’ll
beat
ye
your
dying
march.”
“i
have
heard,”
murmured
starbuck
gazing
down
the
scuttle
“that
in
violent
fevers
men
all
ignorance
have
talked
in
ancient
tongues
and
that
when
the
mystery
is
probed
it
turns
out
always
that
in
their
wholly
forgotten
childhood
those
ancient
tongues
had
been
really
spoken
in
their
hearing
by
some
lofty
scholars
so
to
my
fond
faith
poor
pip
in
this
strange
sweetness
of
his
lunacy
brings
heavenly
vouchers
of
all
our
heavenly
homes
where
learned
he
that
but
there?—hark
he
speaks
again
but
more
wildly
now.”
“form
two
and
two
let’s
make
a
general
of
him
ho
where’s
his
harpoon
lay
it
across
here.—rig-a-dig
dig
dig
huzza
oh
for
a
game
cock
now
to
sit
upon
his
head
and
crow
queequeg
dies
game!—mind
ye
that
queequeg
dies
game!—take
ye
good
heed
of
that
queequeg
dies
game
i
say
game
game
game
but
base
little
pip
he
died
a
coward
died
all
a’shiver;—out
upon
pip
hark
ye
if
ye
find
pip
tell
all
the
antilles
he’s
a
runaway
a
coward
a
coward
a
coward
tell
them
he
jumped
from
a
whale-boat
i’d
never
beat
my
tambourine
over
base
pip
and
hail
him
general
if
he
were
once
more
dying
here
no
no
shame
upon
all
cowards—shame
upon
them
let
’em
go
drown
like
pip
that
jumped
from
a
whale-boat
shame
shame!”
during
all
this
queequeg
lay
with
closed
eyes
as
if
in
a
dream
pip
was
led
away
and
the
sick
man
was
replaced
in
his
hammock
but
now
that
he
had
apparently
made
every
preparation
for
death
now
that
his
coffin
was
proved
a
good
fit
queequeg
suddenly
rallied
soon
there
seemed
no
need
of
the
carpenter’s
box
and
thereupon
when
some
expressed
their
delighted
surprise
he
in
substance
said
that
the
cause
of
his
sudden
convalescence
was
this;—at
a
critical
moment
he
had
just
recalled
a
little
duty
ashore
which
he
was
leaving
undone
and
therefore
had
changed
his
mind
about
dying
he
could
not
die
yet
he
averred
they
asked
him
then
whether
to
live
or
die
was
a
matter
of
his
own
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
he
answered
certainly
in
a
word
it
was
queequeg’s
conceit
that
if
a
man
made
up
his
mind
to
live
mere
sickness
could
not
kill
him
nothing
but
a
whale
or
a
gale
or
some
violent
ungovernable
unintelligent
destroyer
of
that
sort
now
there
is
this
noteworthy
difference
between
savage
and
civilized
that
while
a
sick
civilized
man
may
be
six
months
convalescing
generally
speaking
a
sick
savage
is
almost
half-well
again
in
a
day
so
in
good
time
my
queequeg
gained
strength
and
at
length
after
sitting
on
the
windlass
for
a
few
indolent
days
but
eating
with
a
vigorous
appetite
he
suddenly
leaped
to
his
feet
threw
out
his
arms
and
legs
gave
himself
a
good
stretching
yawned
a
little
bit
and
then
springing
into
the
head
of
his
hoisted
boat
and
poising
a
harpoon
pronounced
himself
fit
for
a
fight
with
a
wild
whimsiness
he
now
used
his
coffin
for
a
sea-chest
and
emptying
into
it
his
canvas
bag
of
clothes
set
them
in
order
there
many
spare
hours
he
spent
in
carving
the
lid
with
all
manner
of
grotesque
figures
and
drawings
and
it
seemed
that
hereby
he
was
striving
in
his
rude
way
to
copy
parts
of
the
twisted
tattooing
on
his
body
and
this
tattooing
had
been
the
work
of
a
departed
prophet
and
seer
of
his
island
who
by
those
hieroglyphic
marks
had
written
out
on
his
body
a
complete
theory
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
a
mystical
treatise
on
the
art
of
attaining
truth
so
that
queequeg
in
his
own
proper
person
was
a
riddle
to
unfold
a
wondrous
work
in
one
volume
but
whose
mysteries
not
even
himself
could
read
though
his
own
live
heart
beat
against
them
and
these
mysteries
were
therefore
destined
in
the
end
to
moulder
away
with
the
living
parchment
whereon
they
were
inscribed
and
so
be
unsolved
to
the
last
and
this
thought
it
must
have
been
which
suggested
to
ahab
that
wild
exclamation
of
his
when
one
morning
turning
away
from
surveying
poor
queequeg—“oh
devilish
tantalization
of
the
gods!”

about
this

seem
to

the
blacksmith
availing
himself
of
the
mild
summer-cool
weather
that
now
reigned
in
these
latitudes
and
in
preparation
for
the
peculiarly
active
pursuits
shortly
to
be
anticipated
perth
the
begrimed
blistered
old
blacksmith
had
not
removed
his
portable
forge
to
the
hold
again
after
concluding
his
contributory
work
for
ahab’s
leg
but
still
retained
it
on
deck
fast
lashed
to
ringbolts
by
the
foremast
being
now
almost
incessantly
invoked
by
the
headsmen
and
harpooneers
and
bowsmen
to
do
some
little
job
for
them
altering
or
repairing
or
new
shaping
their
various
weapons
and
boat
furniture
often
he
would
be
surrounded
by
an
eager
circle
all
waiting
to
be
served
holding
boat-spades
pike-heads
harpoons
and
lances
and
jealously
watching
his
every
sooty
movement
as
he
toiled
nevertheless
this
old
man’s
was
a
patient
hammer
wielded
by
a
patient
arm
no
murmur
no
impatience
no
petulance
did
come
from
him
silent
slow
and
solemn
bowing
over
still
further
his
chronically
broken
back
he
toiled
away
as
if
toil
were
life
itself
and
the
heavy
beating
of
his
hammer
the
heavy
beating
of
his
heart
and
so
it
was.—most
miserable
a
peculiar
walk
in
this
old
man
a
certain
slight
but
painful
appearing
yawing
in
his
gait
had
at
an
early
period
of
the
voyage
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
mariners
and
to
the
importunity
of
their
persisted
questionings
he
had
finally
given
in
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
every
one
now
knew
the
shameful
story
of
his
wretched
fate
belated
and
not
innocently
one
bitter
winter’s
midnight
on
the
road
running
between
two
country
towns
the
blacksmith
half-stupidly
felt
the
deadly
numbness
stealing
over
him
and
sought
refuge
in
a
leaning
dilapidated
barn
the
issue
was
the
loss
of
the
extremities
of
both
feet
out
of
this
revelation
part

at

came
out
the
four
acts
of
the
gladness
and
the
one
long
and
as
yet
uncatastrophied
fifth
act
of
the
grief
of
his
life’s
drama
he
was
an
old
man
who
at
the
age
of
nearly
sixty
had
postponedly
encountered
that
thing
in
sorrow’s
technicals
called
ruin
he
had
been
an
artisan
of
famed
excellence
and
with
plenty
to
do
owned
a
house
and
garden
embraced
a
youthful
daughter-like
loving
wife
and
three
blithe
ruddy
children
every
sunday
went
to
a
cheerful-looking
church
planted
in
a
grove
but
one
night
under
cover
of
darkness
and
further
concealed
in
a
most
cunning
disguisement
a
desperate
burglar
slid
into
his
happy
home
and
robbed
them
all
of
everything
and
darker
yet
to
tell
the
blacksmith
himself
did
ignorantly
conduct
this
burglar
into
his
family’s
heart
it
was
the
bottle
conjuror

the
opening
of

fatal
cork

flew
the
fiend

shrivelled
up

most

and
economic
reasons

shop
was
in
the
basement
of
his
dwelling

with
a
separate
entrance
to
it

that

the
young

with
no
unhappy
nervousness

with
vigorous
pleasure
to
the
stout
ringing
of
her
young-armed
old
husband’s
hammer
whose
reverberations
muffled
by
passing
through
the
floors
and
walls
came
up
to
her
not
unsweetly
in
her
nursery
and
so
to
stout
labor’s
iron
lullaby
the
blacksmith’s
infants
were
rocked
to
slumber

woe

death

thou
not

thou
taken
this
old

a
delicious

to
dream
of
in
their
after

death
plucked
down
some
virtuous
elder

whistling
daily
toil

hung
the
responsibilities
of
some
other
family

left

make
him

wife
sat
frozen
at
the
window
with
tearless
eyes
glitteringly
gazing
into
the
weeping
faces
of
her
children

the
forge

up
with
cinders

by

the
forge
with
matted
beard
and
swathed
in
a
bristling
shark-skin
apron
about
mid-day
perth
was
standing
between
his
forge
and

the
latter
placed
upon
an
iron-wood
log
with
one
hand
holding
a
pike-head
in
the
coals
and
with
the
other
at
his
forge’s
lungs
when
captain
ahab
came
along
carrying
in
his
hand
a
small
rusty-looking
leathern
bag
while
yet
a
little
distance
from
the
forge
moody
ahab
paused
till
at
last
perth
withdrawing
his
iron
from
the
fire
began
hammering
it
upon
the
anvil—the
red
mass
sending
off
the
sparks
in
thick
hovering
flights
some
of
which
flew
close
to
ahab
“are
these
thy

of

burn
but
thou—thou
liv’st
among
them
without

scorch.”
“because
i
am
scorched
all
over
captain
ahab,”
answered
perth
resting
for
a
moment
on
his
hammer
“i
am
past
scorching
not
easily
can’st
thou
scorch
a
scar.”
“well
well

thy
shrunk
voice

“welding
an

sir
there
were

and

in

“and
can’st
thou
make
it
all
smooth

after
such
hard
usage
as
it
had?”
“i
think
so

“and
i

thou
can’st
smoothe
almost
any
seams
and

how
hard
the

“aye
sir
i
think
i
can
all

“look
ye
here
then,”
cried
ahab
passionately
advancing
and
leaning
with
both
hands
on
perth’s
shoulders
“look
ye
here—_here_—can
ye
smoothe
out
a
seam
like
this
blacksmith,”
sweeping
one
hand
across
his
ribbed
brow
“if

lay

“oh

jingling
the
leathern
bag
as
if
it
were
full
of
gold
coins
“i
too
want
a
harpoon
made
one
that
a
thousand
yoke
of
fiends
could
not
part
perth
something
that
will
stick
in
a
whale
like
his
own
fin-bone
there’s
the
stuff,”
flinging
the
pouch
upon
the
anvil
“look
ye
blacksmith
these
are
the
gathered
nail-stubbs
of
the
steel
shoes
of
racing
horses.”
“horse-shoe
stubbs
sir
why
captain
ahab
thou
hast
here
then
the
best
and
stubbornest
stuff
we
blacksmiths
ever
work.”
“i
know
it
old
man
these
stubbs
will
weld
together
like
glue
from
the
melted
bones
of
murderers
quick
forge
me
the
harpoon
and
forge
me
first
twelve
rods
for
its
shank
then
wind
and
twist
and
hammer
these
twelve
together
like
the
yarns
and
strands
of
a
tow-line
quick
i’ll
blow
the
fire.”
when
at
last
the
twelve
rods
were
made
ahab
tried
them
one
by
one
by
spiralling
them
with
his
own
hand
round
a
long
heavy
iron
bolt
“a
flaw!”
rejecting
the
last
one
“work
that
over
again
perth.”
this
done
perth
was
about
to
begin
welding
the
twelve
into
one
when
ahab
stayed
his
hand
and
said
he
would
weld
his
own
iron
as
then
with
regular
gasping
hems
he
hammered
on
the
anvil
perth
passing
to
him
the
glowing
rods
one
after
the
other
and
the
hard
pressed
forge
shooting
up
its
intense
straight
flame
the
parsee
passed
silently
and
bowing
over
his
head
towards
the
fire
seemed
invoking
some
curse
or
some
blessing
on
the
toil
but
as
ahab
looked
up
he
slid
aside
“what’s
that
bunch
of
lucifers
dodging
about
there
for?”
muttered
stubb
looking
on
from
the
forecastle
“that
parsee
smells
fire
like
a
fusee
and
smells
of
it
himself
like
a
hot
musket’s
powder-pan.”
at
last
the
shank
in
one
complete
rod
received
its
final
heat
and
as
perth
to
temper
it
plunged
it
all
hissing
into
the
cask
of
water
near
by
the
scalding
steam
shot
up
into
ahab’s
bent
face
“would’st
thou
brand
me
perth?”
wincing
for
a
moment
with
the
pain
“have
i
been
but
forging
my
own
branding-iron
then?”
“pray
god
not
that
yet
i
fear
something
captain
ahab
is
not
this
harpoon
for
the
white
whale?”
“for
the
white
fiend
but
now
for
the
barbs
thou
must
make
them
thyself
man
here
are
my
razors—the
best
of
steel
here
and
make
the
barbs
sharp
as
the
needle-sleet
of
the
icy
sea.”
for
a
moment
the
old
blacksmith
eyed
the
razors
as
though
he
would
fain
not
use
them
“take
them
man
i
have
no
need
for
them
for
i
now
neither
shave
sup
nor
pray
till—but
here—to
work!”
fashioned
at
last
into
an
arrowy
shape
and
welded
by
perth
to
the
shank
the
steel
soon
pointed
the
end
of
the
iron
and
as
the
blacksmith
was
about
giving
the
barbs
their
final
heat
prior
to
tempering
them
he
cried
to
ahab
to
place
the
water-cask
near
“no
no—no
water
for
that
i
want
it
of
the
true
death-temper

what
say
ye
pagans
will
ye
give
me
as
much
blood
as
will
cover
this
barb?”
holding
it
high
up
a
cluster
of
dark
nods
replied
yes
three
punctures
were
made
in
the
heathen
flesh
and
the
white
whale’s
barbs
were
then
tempered
“ego
non
baptizo
te
in
nomine
patris
sed
in
nomine
diaboli!”
deliriously
howled
ahab
as
the
malignant
iron
scorchingly
devoured
the
baptismal
blood
now
mustering
the
spare
poles
from
below
and
selecting
one
of
hickory
with
the
bark
still
investing
it
ahab
fitted
the
end
to
the
socket
of
the
iron
a
coil
of
new
tow-line
was
then
unwound
and
some
fathoms
of
it
taken
to
the
windlass
and
stretched
to
a
great
tension
pressing
his
foot
upon
it
till
the
rope
hummed
like
a
harp-string
then
eagerly
bending
over
it
and
seeing
no
strandings
ahab
exclaimed
“good
and
now
for
the
seizings.”
at
one
extremity
the
rope
was
unstranded
and
the
separate
spread
yarns
were
all
braided
and
woven
round
the
socket
of
the
harpoon
the
pole
was
then
driven
hard
up
into
the
socket
from
the
lower
end
the
rope
was
traced
half-way
along
the
pole’s
length
and
firmly
secured
so
with
intertwistings
of
twine
this
done
pole
iron
and
rope—like
the
three
fates—remained
inseparable
and
ahab
moodily
stalked
away
with
the
weapon
the
sound
of
his
ivory
leg
and
the
sound
of
the
hickory
pole
both
hollowly
ringing
along
every
plank
but
ere
he
entered
his
cabin
light
unnatural
half-bantering
yet
most
piteous
sound
was
heard
oh
pip
thy
wretched
laugh
thy
idle
but
unresting
eye
all
thy
strange
mummeries
not
unmeaningly
blended
with
the
black
tragedy
of
the
melancholy
ship
and
mocked

on

amazing
verdure
the
long-drawn
virgin
vales
the
mild
blue
hill-sides
as
over
these
there
steals
the
hush
the
hum
you
almost
swear
that
play-wearied
children
lie
sleeping
in
these
solitudes
in
some
glad
may-time
when
the
flowers
of
the
woods
are
plucked
and
all
this
mixes
with
your
most
mystic
mood
so
that
fact
and
fancy
half-way
meeting
interpenetrate
and
form
one
seamless
whole
nor
did
such
soothing
scenes
however
temporary
fail
of
at

as
temporary
an
effect
on
ahab
but
if
these
secret
golden
keys
did
seem
to
open
in
him
his
own
secret
golden
treasuries
yet
did
his
breath
upon
them
prove
but
tarnishing
oh
grassy
glades
oh
ever
vernal
endless
landscapes
in
the
soul
in
ye,—though
long
parched
by
the
dead
drought
of
the
earthy
life,—in
ye
men
yet
may
roll
like
young
horses
in
new
morning
clover
and
for
some
few
fleeting
moments
feel
the
cool
dew
of
the
life
immortal
on
them
would
to
god
these
blessed
calms
would
last
but
the
mingled
mingling
threads
of
life
are
woven
by
warp
and
woof
calms
crossed
by
storms
a
storm
for
every
calm
there
is
no
steady
unretracing
progress
in
this
life
we
do
not
advance
through
fixed
gradations
and
at
the
last
one
pause:—through
infancy’s
unconscious
spell
boyhood’s
thoughtless
faith
adolescence’
doubt
the
common
doom
then
scepticism
then
disbelief
resting
at
last
in
manhood’s
pondering
repose
of
if
but
once
gone
through
we
trace
the
round
again
and
are
infants
boys
and
men
and
ifs
eternally
where
lies
the
final
harbor
whence
we
unmoor
no
more
in
what
rapt
ether
sails
the
world
of
which
the
weariest
will
never
weary
where
is
the
foundling’s
father
hidden
our
souls
are
like
those
orphans
whose
unwedded
mothers
die
in
bearing
them
the
secret
of
our
paternity
lies
in
their
grave
and
we
must
there
to
learn
it
and
that
same
day
too
gazing
far
down
from
his
boat’s
side
into
that
same
golden
sea
starbuck
lowly
murmured:—
“loveliness
unfathomable
as
ever
lover
saw
in
his
young
bride’s
eye!—tell
me
not
of
thy
teeth-tiered
sharks
and
thy
kidnapping
cannibal
ways
let
faith
oust
fact
let
fancy
oust
memory
i
look
deep
down
and
do
believe.”
and
stubb
fish-like
with
sparkling
scales
leaped
up
in
that
same
golden
light:—
“i
am
stubb
and
stubb
has
his
history
but
here
stubb
takes
oaths
that
he
has
always
been
jolly!”

the
pequod
meets
the
bachelor
and
jolly
enough
were
the
sights
and
the
sounds
that
came
bearing
down
before
the
wind
some
few
weeks
after
ahab’s
harpoon
had
been
welded
it
was
a
nantucket
ship
the
bachelor
which
had
just
wedged
in
her
last
cask
of
oil
and
bolted
down
her
bursting
hatches
and
now
in
glad
holiday
apparel
was
joyously
though
somewhat
vain-gloriously
sailing
round
among
the
widely-separated
ships
on
the
ground
previous
to
pointing
her
prow
for
home
the
three
men
at
her
mast-head
wore
long
streamers
of
narrow
red
bunting
at
their
hats
from
the
stern
a
whale-boat
was
suspended
bottom
down
and
hanging
captive
from
the
bowsprit
was
seen
the
long
lower
jaw
of
the
last
whale
they
had
slain
signals
ensigns
and
jacks
of
all
colours
were
flying
from
her
rigging
on
every
side
sideways
lashed
in
each
of
her
three
basketed
tops
were
two
barrels
of
sperm
above
which
in
her
top-mast
cross-trees
you
saw
slender
breakers
of
the
same
precious
fluid
and
nailed
to
her
main
truck
was
a
brazen
lamp
as
was
afterwards
learned
the
bachelor
had
met
with
the
most
surprising
success
all
the
more
wonderful
for
that
while
cruising
in
the
same
seas
numerous
other
vessels
had
gone
entire
months
without
securing
a
single
fish
not
only
had
barrels
of
beef
and
bread
been
given
away
to
make
room
for
the
far
more
valuable
sperm
but
additional
supplemental
casks
had
been
bartered
for
from
the
ships
she
had
met
and
these
were
stowed
along
the
deck
and
in
the
captain’s
and
officers’
state-rooms
even
the
cabin
table
itself
had
been
knocked
into
kindling-wood
and
the
cabin
mess
dined
off
the
broad
head
of
an
oil-butt
lashed
down
to
the
floor
for
a
centrepiece
in
the
forecastle
the
sailors
had
actually
caulked
and
pitched
their
chests
and
filled
them
it
was
humorously
added
that
the
cook
had
clapped
a
head
on
his
largest
boiler
and
filled
it
that
the
steward
had
plugged
his
spare
coffee-pot
and
filled
it
that
the
harpooneers
had
headed
the
sockets
of
their
irons
and
filled
them
that
indeed
everything
was
filled
with
sperm
except
the
captain’s
pantaloons
pockets
and
those
he
reserved
to
thrust
his
hands
into
in
self-complacent
testimony
of
his
entire
satisfaction
as
this
glad
ship
of
good
luck
bore
down
upon
the
moody
pequod
the
barbarian
sound
of
enormous
drums
came
from
her
forecastle
and
drawing
still
nearer
a
crowd
of
her
men
were
seen
standing
round
her
huge
try-pots
which
covered
with
the
parchment-like
_poke_
or
stomach
skin
of
the
black
fish
gave
forth
a
loud
roar
to
every
stroke
of
the
clenched
hands
of
the
crew
on
the
quarter-deck
the
mates
and
harpooneers
were
dancing
with
the
olive-hued
girls
who
had
eloped
with
them
from
the
polynesian
isles
while
suspended
in
an
ornamented
boat
firmly
secured
aloft
between
the
foremast
and
mainmast
three
long
island
negroes
with
glittering
fiddle-bows
of
whale
ivory
were
presiding
over
the
hilarious
jig
meanwhile
others
of
the
ship’s
company
were
tumultuously
busy
at
the
masonry
of
the
try-works
from
which
the
huge
pots
had
been
removed
you
would
have
almost
thought
they
were
pulling
down
the
cursed
bastille
such
wild
cries
they
raised
as
the
now
useless
brick
and
mortar
were
being
hurled
into
the
sea
lord
and
master
over
all
this
scene
the
captain
stood
erect
on
the
ship’s
elevated
quarter-deck
so
that
the
whole
rejoicing
drama
was
full
before
him
and
seemed
merely
contrived
for
his
own
individual
diversion
and
ahab
he
too
was
standing
on
his
quarter-deck
shaggy
and
black
with
a
stubborn
gloom
and
as
the
two
ships
crossed
each
other’s
wakes—one
all
jubilations
for
things
passed
the
other
all
forebodings
as
to
things
to
come—their
two
captains
in
themselves
impersonated
the
whole
striking
contrast
of
the
scene
“come
aboard
come
aboard!”
cried
the
gay
bachelor’s
commander
lifting
a
glass
and
a
bottle
in
the
air
“hast
seen
the
white
whale?”
gritted
ahab
in
reply
“no
only
heard
of
him
but
don’t
believe
in
him
at
all,”
said
the
other
good-humoredly
“come
aboard!”
“thou
art
too
damned
jolly
sail
on
hast
lost
any
men?”
“not
enough
to
speak
of—two
islanders
that’s
all;—but
come
aboard
old
hearty
come
along
i’ll
soon
take
that
black
from
your
brow
come
along
will
ye
merry’s
the
play
a
full
ship
and
homeward-bound.”
“how
wondrous
familiar
is
a
fool!”
muttered
ahab
then
aloud
“thou
art
a
full
ship
and
homeward
bound
thou
sayst
well
then
call
me
an
empty
ship
and
outward-bound
so
go
thy
ways
and
i
will
mine
forward
there
set
all
sail
and
keep
her
to
the
wind!”
and
thus
while
the
one
ship
went
cheerily
before
the
breeze
the
other
stubbornly
fought
against
it
and
so
the
two
vessels
parted
the
crew
of
the
pequod
looking
with
grave
lingering
glances
towards
the
receding
bachelor
but
the
bachelor’s
men
never
heeding
their
gaze
for
the
lively
revelry
they
were
in
and
as
ahab
leaning
over
the
taffrail
eyed
the
homeward-bound
craft
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
vial
of
sand
and
then
looking
from
the
ship
to
the
vial
seemed
thereby
bringing
two
remote
associations
together
for
that
vial
was
filled
with
nantucket
soundings

soothed
to

ahab
who
had
sterned
off
from
the
whale
sat
intently
watching
his
final
wanings
from
the
now
tranquil
boat
for
that
strange
spectacle
observable
in
all
sperm
whales
dying—the
turning
sunwards
of
the
head
and
so
expiring—that
strange
spectacle
beheld
of
such
a
placid
evening
somehow
to
ahab
conveyed
a
wondrousness
unknown
before
“he

no

whirls
round

it

some

round
by

in

i

two

up

the

ostentatiously

was

upon

and

seated
in

was
about
taking
his
wonted
daily
observation
of
the

to
determine
his

was
furnished

through

to

so
swinging
his
seated
form
to
the
roll
of
the

and
with
his
astrological-looking

placed
to

he
remained
in
that
posture
for
some
moments
to
catch
the
precise
instant
when
the
sun
should
gain
its
precise
meridian
meantime
while
his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
the
parsee
was
kneeling
beneath
him
on
the
ship’s
deck
and
with
face
thrown
up
like
ahab’s
was
eyeing
the
same
sun
with
him
only
the
lids
of
his
eyes
half
hooded
their
orbs
and
his
wild
face
was
subdued
to
an
earthly
passionlessness
at
length
the
desired
observation
was
taken
and
with
his
pencil
upon
his
ivory
leg
ahab
soon
calculated
what
his
latitude
must
be
at
that
precise
instant
then
falling
into
a
moment’s
revery
he
again
looked
up
towards
the

murmured
to
himself

and
mighty
pilot
thou
tellest
me
truly
where
i
_am_—but
canst
thou
cast
the
least
hint
where
i
_shall_
be
or
canst
thou
tell
where
some
other
thing
besides
me
is
this
moment
living
where
is
moby
dick
this
instant
thou
must
be
eyeing
him
these
eyes
of
mine
look
into
the
very
eye
that
is
even
now
beholding
him
aye
and
into
the
eye
that
is
even
now
equally
beholding
the
objects
on
the
unknown
thither
side
of
thee
thou
sun!”
then
gazing
at
his
quadrant
and
handling
one
after
the
other
its
numerous
cabalistical
contrivances
he
pondered
again
and
muttered
“foolish
toy
babies’
plaything
of
haughty
admirals
and
commodores
and
captains
the
world
brags
of
thee
of
thy
cunning
and
might
but
what
after
all
canst
thou
do
but
tell
the
poor
pitiful
point
where
thou
thyself
happenest
to
be
on
this
wide
planet
and
the
hand
that
holds
thee
no
not
one
jot
more
thou
canst
not
tell
where
one
drop
of
water
or
one
grain
of
sand
will
be
to-morrow
noon
and
yet
with
thy
impotence
thou
insultest
the
sun
science
curse
thee
thou
vain
toy
and
cursed
be
all
the
things
that
cast
man’s
eyes
aloft
to
that
heaven
whose
live
vividness
but
scorches
him
as
these
old
eyes
are
even
now
scorched
with
thy
light
o

by
nature
to
this
earth’s
horizon
are
the
glances
of
man’s
eyes
not
shot
from
the
crown
of
his
head
as
if
god
had
meant
him
to
gaze
on
his

curse
thee
thou
quadrant!”
dashing
it
to
the
deck
“no
longer
will
i
guide
my
earthly
way
by
thee
the

compass
and
the

dead-reckoning
by

_these_

me

my

on

lighting
from
the
boat
to
the
deck
“thus
i
trample
on
thee
thou
paltry
thing
that
feebly
pointest
on
high
thus
i
split
and
destroy
thee!”
as
the
frantic
old
man
thus
spoke
and
thus
trampled
with
his
live
and
dead
feet
a
sneering
triumph
that
seemed
meant
for
ahab
and
a
fatalistic
despair
that
seemed
meant
for
himself—these
passed
over
the
mute
motionless
parsee’s
face
unobserved
he
rose
and
glided
away
while
awestruck
by
the
aspect
of
their
commander
the
seamen
clustered
together
on
the
forecastle
till
ahab
troubledly
pacing
the
deck
shouted
out—“to
the
braces
up
helm!—square
in!”
in
an
instant
the
yards
swung
round
and
as
the
ship
half-wheeled
upon
her
heel
her
three
firm-seated
graceful
masts
erectly
poised
upon
her
long
ribbed
hull
seemed
as
the
three
horatii
pirouetting
on
one
sufficient
steed
standing
between
the
knight-heads
starbuck
watched
the
pequod’s
tumultuous
way
and
ahab’s
also
as
he
went
lurching
along
the
deck
“i
have
sat
before
the
dense
coal
fire
and
watched
it
all
aglow
full
of
its
tormented
flaming
life
and
i
have
seen
it
wane
at
last
down
down
to
dumbest
dust
old
man
of
oceans
of
all
this
fiery
life
of
thine
what
will
at
length
remain
but
one
little
heap
of
ashes!”
“aye,”
cried
stubb
“but
sea-coal
ashes—mind
ye
that
mr
starbuck—sea-coal
not
your
common
charcoal
well
well
i
heard
ahab
mutter
‘here
some
one
thrusts
these
cards
into
these
old
hands
of
mine
swears
that
i
must
play
them

no

and

me
ahab

right

in
the
game
and
die
in
it!”

like

“bad

cried
starbuck
“let

and

here
in

but
if

art

thou
wilt

“but

never

i

i
am
a

and
i
sing

i
tell
you
what
it
is
mr

there’s
no
way
to

my
singing

to

when
that’s

i
sing

“madman
look
through

thou
hast
none
of
thine
own.”
“what
how
can
you
see
better
of
a
dark
night
than
anybody
else
never
mind
how
foolish?”
“here!”
cried
starbuck
seizing
stubb
by
the
shoulder
and
pointing
his
hand
towards
the
weather
bow
“markest
thou
not
that
the

comes
from

the

swung
to
this
day
noon
now
mark
his

there
where
is

in
the

where

“i
don’t

ye
what’s

“yes
yes
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
is
the
shortest
way
to
nantucket,”
soliloquized
starbuck
suddenly
heedless
of
stubb’s
question
“the
gale
that
now
hammers
at
us
to
stave
us
we
can
turn
it
into
a
fair
wind
that
will
drive
us
towards
home
yonder
to
windward
all
is
blackness
of
doom
but
to
leeward
homeward—i
see
it
lightens
up
there
but
not
with
the
lightning.”
at
that
moment
in
one
of
the
intervals
of
profound
darkness
following
the
flashes
a
voice
was
heard
at
his
side
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
volley
of
thunder
peals
rolled
overhead
“who’s
there?”
“old
thunder!”
said
ahab
groping
his
way
along
the
bulwarks
to
his
pivot-hole
but
suddenly
finding
his
path
made
plain
to
him
by
elbowed
lances
of
fire
now
as
the
lightning
rod
to
a
spire
on
shore
is
intended
to
carry
off
the
perilous
fluid
into
the
soil
so
the
kindred
rod
which
at
sea
some
ships
carry
to
each
mast
is
intended
to
conduct
it
into
the
water
but
as
this
conductor
must
descend
to
considerable
depth
that
its
end
may
avoid
all
contact
with
the
hull
and
as
moreover
if
kept
constantly
towing
there
it
would
be
liable
to
many
mishaps
besides
interfering
not
a
little
with
some
of
the
rigging
and
more
or
less
impeding
the
vessel’s
way
in
the
water
because
of
all
this
the
lower
parts
of
a
ship’s
lightning-rods
are
not
always
overboard
but
are
generally
made
in
long
slender
links
so
as
to
be
the
more
readily
hauled
up
into
the
chains
outside
or
thrown
down
into
the
sea
as
occasion
may
require
“the
rods
the
rods!”
cried
starbuck
to
the
crew
suddenly
admonished
to
vigilance
by
the
vivid
lightning
that
had
just
been
darting
flambeaux
to
light
ahab
to
his
post
“are
they
overboard
drop
them
over
fore
and
aft
quick!”
“avast!”
cried
ahab
“let’s
have
fair
play
here
though
we
be
the
weaker
side
yet
i’ll
contribute
to
raise
rods
on
the
himmalehs
and
andes
that
all
the
world
may
be
secured
but
out
on
privileges
let
them
be
sir.”
“look
aloft!”
cried
starbuck
“the
corpusants
the
corpusants!”
all
the
yard-arms
were
tipped
with
a
pallid
fire
and
touched
at
each
tri-pointed
lightning-rod-end
with
three
tapering
white
flames
each
of
the
three
tall
masts
was
silently
burning
in
that
sulphurous
air
like
three
gigantic
wax
tapers
before
an
altar
“blast
the
boat
let
it
go!”
cried
stubb
at
this
instant
as
a
swashing
sea
heaved
up
under
his
own
little
craft
so
that
its
gunwale
violently
jammed
his
hand
as
he
was
passing
a
lashing
“blast
it!”—but
slipping
backward
on
the
deck
his
uplifted
eyes
caught
the
flames
and
immediately
shifting
his
tone
he
cried—“the
corpusants
have
mercy
on
us
all!”
to
sailors
oaths
are
household
words
they
will
swear
in
the
trance
of
the
calm
and
in
the
teeth
of
the
tempest
they
will
imprecate
curses
from
the
topsail-yard-arms
when
most
they
teeter
over
to
a
seething
sea
but
in
all
my
voyagings
seldom
have
i
heard
a
common
oath
when
god’s
burning
finger
has
been
laid
on
the
ship
when
his
“mene
mene
tekel
upharsin”
has
been
woven
into
the
shrouds
and
the
cordage
while
this
pallidness
was
burning
aloft
few
words
were
heard
from
the
enchanted
crew
who
in
one
thick
cluster
stood
on
the
forecastle
all
their
eyes
gleaming
in
that
pale
phosphorescence
like
a
far
away
constellation
of
stars
relieved
against
the
ghostly
light
the
gigantic
jet
negro
daggoo
loomed
up
to
thrice
his
real
stature
and
seemed
the
black
cloud
from
which
the
thunder
had
come
the
parted
mouth
of
tashtego
revealed
his
shark-white
teeth
which
strangely
gleamed
as
if
they
too
had
been
tipped
by
corpusants
while
lit
up
by
the
preternatural
light
queequeg’s
tattooing
burned
like
satanic
blue
flames
on
his
body
the
tableau
all
waned
at
last
with
the
pallidness
aloft
and
once
more
the
pequod
and
every
soul
on
her
decks
were
wrapped
in
a
pall
a
moment
or
two
passed
when
starbuck
going
forward
pushed
against
some
one
it
was
stubb
“what
thinkest
thou
now
man
i
heard
thy
cry
it
was
not
the
same
in
the
song.”
“no
no
it
wasn’t
i
said
the
corpusants
have
mercy
on
us
all
and
i
hope
they
will
still
but
do
they
only
have
mercy
on
long
faces?—have
they
no
bowels
for
a
laugh
and
look
ye
mr
starbuck—but
it’s
too
dark
to
look
hear
me
then
i
take
that
mast-head
flame
we
saw
for
a
sign
of
good
luck
for
those
masts
are
rooted
in
a
hold
that
is
going
to
be
chock
a’
block
with
sperm-oil
d’ye
see
and
so
all
that
sperm
will
work
up
into
the
masts
like
sap
in
a
tree
yes
our
three
masts
will
yet
be
as
three
spermaceti
candles—that’s
the
good
promise
we
saw.”
at
that
moment
starbuck
caught
sight
of
stubb’s
face
slowly
beginning
to
glimmer
into
sight
glancing
upwards
he
cried
“see
see!”
and
once
more
the
high
tapering
flames
were
beheld
with
what
seemed
redoubled
supernaturalness
in
their
pallor
“the
corpusants
have
mercy
on
us
all,”
cried
stubb
again
at
the
base
of
the
mainmast
full
beneath
the
doubloon
and
the
flame
the
parsee
was
kneeling
in
ahab’s
front
but
with
his
head
bowed
away
from
him
while
near
by
from
the
arched
and
overhanging
rigging
where
they
had
just
been
engaged
securing
a
spar
a
number
of
the
seamen
arrested
by
the
glare
now
cohered
together
and
hung
pendulous
like
a
knot
of
numbed
wasps
from
a
drooping
orchard
twig
in
various
enchanted
attitudes
like
the
standing
or
stepping
or
running
skeletons
in
herculaneum
others
remained
rooted
to
the
deck
but
all
their
eyes
upcast
“aye
aye
men!”
cried
ahab
“look
up
at
it
mark
it
well
the
white
flame
but
lights
the
way
to
the
white
whale
hand
me
those
mainmast
links
there
i
would
fain
feel
this
pulse
and
let
mine
beat
against
it
blood
against
fire
so.”
then
turning—the
last
link
held
fast
in
his
left
hand
he
put
his
foot
upon
the
parsee
and
with
fixed
upward
eye
and
high-flung
right
arm
he
stood
erect
before
the
lofty
tri-pointed
trinity
of
flames
“oh
thou
clear
spirit
of
clear
fire
whom
on
these
seas
i
as
persian
once
did
worship
till
in
the
sacramental
act
so
burned
by
thee
that
to
this
hour
i
bear
the
scar
i
now
know
thee
thou
clear
spirit
and
i
now
know
that
thy
right
worship
is
defiance
to
neither
love
nor
reverence
wilt
thou
be
kind
and
e’en
for
hate
thou
canst
but
kill
and
all
are
killed
no
fearless
fool
now
fronts
thee
i
own
thy
speechless
placeless
power
but
to
the
last
gasp
of
my
earthquake
life
will
dispute
its
unconditional
unintegral
mastery
in
me
in
the
midst
of
the
personified
impersonal
a
personality
stands
here
though
but
a
point
at
best
whencesoe’er
i
came
wheresoe’er
i
go
yet
while
i
earthly
live
the
queenly
personality
lives
in
me
and
feels
her
royal
rights
but
war
is
pain
and
hate
is
woe
come
in
thy
lowest
form
of
love
and
i
will
kneel
and
kiss
thee
but
at
thy
highest
come
as
mere
supernal
power
and
though
thou
launchest
navies
of
full-freighted
worlds
there’s
that
in
here
that
still
remains
indifferent
oh
thou
clear
spirit
of
thy
fire

me

breathe
it
back
to
thee.”
_sudden

leap
lengthwise
to

their

ahab
with
the
rest
closes
his

hard
upon

“the

cried
starbuck
“look
at
thy

ahab’s
harpoon
the
one
forged
at
perth’s
fire
remained
firmly
lashed
in
its
conspicuous
crotch
so
that
it
projected
beyond
his
whale-boat’s
bow
but
the
sea
that
had
stove
its
bottom
had
caused
the
loose
leather
sheath
to
drop
off
and
from
the
keen
steel
barb
there
now
came
a
levelled
flame
of
pale
forked
fire
as
the
silent
harpoon
burned
there
like
a
serpent’s
tongue
starbuck
grasped
ahab
by
the
arm—“god
god
is
against
thee
old
man
forbear
’tis
an
ill
voyage
ill
begun

continued

me

voyage

this.”
overhearing
starbuck
the
panic-stricken
crew
instantly
ran
to
the
braces—though
not
a
sail
was
left
aloft
for
the
moment
all
the
aghast
mate’s
thoughts
seemed
theirs
they
raised
a
half
mutinous
cry
but
dashing
the
rattling
lightning
links
to
the
deck
and
snatching
the
burning
harpoon
ahab
waved
it
like
a
torch
among
them
swearing
to
transfix
with
it
the
first
sailor
that
but
cast
loose
a
rope’s
end
petrified
by
his
aspect
and
still
more
shrinking
from
the
fiery
dart
that
he
held
the
men
fell
back
in
dismay
and
ahab
again
spoke:—
“all
your
oaths
to
hunt
the
white
whale
are
as
binding
as
mine
and
heart
soul
and
body

and

that
ye
may
know
to
what

this
heart
beats
look
ye
here
thus
i
blow
out
the
last

and
with
one
blast
of
his
breath
he
extinguished
the
flame
as
in
the
hurricane
that
sweeps
the
plain
men
fly
the
neighborhood
of
some
lone
gigantic
elm

so
at
those
last
words
of
ahab’s
many
of
the
mariners
did
run
from
him
in
a
terror
of
dismay

the
musket
during
the
most
violent
shocks
of
the
typhoon
the
man
at
the
pequod’s
jaw-bone
tiller
had
several
times
been
reelingly
hurled
to
the
deck
by
its
spasmodic
motions
even
though
preventer
tackles
had
been
attached
to
it—for
they
were
slack—because
some
play
to
the
tiller
was
indispensable
in
a
severe
gale
like
this
while
the
ship
is
but
a
tossed
shuttlecock
to
the
blast
it
is
by
no
means
uncommon
to
see
the
needles
in
the
compasses
at
intervals
go
round
and
round
it
was
thus
with
the
pequod’s
at
almost
every
shock
the
helmsman
had
not
failed
to
notice
the
whirling
velocity
with
which
they
revolved
upon
the
cards
it
is
a
sight
that
hardly
anyone
can
behold
without
some
sort
of
unwonted
emotion
some
hours
after
midnight
the
typhoon
abated
so
much
that
through
the
strenuous
exertions
of
starbuck
and
stubb—one
engaged
forward
and
the
other
aft—the
shivered
remnants
of
the
jib
and
fore
and
main-top-sails
were
cut
adrift
from
the
spars
and
went
eddying
away
to
leeward
like
the
feathers
of
an
albatross
which
sometimes
are
cast
to
the
winds
when
that
storm-tossed
bird
is
on
the
wing
the
three
corresponding
new
sails
were
now
bent
and
reefed
and
a
storm-trysail
was
set
further
aft
so
that
the
ship
soon
went
through
the
water
with
some
precision
again
and
the
course—for
the
present
east-south-east—which
he
was
to
steer
if
practicable
was
once
more
given
to
the
helmsman
for
during
the
violence
of
the
gale
he
had
only
steered
according
to
its
vicissitudes
but
as
he
was
now
bringing
the
ship
as
near
her
course
as
possible
watching
the
compass
meanwhile
lo
a
good
sign
the
wind
seemed
coming
round
astern
aye
the
foul
breeze
became
fair
instantly
the
yards
were
squared
to
the
lively
song
of
“_ho
the
fair
wind
oh-ye-ho
cheerly
men!_”
the
crew
singing
for
joy
that
so
promising
an
event
should
so
soon
have
falsified
the
evil
portents
preceding
it
in
compliance
with
the
standing
order
of
his
commander—to
report
immediately
and
at
any
one
of
the
twenty-four
hours
any
decided
change
in
the
affairs
of
the
deck,—starbuck
had
no
sooner
trimmed
the
yards
to
the
breeze—however
reluctantly
and
gloomily,—than
he
mechanically
went
below
to
apprise
captain
ahab
of
the
circumstance
ere
knocking
at
his
state-room
he
involuntarily
paused
before
it
a
moment
the
cabin
lamp—taking
long
swings
this
way
and
that—was
burning
fitfully
and
casting
fitful
shadows
upon
the
old
man’s
bolted
door,—a
thin
one
with
fixed
blinds
inserted
in
place
of
upper
panels
the
isolated
subterraneousness
of
the
cabin
made
a
certain
humming
silence
to
reign
there
though
it
was
hooped
round
by
all
the
roar
of
the
elements
the
loaded
muskets
in
the
rack
were
shiningly
revealed
as
they
stood
upright
against
the
forward
bulkhead
starbuck
was
an
honest
upright
man
but
out
of
starbuck’s
heart
at
that
instant
when
he
saw
the
muskets
there
strangely
evolved
an
evil
thought
but
so
blent
with
its
neutral
or
good
accompaniments
that
for
the
instant
he
hardly
knew
it
for
itself
“he
would
have
shot
me
once,”
he
murmured
“yes
there’s
the
very
musket
that
he
pointed
at
me;—that
one
with
the
studded
stock
let
me
touch
it—lift
it
strange
that
i
who
have
handled
so
many
deadly
lances

that

should
shake

now

must
see
aye
aye
and
powder
in
the
pan;—that’s
not
good
best
spill
it?—wait
i’ll
cure
myself
of
this
i’ll
hold
the
musket
boldly
while
i
think.—i
come
to
report
a
fair
wind
to
him

how
fair
fair
for
death
and
doom,—_that’s_
fair
for

fair
for

accursed

very
one
_this_
one—i
hold
it
here

dashed
his

quadrant

in
these

perilous
seas
gropes
he
not
his
way
by
mere
dead
reckoning
of
the
error-abounding
log
and
in
this
very
typhoon
did
he
not
swear
that
he
would
have
no
lightning-rods
but
shall
this
crazed
old
man
be
tamely
suffered
to
drag
a
whole
ship’s
company
down
to
doom
with
him?—yes
it
would
make
him
the
wilful
murderer
of
thirty
men
and
more
if
this
ship
come
to
any
deadly
harm
and
come
to
deadly
harm

chained
down

slowly
stealthily
and

looking
he
placed

against

door
“on

“stern

clutch

heart
at

such
were
the
sounds
that
now
came
hurtling
from
out
the
old
man’s
tormented
sleep
as
if
starbuck’s
voice
had
caused
the
long
dumb
dream
to
speak
the
yet
levelled
musket
shook
like
a
drunkard’s
arm
against
the
panel
starbuck
seemed
wrestling
with
an
angel
but
turning
from
the
door
he
placed
the
death-tube
in
its
rack
and
left
the
place
“he’s

the
needle
next
morning
the
not-yet-subsided
sea
rolled
in
long
slow
billows
of
mighty
bulk
and
striving
in
the
pequod’s
gurgling
track
pushed
her
on
like
giants’
palms
outspread
the
strong
unstaggering
breeze
abounded
so
that
sky
and
air
seemed
vast
outbellying
sails
the
whole
world
boomed
before
the
wind
muffled
in
the
full
morning
light
the
invisible
sun
was
only
known
by
the
spread
intensity
of
his
place
where
his
bayonet
rays
moved
on
in
stacks
emblazonings
as
of
crowned
babylonian
kings
and
queens
reigned
over
everything
the
sea
was
as
a
crucible
of
molten
gold
that
bubblingly
leaps
with
light
and
heat
long
maintaining
an
enchanted
silence
ahab
stood
apart
and
every
time
the
tetering
ship
loweringly
pitched
down
her
bowsprit
he
turned
to
eye
the
bright
sun’s
rays
produced
ahead
and
when
she
profoundly
settled
by
the
stern
he
turned
behind
and
saw
the
sun’s
rearward
place
and
how
the
same
yellow
rays
were
blending
with
his
undeviating
wake
“ha
ha
my
ship
thou
mightest
well
be
taken
now
for
the
sea-chariot
of
the
sun
ho
ho
all
ye
nations
before
my
prow
i
bring
the
sun
to
ye
yoke
on
the
further
billows
hallo
a
tandem
i
drive
the
sea!”
but
suddenly
reined
back
by
some
counter
thought
he
hurried
towards
the
helm
huskily
demanding
how
the
ship
was
heading
“east-sou-east
sir,”
said
the
frightened
steersman
“thou
liest!”
smiting
him
with
his
clenched
fist
“heading
east
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
and
the
sun
astern?”
upon
this
every
soul
was
confounded
for
the
phenomenon
just
then
observed
by
ahab
had
unaccountably
escaped
every
one
else
but
its
very
blinding
palpableness
must
have
been
the
cause
thrusting
his
head
half
way
into
the
binnacle
ahab
caught
one
glimpse
of
the
compasses
his
uplifted
arm
slowly
fell
for
a
moment
he
almost
seemed
to
stagger
standing
behind
him
starbuck
looked
and
lo
the
two
compasses
pointed
east
and
the
pequod
was
as
infallibly
going
west
but
ere
the
first
wild
alarm
could
get
out
abroad
among
the
crew
the
old
man
with
a
rigid
laugh
exclaimed
“i
have
it
it
has
happened
before
mr
starbuck
last
night’s
thunder
turned
our
compasses—that’s
all
thou
hast
before
now
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
take
it.”
“aye
but
never
before
has
it
happened
to
me
sir,”
said
the
pale
mate
gloomily
here
it
must
needs
be
said
that
accidents
like
this
have
in
more
than
one
case
occurred
to
ships
in
violent
storms
the
magnetic
energy
as
developed
in
the
mariner’s
needle
is
as
all
know
essentially
one
with
the
electricity
beheld
in
heaven
hence
it
is
not
to
be
much
marvelled
at
that
such
things
should
be
instances
where
the
lightning
has
actually
struck
the
vessel
so
as
to
smite
down
some
of
the
spars
and
rigging
the
effect
upon
the
needle
has
at
times
been
still
more
fatal
all
its
loadstone
virtue
being
annihilated
so
that
the
before
magnetic
steel
was
of
no
more
use
than
an
old
wife’s
knitting
needle
but
in
either
case
the
needle
never
again
of
itself
recovers
the
original
virtue
thus
marred
or
lost
and
if
the
binnacle
compasses
be
affected
the
same
fate
reaches
all
the
others
that
may
be
in
the
ship
even
were
the
lowermost
one
inserted
into
the
kelson
deliberately
standing
before
the
binnacle
and
eyeing
the
transpointed
compasses
the
old
man
with
the
sharp
of
his
extended
hand
now
took
the
precise
bearing
of
the
sun
and
satisfied
that
the
needles
were
exactly
inverted
shouted
out
his
orders
for
the
ship’s
course
to
be
changed
accordingly
the
yards
were
hard
up
and
once
more
the
pequod
thrust
her
undaunted
bows
into
the
opposing
wind
for
the
supposed
fair
one
had
only
been
juggling
her
meanwhile
whatever
were
his
own
secret
thoughts
starbuck
said
nothing
but
quietly
he
issued
all
requisite
orders
while
stubb
and
flask—who
in
some
small
degree
seemed
then
to
be
sharing
his
feelings—likewise
unmurmuringly
acquiesced
as
for
the
men
though
some
of
them
lowly
rumbled
their
fear
of
ahab
was
greater
than
their
fear
of
fate
but
as
ever
before
the
pagan
harpooneers
remained
almost
wholly
unimpressed
or
if
impressed
it
was
only
with
a
certain
magnetism
shot
into
their
congenial
hearts
from
inflexible
ahab’s
for
a
space
the
old
man
walked
the
deck
in
rolling
reveries
but
chancing
to
slip
with
his
ivory
heel
he
saw
the
crushed
copper
sight-tubes
of
the
quadrant
he
had
the
day
before
dashed
to
the
deck
“thou
poor
proud
heaven-gazer
and
sun’s
pilot
yesterday
i
wrecked
thee
and
to-day
the
compasses
would
fain
have
wrecked
me
so
so
but
ahab
is
lord
over
the
level
loadstone
yet
mr
starbuck—a
lance
without
a
pole
a
top-maul
and
the
smallest
of
the
sail-maker’s
needles
quick!”
accessory
perhaps
to
the
impulse
dictating
the
thing
he
was
now
about
to
do
were
certain
prudential
motives
whose
object
might
have
been
to
revive
the
spirits
of
his
crew
by
a
stroke
of
his
subtile
skill
in
a
matter
so
wondrous
as
that
of
the
inverted
compasses
besides
the
old
man
well
knew
that
to
steer
by
transpointed
needles
though
clumsily
practicable
was
not
a
thing
to
be
passed
over
by
superstitious
sailors
without
some
shudderings
and
evil
portents
“men,”
said
he
steadily
turning
upon
the
crew
as
the
mate
handed
him
the
things
he
had
demanded
“my
men
the
thunder
turned
old
ahab’s
needles
but
out
of
this
bit
of
steel
ahab
can
make
one
of
his
own
that
will
point
as
true
as
any.”
abashed
glances
of
servile
wonder
were
exchanged
by
the
sailors
as
this
was
said
and
with
fascinated
eyes
they
awaited
whatever
magic
might
follow
but
starbuck
looked
away
with
a
blow
from
the
top-maul
ahab
knocked
off
the
steel
head
of
the
lance
and
then
handing
to
the
mate
the
long
iron
rod
remaining
bade
him
hold
it
upright
without
its
touching
the
deck
then
with
the
maul
after
repeatedly
smiting
the
upper
end
of
this
iron
rod
he
placed
the
blunted
needle
endwise
on
the
top
of
it
and
less
strongly
hammered
that
several
times
the
mate
still
holding
the
rod
as
before
then
going
through
some
small
strange
motions
with
it—whether
indispensable
to
the
magnetizing
of
the
steel
or
merely
intended
to
augment
the
awe
of
the
crew
is
uncertain—he
called
for
linen
thread
and
moving
to
the
binnacle
slipped
out
the
two
reversed
needles
there
and
horizontally
suspended
the
sail-needle
by
its
middle
over
one
of
the
compass-cards
at
first
the
steel
went
round
and
round
quivering
and
vibrating
at
either
end
but
at
last
it
settled
to
its
place
when
ahab
who
had
been
intently
watching
for
this
result
stepped
frankly
back
from
the
binnacle
and
pointing
his
stretched
arm
towards
it
exclaimed,—“look
ye
for
yourselves
if
ahab
be
not
lord
of
the
level
loadstone
the
sun
is
east
and
that
compass
swears
it!”
one
after
another
they
peered
in
for
nothing
but
their
own
eyes
could
persuade
such
ignorance
as
theirs
and
one
after
another
they
slunk
away
in
his
fiery
eyes
of
scorn
and
triumph
you
then
saw
ahab
in
all
his
fatal
pride

while
now
the
fated
pequod
had
been
so
long
afloat
this
voyage
the
log
and

had
but
very
seldom
been
in

owing
to

upon

his
mood
seized
ahab
as
he
happened
to
glance
upon
the
reel
not
many
hours
after
the

and
he
remembered
how
his
quadrant
was
no
more

recalled
his
frantic
oath
about
the

rolled
in

the

and
the

manxman
“take

they
went
towards
the
extreme
stern
on
the
ship’s
lee
side
where
the
deck
with
the
oblique
energy
of
the
wind
was
now
almost
dipping
into
the
creamy
sidelong-rushing
sea
the
manxman
took
the
reel
and
holding
it
high
up
by
the
projecting
handle-ends
of
the
spindle
round
which
the
spool
of
line
revolved
so
stood
with
the
angular
log
hanging
downwards
till
ahab
advanced
to
him
ahab
stood
before
him
and
was
lightly
unwinding
some
thirty
or
forty
turns
to
form
a
preliminary
hand-coil
to
toss
overboard
when
the
old
manxman
who
was
intently
eyeing
both
him
and
the
line
made
bold
to
speak
“sir
i
mistrust
it
this
line
looks
far
gone

heat
and
wet

spoiled
it.”
“’twill
hold
old
gentleman
long
heat
and
wet
have
they
spoiled
thee
thou
seem’st
to
hold
or
truer
perhaps
life
holds
thee
not
thou
it.”
“i
hold
the
spool
sir
but
just
as
my
captain
says
with
these
grey
hairs
of
mine
’tis
not
worth
while
disputing
’specially
with
a
superior
who’ll
ne’er
confess.”
“what’s
that
there
now’s
a
patched
professor
in
queen
nature’s
granite-founded
college
but
methinks
he’s
too
subservient
where
wert
thou
born?”
“in
the
little
rocky
isle
of
man
sir.”
“excellent
thou’st
hit
the
world
by
that.”
“i
know
not
sir
but
i
was

there.”
“in

the
log
was
heaved
the
loose
coils
rapidly
straightened
out
in
a
long
dragging
line
astern
and
then
instantly
the
reel
began
to
whirl
in
turn
jerkingly
raised
and
lowered

the
rolling
billows

of

the

down
in

by

“what’s

intently
gazing
at
ahab’s

and
feeling
it
“ah
now

felt

“there

now,”
muttered
the
old
manxman
“one

daft
with

the
life-buoy
steering
now
south-eastward
by
ahab’s
levelled
steel
and
her
progress
solely
determined
by
ahab’s
level
log
and
line
the
pequod
held
on
her
path
towards
the
equator
making
so
long
a
passage
through
such
unfrequented
waters
descrying
no
ships
and
ere
long
sideways
impelled
by
unvarying
trade
winds
over
waves
monotonously
mild
all
these
seemed
the
strange
calm
things
preluding
some
riotous
and
desperate
scene
at
last
when
the
ship
drew
near
to
the
outskirts
as
it
were
of
the
equatorial
fishing-ground
and
in
the
deep
darkness
that
goes
before
the
dawn
was
sailing
by
a
cluster
of
rocky
islets
the
watch—then
headed
by
flask—was
startled
by
a
cry
so
plaintively
wild
and
unearthly—like
half-articulated
wailings
of
the
ghosts
of
all
herod’s
murdered
innocents—that
one
and
all
they
started
from
their
reveries
and
for
the
space
of
some
moments
stood
or
sat
or
leaned
all
transfixedly
listening
like
the
carved
roman
slave
while
that
wild
cry
remained
within
hearing
the
christian
or
civilized
part
of
the
crew
said
it
was
mermaids
and
shuddered
but
the
pagan
harpooneers
remained
unappalled
yet
the
grey
manxman—the
oldest
mariner
of
all—declared
that
the
wild
thrilling
sounds
that
were
heard
were
the
voices
of
newly
drowned
men
in
the
sea
below
in
his
hammock
ahab
did
not
hear
of
this
till
grey
dawn
when
he
came
to
the
deck
it
was
then
recounted
to
him
by
flask
not
unaccompanied
with
hinted
dark
meanings
he
hollowly
laughed
and
thus
explained
the
wonder
those
rocky
islands
the
ship
had
passed
were
the
resort
of
great
numbers
of
seals
and
some
young
seals
that
had
lost
their
dams
or
some
dams
that
had
lost
their
cubs
must
have
risen
nigh
the
ship
and
kept
company
with
her
crying
and
sobbing
with
their
human
sort
of
wail
but
this
only
the
more
affected
some
of
them
because
most
mariners
cherish
a
very
superstitious
feeling
about
seals
arising
not
only
from
their
peculiar
tones
when
in
distress
but
also
from
the
human
look
of
their
round
heads
and
semi-intelligent
faces
seen
peeringly
uprising
from
the
water
alongside
in
the
sea
under
certain
circumstances
seals
have
more
than
once
been
mistaken
for
men
but
the
bodings
of
the
crew
were
destined
to
receive
a
most
plausible
confirmation
in
the
fate
of
one
of
their
number
that
morning
at
sun-rise
this
man
went
from
his
hammock
to
his
mast-head
at
the
fore
and
whether
it
was
that
he
was
not
yet
half
waked
from
his
sleep
for
sailors
sometimes
go
aloft
in
a
transition
state
whether
it
was
thus
with
the
man
there
is
now
no
telling
but
be
that
as
it
may
he
had
not
been
long
at
his
perch
when
a
cry
was
heard—a
cry
and
a
rushing—and
looking
up
they
saw
a
falling
phantom
in
the
air
and
looking
down
a
little
tossed
heap
of
white
bubbles
in
the
blue
of
the
sea
the
life-buoy—a
long
slender
cask—was
dropped
from
the
stern
where
it
always
hung
obedient
to
a
cunning
spring
but
no
hand
rose
to
seize
it
and
the
sun
having
long
beat
upon
this
cask
it
had
shrunken
so
that
it
slowly
filled
and
that
parched
wood
also
filled
at
its
every
pore
and
the
studded
iron-bound
cask
followed
the
sailor
to
the
bottom
as
if
to
yield
him
his
pillow
though
in
sooth
but
a
hard
one
and
thus
the
first
man
of
the
pequod
that
mounted
the
mast
to
look
out
for
the
white
whale
on
the
white
whale’s
own
peculiar
ground
that
man
was
swallowed
up
in
the
deep
but
few
perhaps
thought
of
that
at
the
time
indeed
in
some
sort
they
were
not
grieved
at
this
event
at
least
as
a
portent
for
they
regarded
it
not
as
a
foreshadowing
of
evil
in
the
future
but
as
the
fulfilment
of
an
evil
already
presaged
they
declared
that
now
they
knew
the
reason
of
those
wild
shrieks
they
had
heard
the
night
before
but
again
the
old
manxman
said
nay
the
lost
life-buoy
was
now
to
be
replaced
starbuck
was
directed
to
see
to
it
but
as
no
cask
of
sufficient
lightness
could
be
found
and
as
in
the
feverish
eagerness
of
what
seemed
the
approaching
crisis
of
the
voyage
all
hands
were
impatient
of
any
toil
but
what
was
directly
connected
with
its
final
end
whatever
that
might
prove
to
be
therefore
they
were
going
to
leave
the
ship’s
stern
unprovided
with
a
buoy
when
by
certain
strange
signs
and
inuendoes
queequeg
hinted
a
hint
concerning
his
coffin
“a
life-buoy
of
a
coffin!”
cried
starbuck
starting
“rather
queer
that
i
should
say,”
said
stubb
“it
will
make
a
good
enough
one,”
said
flask
“the
carpenter
here
can
arrange
it
easily.”
“bring
it
up
there’s
nothing
else
for
it,”
said
starbuck
after
a
melancholy
pause
“rig
it
carpenter
do
not
look
at
me
so—the
coffin
i
mean
dost
thou
hear
me
rig
it.”
“and
shall
i
nail
down
the
lid
sir?”
moving
his
hand
as
with
a
hammer
“aye.”
“and
shall
i
caulk
the
seams
sir?”
moving
his
hand
as
with
a
caulking-iron
“aye.”
“and
shall
i
then
pay
over
the
same
with
pitch
sir?”
moving
his
hand
as
with
a
pitch-pot
“away
what
possesses
thee
to
this
make
a
life-buoy
of
the
coffin
and
no
more.—mr
stubb
mr
flask
come
forward
with
me.”
“he
goes
off
in
a
huff
the
whole
he
can
endure
at
the
parts
he
baulks
now
i
don’t
like
this
i
make
a
leg
for
captain
ahab
and
he
wears
it
like
a
gentleman
but
i
make
a
bandbox
for
queequeg
and
he
won’t
put
his
head
into
it
are
all
my
pains
to
go
for
nothing
with
that
coffin
and
now
i’m
ordered
to
make
a
life-buoy
of
it
it’s
like
turning
an
old
coat
going
to
bring
the
flesh
on
the
other
side
now
i
don’t
like
this
cobbling
sort
of
business—i
don’t
like
it
at
all
it’s
undignified
it’s
not
my
place
let
tinkers’
brats
do
tinkerings
we
are
their
betters
i
like
to
take
in
hand
none
but
clean
virgin
fair-and-square
mathematical
jobs
something
that
regularly
begins
at
the
beginning
and
is
at
the
middle
when
midway
and
comes
to
an
end
at
the
conclusion
not
a
cobbler’s
job
that’s
at
an
end
in
the
middle
and
at
the
beginning
at
the
end
it’s
the
old
woman’s
tricks
to
be
giving
cobbling
jobs
lord
what
an
affection
all
old
women
have
for
tinkers
i
know
an
old
woman
of
sixty-five
who
ran
away
with
a
bald-headed
young
tinker
once
and
that’s
the
reason
i
never
would
work
for
lonely
widow
old
women
ashore
when
i
kept
my
job-shop
in
the
vineyard
they
might
have
taken
it
into
their
lonely
old
heads
to
run
off
with
me
but
heigh-ho
there
are
no
caps
at
sea
but
snow-caps
let
me
see
nail
down
the
lid
caulk
the
seams
pay
over
the
same
with
pitch
batten
them
down
tight
and
hang
it
with
the
snap-spring
over
the
ship’s
stern
were
ever
such
things
done
before
with
a
coffin
some
superstitious
old
carpenters
now
would
be
tied
up
in
the
rigging
ere
they
would
do
the
job
but
i’m
made
of
knotty
aroostook
hemlock
i
don’t
budge
cruppered
with
a
coffin
sailing
about
with
a
grave-yard
tray
but
never
mind
we
workers
in
woods
make
bridal-bedsteads
and
card-tables
as
well
as
coffins
and
hearses
we
work
by
the
month
or
by
the
job
or
by
the
profit
not
for
us
to
ask
the
why
and
wherefore
of
our
work
unless
it
be
too
confounded
cobbling
and
then
we
stash
it
if
we
can
hem
i’ll
do
the
job
now
tenderly
i’ll
have
me—let’s
see—how
many
in
the
ship’s
company
all
told
but
i’ve
forgotten
any
way
i’ll
have
me
thirty
separate
turk’s-headed
life-lines
each
three
feet
long
hanging
all
round
to
the
coffin
then
if
the

go
down
there’ll
be
thirty

i
patched
up
this
thing
here
as
a

they’ve
set
me
now
to

the
pequod
meets
the
rachel
next
day
a
large
ship
the
rachel
was
descried
bearing
directly
down
upon
the
pequod
all
her
spars
thickly
clustering
with
men
at
the
time
the
pequod
was
making
good
speed
through
the
water
but
as
the
broad-winged
windward
stranger
shot
nigh
to
her
the
boastful
sails
all
fell
together
as
blank
bladders
that
are
burst
and
all
life
fled
from
the
smitten
hull
“bad
news
she
brings
bad
news,”
muttered
the
old
manxman
but
ere
her
commander
who
with
trumpet
to
mouth
stood
up
in
his
boat
ere
he
could
hopefully
hail
ahab’s
voice
was
heard
“hast
seen
the
white
whale?”
“aye
yesterday
have
ye
seen
a
whale-boat
adrift?”
throttling
his
joy
ahab
negatively
answered
this
unexpected
question
and
would
then
have
fain
boarded
the
stranger
when
the
stranger
captain
himself
having
stopped
his
vessel’s
way
was
seen
descending
her
side
a
few
keen
pulls
and
his
boat-hook
soon
clinched
the
pequod’s
main-chains
and
he
sprang
to
the
deck
immediately
he
was
recognised
by
ahab
for
a
nantucketer
he
knew
but
no
formal
salutation
was
exchanged
“where
was
he?—not
killed!—not
killed!”
cried
ahab
closely
advancing
“how
was
it?”
it
seemed
that
somewhat
late
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
previous
while
three
of
the
stranger’s
boats
were
engaged
with
a
shoal
of
whales
which
had
led
them
some
four
or
five
miles
from
the
ship
and
while
they
were
yet
in
swift
chase
to
windward
the
white
hump
and
head
of
moby
dick
had
suddenly
loomed
up
out
of
the
water
not
very
far
to
leeward
whereupon
the
fourth
rigged
boat—a
reserved
one—had
been
instantly
lowered
in
chase
after
a
keen
sail
before
the
wind
this
fourth
boat—the
swiftest
keeled
of
all—seemed
to
have
succeeded
in
fastening—at
least
as
well
as
the
man
at
the
mast-head
could
tell
anything
about
it
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
diminished
dotted
boat
and
then
a
swift
gleam
of
bubbling
white
water
and
after
that
nothing
more
whence
it
was
concluded
that
the
stricken
whale
must
have
indefinitely
run
away
with
his
pursuers
as
often
happens
there
was
some
apprehension
but
no
positive
alarm
as
yet
the
recall
signals
were
placed
in
the
rigging
darkness
came
on
and
forced
to
pick
up
her
three
far
to
windward
boats—ere
going
in
quest
of
the
fourth
one
in
the
precisely
opposite
direction—the
ship
had
not
only
been
necessitated
to
leave
that
boat
to
its
fate
till
near
midnight
but
for
the
time
to
increase
her
distance
from
it
but
the
rest
of
her
crew
being
at
last
safe
aboard
she
crowded
all
sail—stunsail
on
stunsail—after
the
missing
boat
kindling
a
fire
in
her
try-pots
for
a
beacon
and
every
other
man
aloft
on
the
look-out
but
though
when
she
had
thus
sailed
a
sufficient
distance
to
gain
the
presumed
place
of
the
absent
ones
when
last
seen
though
she
then
paused
to
lower
her
spare
boats
to
pull
all
around
her
and
not
finding
anything
had
again
dashed
on
again
paused
and
lowered
her
boats
and
though
she
had
thus
continued
doing
till
daylight
yet
not
the
least
glimpse
of
the
missing
keel
had
been
seen
the
story
told
the
stranger
captain
immediately
went
on
to
reveal
his
object
in
boarding
the
pequod
he
desired
that
ship
to
unite
with
his
own
in
the
search
by
sailing
over
the
sea
some
four
or
five
miles
apart
on
parallel
lines
and
so
sweeping
a
double
horizon
as
it
were
“i
will
wager
something
now,”
whispered
stubb
to
flask
“that
some
one
in
that
missing
boat
wore
off
that
captain’s
best
coat
mayhap
his
watch—he’s
so
cursed
anxious
to
get
it
back
who
ever
heard
of
two
pious
whale-ships
cruising
after
one
missing
whale-boat
in
the
height
of
the
whaling
season
see
flask
only
see
how
pale
he
looks—pale
in
the
very
buttons
of
his
eyes—look—it
wasn’t
the
coat—it
must
have
been
the—”
“my
boy
my
own
boy
is
among
them
for
god’s
sake—i
beg
i
conjure”—here
exclaimed
the
stranger
captain
to
ahab
who
thus
far
had
but
icily
received
his
petition
“for
eight-and-forty
hours
let
me
charter
your
ship—i
will
gladly
pay
for
it
and
roundly
pay
for
it—if
there
be
no
other
way—for
eight-and-forty
hours
only—only
that—you
must
oh
you
must
and
you
_shall_
do
this
thing.”
“his
son!”
cried
stubb
“oh
it’s
his
son
he’s
lost
i
take
back
the
coat
and
watch—what
says
ahab
we
must
save
that
boy.”
“he’s
drowned
with
the
rest
on
’em
last
night,”
said
the
old
manx
sailor
standing
behind
them
“i
heard
all
of
ye
heard
their
spirits.”
now
as
it
shortly
turned
out
what
made
this
incident
of
the
rachel’s
the
more
melancholy
was
the
circumstance
that
not
only
was
one
of
the
captain’s
sons
among
the
number
of
the
missing
boat’s
crew
but
among
the
number
of
the
other
boat’s
crews
at
the
same
time
but
on
the
other
hand
separated
from
the
ship
during
the
dark
vicissitudes
of
the
chase
there
had
been
still
another
son
as
that
for
a
time
the
wretched
father
was
plunged
to
the
bottom
of
the
cruellest
perplexity
which
was
only
solved
for
him
by
his
chief
mate’s
instinctively
adopting
the
ordinary
procedure
of
a
whale-ship
in
such
emergencies
that
is
when
placed
between
jeopardized
but
divided
boats
always
to
pick
up
the
majority
first
but
the
captain
for
some
unknown
constitutional
reason
had
refrained
from
mentioning
all
this
and
not
till
forced
to
it
by
ahab’s
iciness
did
he
allude
to
his
one
yet
missing
boy
a
little
lad
but
twelve
years
old
whose
father
with
the
earnest
but
unmisgiving
hardihood
of
a
nantucketer’s
paternal
love
had
thus
early
sought
to
initiate
him
in
the
perils
and
wonders
of
a
vocation
almost
immemorially
the
destiny
of
all
his
race
nor
does
it
unfrequently
occur
that
nantucket
captains
will
send
a
son
of
such
tender
age
away
from
them
for
a
protracted
three
or
four
years’
voyage
in
some
other
ship
than
their
own
so
that
their
first
knowledge
of
a
whaleman’s
career
shall
be
unenervated
by
any
chance
display
of
a
father’s
natural
but
untimely
partiality
or
undue
apprehensiveness
and
concern
meantime
now
the
stranger
was
still
beseeching
his
poor
boon
of
ahab
and
ahab
still
stood
like
an
anvil
receiving
every
shock
but
without
the
least
quivering
of
his
own
“i
will
not
go,”
said
the
stranger
“till
you
say
_aye_
to
me
do
to
me
as
you
would
have
me
do
to
you
in
the
like
case
for
_you_
too
have
a
boy
captain
ahab—though
but
a
child
and
nestling
safely
at
home
now—a
child
of
your
old
age
too—yes
yes
you
relent
i
see
it—run
run
men
now
and
stand
by
to
square
in
the
yards.”
“avast,”
cried
ahab—“touch
not
a
rope-yarn”
then
in
a
voice
that
prolongingly
moulded
every
word—“captain
gardiner
i
will
not
do
it
even
now
i
lose
time
good-bye
good-bye
god
bless
ye
man
and
may
i
forgive
myself
but
i
must
go
mr
starbuck
look
at
the
binnacle
watch
and
in
three
minutes
from
this
present
instant
warn
off
all
strangers
then
brace
forward
again
and
let
the
ship
sail
as
before.”
hurriedly
turning
with
averted
face
he
descended
into
his
cabin
leaving
the
strange
captain
transfixed
at
this
unconditional
and
utter
rejection
of
his
so
earnest
suit
but
starting
from
his
enchantment
gardiner
silently
hurried
to
the
side
more
fell
than
stepped
into
his
boat
and
returned
to
his
ship
soon
the
two
ships
diverged
their
wakes
and
long
as
the
strange
vessel
was
in
view
she
was
seen
to
yaw
hither
and
thither
at
every
dark
spot
however
small
on
the
sea
this
way
and
that
her
yards
were
swung
round
starboard
and
larboard
she
continued
to
tack
now
she
beat
against
a
head
sea
and
again
it
pushed
her
before
it
while
all
the
while
her
masts
and
yards
were
thickly
clustered
with
men
as
three
tall
cherry
trees
when
the
boys
are
cherrying
among
the
boughs
but
by
her
still
halting
course
and
winding
woeful
way
you
plainly
saw
that
this
ship
that
so
wept
with
spray
still
remained
without
comfort
she
was
rachel
weeping
for
her
children
because
they
were

the

and
now
that
at
the
proper
time
and
place
after
so
long
and
wide
a
preliminary
cruise
ahab,—all
other
whaling
waters
swept—seemed
to
have
chased
his
foe
into
an
ocean-fold
to
slay
him
the
more
securely
there
now
that
he
found
himself
hard
by
the
very
latitude
and
longitude
where
his
tormenting
wound
had
been
inflicted
now
that
a
vessel
had
been
spoken
which
on
the
very
day
preceding
had
actually
encountered
moby
dick;—and
now
that
all
his
successive
meetings
with
various
ships
contrastingly
concurred
to
show
the
demoniac
indifference
with
which
the
white
whale
tore
his
hunters
whether
sinning
or
sinned
against
now
it
was
that
there
lurked
a
something
in
the
old
man’s
eyes
which
it
was
hardly
sufferable
for
feeble
souls
to
see
as
the
unsetting
polar
star
which
through
the
livelong
arctic
six
months’
night
sustains
its
piercing
steady
central
gaze
so
ahab’s
purpose
now
fixedly
gleamed
down
upon
the
constant
midnight
of
the
gloomy
crew
it
domineered
above
them
so
that
all
their
bodings
doubts
misgivings
fears
were
fain
to
hide
beneath
their
souls
and
not
sprout
forth
a
single
spear
or
leaf
in
this
foreshadowing
interval
too
all
humor
forced
or
natural
vanished
stubb
no
more
strove
to
raise
a
smile
starbuck
no
more
strove
to
check
one
alike
joy
and
sorrow
hope
and
fear
seemed
ground
to
finest
dust
and
powdered
for
the
time
in
the
clamped
mortar
of
ahab’s
iron
soul
like
machines
they
dumbly
moved
about
the
deck
ever
conscious
that
the
old
man’s
despot
eye
was
on
them
but
did
you
deeply
scan
him
in
his
more
secret
confidential
hours
when
he
thought
no
glance
but
one
was
on
him
then
you
would
have
seen
that
even
as
ahab’s
eyes
so
awed
the
crew’s
the
inscrutable
parsee’s
glance
awed
his
or
somehow
at
least
in
some
wild
way
at
times
affected
it
such
an
added
gliding
strangeness
began
to
invest
the
thin
fedallah
now
such
ceaseless
shudderings
shook
him
that
the
men
looked
dubious
at
him
half
uncertain
as
it
seemed
whether
indeed
he
were
a
mortal
substance
or
else
a
tremulous
shadow
cast
upon
the
deck
by
some
unseen
being’s
body
and
that
shadow
was
always
hovering
there
for
not
by
night
even
had
fedallah
ever
certainly
been
known
to
slumber
or
go
below
he
would
stand
still
for
hours
but
never
sat
or
leaned
his
wan
but
wondrous
eyes
did
plainly
say—we
two
watchmen
never
rest
nor
at
any
time
by
night
or
day
could
the
mariners
now
step
upon
the
deck
unless
ahab
was
before
them
either
standing
in
his
pivot-hole
or
exactly
pacing
the
planks
between
two
undeviating
limits,—the
main-mast
and
the
mizen
or
else
they
saw
him
standing
in
the
cabin-scuttle,—his
living
foot
advanced
upon
the
deck
as
if
to
step
his
hat
slouched
heavily
over
his
eyes
so
that
however
motionless
he
stood
however
the
days
and
nights
were
added
on
that
he
had
not
swung
in
his
hammock
yet
hidden
beneath
that
slouching
hat
they
could
never
tell
unerringly
whether
for
all
this
his
eyes
were
really
closed
at
times
or
whether
he
was
still
intently
scanning
them
no
matter
though
he
stood
so
in
the
scuttle
for
a
whole
hour
on
the
stretch
and
the
unheeded
night-damp
gathered
in
beads
of
dew
upon
that
stone-carved
coat
and
hat
the
clothes
that
the
night
had
wet
the
next
day’s
sunshine
dried
upon
him
and
so
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
he
went
no
more
beneath
the
planks
whatever
he
wanted
from
the
cabin
that
thing
he
sent
for
he
ate
in
the
same
open
air
that
is
his
two
only
meals,—breakfast
and
dinner
supper
he
never
touched
nor
reaped
his
beard
which
darkly
grew
all
gnarled
as
unearthed
roots
of
trees
blown
over
which
still
grow
idly
on
at
naked
base
though
perished
in
the
upper
verdure
but
though
his
whole
life
was
now
become
one
watch
on
deck
and
though
the
parsee’s
mystic
watch
was
without
intermission
as
his
own
yet
these
two
never
seemed
to
speak—one
man
to
the
other—unless
at
long
intervals
some
passing
unmomentous
matter
made
it
necessary
though
such
a
potent
spell
seemed
secretly
to
join
the
twain
openly
and
to
the
awe-struck
crew
they
seemed
pole-like
asunder
if
by
day
they
chanced
to
speak
one
word
by
night
dumb
men
were
both
so
far
as
concerned
the
slightest
verbal
interchange
at
times
for
longest
hours
without
a
single
hail
they
stood
far
parted
in
the
starlight
ahab
in
his
scuttle
the
parsee
by
the
mainmast
but
still
fixedly
gazing
upon
each
other
as
if
in
the
parsee
ahab
saw
his
forethrown
shadow
in
ahab
the
parsee
his
abandoned
substance
and
yet
somehow
did
ahab—in
his
own
proper
self
as
daily
hourly
and
every
instant
commandingly
revealed
to
his
subordinates,—ahab
seemed
an
independent
lord
the
parsee
but
his
slave
still
again
both
seemed
yoked
together
and
an
unseen
tyrant
driving
them
the
lean
shade
siding
the
solid
rib
for
be
this
parsee
what
he
may
all
rib
and
keel
was
solid
ahab
at
the
first
faintest
glimmering
of
the
dawn
his
iron
voice
was
heard
from
aft,—“man
the
mast-heads!”—and
all
through
the
day
till
after
sunset
and
after
twilight
the
same
voice
every
hour
at
the
striking
of
the
helmsman’s
bell
was
heard—“what
d’ye
see?—sharp
sharp!”
but
when
three
or
four
days
had
slided
by
after
meeting
the
children-seeking
rachel
and
no
spout
had
yet
been
seen
the
monomaniac
old
man
seemed
distrustful
of
his
crew’s
fidelity
at
least
of
nearly
all
except
the
pagan
harpooneers
he
seemed
to
doubt
even
whether
stubb
and
flask
might
not
willingly
overlook
the
sight
he
sought
but
if
these
suspicions
were
really
his
he
sagaciously
refrained
from
verbally
expressing
them
however
his
actions
might
seem
to
hint
them
“i
will
have
the
first
sight
of
the
whale
myself,”—he
said
“aye
ahab
must
have
the
doubloon!”
and
with
his
own
hands
he
rigged
a
nest
of
basketed
bowlines
and
sending
a
hand
aloft
with
a
single
sheaved
block
to
secure
to
the
main-mast
head
he
received
the
two
ends
of
the
downward-reeved
rope
and
attaching
one
to
his
basket
prepared
a
pin
for
the
other
end
in
order
to
fasten
it
at
the
rail
this
done
with
that
end
yet
in
his
hand
and
standing
beside
the
pin
he
looked
round
upon
his
crew
sweeping
from
one
to
the
other
pausing
his
glance
long
upon
daggoo
queequeg
tashtego
but
shunning
fedallah
and
then
settling
his
firm
relying
eye
upon
the
chief
mate
said,—“take
the
rope
sir—i
give
it
into
thy
hands
starbuck.”
then
arranging
his
person
in
the
basket
he
gave
the
word
for
them
to
hoist
him
to
his
perch
starbuck
being
the
one
who
secured
the
rope
at
last
and
afterwards
stood
near
it
and
thus
with
one
hand
clinging
round
the
royal
mast
ahab
gazed
abroad
upon
the
sea
for
miles
and
miles,—ahead
astern
this
side
and
that,—within
the
wide
expanded
circle
commanded
at
so
great
a
height
when
in
working
with
his
hands
at
some
lofty
almost
isolated
place
in
the
rigging
which
chances
to
afford
no
foothold
the
sailor
at
sea
is
hoisted
up
to
that
spot
and
sustained
there
by
the
rope
under
these
circumstances
its
fastened
end
on
deck
is
always
given
in
strict
charge
to
some
one
man
who
has
the
special
watch
of
it
because
in
such
a
wilderness
of
running
rigging
whose
various
different
relations
aloft
cannot
always
be
infallibly
discerned
by
what
is
seen
of
them
at
the
deck
and
when
the
deck-ends
of
these
ropes
are
being
every
few
minutes
cast
down
from
the
fastenings
it
would
be
but
a
natural
fatality
if
unprovided
with
a
constant
watchman
the
hoisted
sailor
should
by
some
carelessness
of
the
crew
be
cast
adrift
and
fall
all
swooping
to
the
sea
so
ahab’s
proceedings
in
this
matter
were
not
unusual
the
only
strange
thing
about
them
seemed
to
be
that
starbuck
almost
the
one
only
man
who
had
ever
ventured
to
oppose
him
with
anything
in
the
slightest
degree
approaching
to
decision—one
of
those
too
whose
faithfulness
on
the
look-out
he
had
seemed
to
doubt
somewhat;—it
was
strange
that
this
was
the
very
man
he
should
select
for
his
watchman
freely
giving
his
whole
life
into
such
an
otherwise
distrusted
person’s
hands
now
the
first
time
ahab
was
perched
aloft
ere
he
had
been
there
ten
minutes
one
of
those
red-billed
savage
sea-hawks
which
so
often
fly
incommodiously
close
round
the
manned
mast-heads
of
whalemen
in
these
latitudes
one
of
these
birds
came
wheeling
and
screaming
round
his
head
in
a
maze
of
untrackably
swift
circlings
then
it
darted
a
thousand
feet
straight
up
into
the
air
then
spiralized
downwards
and
went
eddying
again
round
his
head
but
with
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
dim
and
distant
horizon
ahab
seemed
not
to
mark
this
wild
bird
nor
indeed
would
any
one
else
have
marked
it
much
it
being
no
uncommon
circumstance
only
now
almost
the
least
heedful
eye
seemed
to
see
some
sort
of
cunning
meaning
in
almost
every
sight
“your
hat
your
hat
sir!”
suddenly
cried
the
sicilian
seaman
who
being
posted
at
the
mizen-mast-head
stood
directly
behind
ahab
though
somewhat
lower
than
his
level
and
with
a
deep
gulf
of
air
dividing
them
but
already
the
sable
wing
was
before
the
old
man’s
eyes
the
long
hooked
bill
at
his
head
with
a
scream
the
black
hawk
darted
away
with
his
prize
an
eagle
flew
thrice
round
tarquin’s
head
removing
his
cap
to
replace
it
and
thereupon
tanaquil
his
wife
declared
that
tarquin
would
be
king
of
rome
but
only
by
the
replacing
of
the
cap
was
that
omen
accounted
good
ahab’s
hat
was
never
restored
the
wild
hawk
flew
on
and
on
with
it
far
in
advance
of
the
prow
and
at
last
disappeared
while
from
the
point
of
that
disappearance
a
minute
black
spot
was
dimly
discerned
falling
from
that
vast
height
into
the
sea

the
intense
pequod
sailed
on
the
rolling
waves
and
days
went
by
the
life-buoy-coffin
still
lightly
swung
and
another
ship
most
miserably
misnamed
the
delight
was
descried
as
she
drew
nigh
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
broad
beams
called
shears
which
in
some
whaling-ships
cross
the
quarter-deck
at
the
height
of
eight
or
nine
feet
serving
to
carry
the
spare
unrigged
or
disabled
boats
upon
the
stranger’s
shears
were
beheld
the
shattered
white
ribs
and
some
few
splintered
planks
of
what
had
once
been
a
whale-boat
but
you
now
saw
through
this
wreck
as
plainly
as
you
see
through
the
peeled
half-unhinged
and
bleaching
skeleton
of
a
horse
“hast
seen
the
white
whale?”
“look!”
replied
the
hollow-cheeked
captain
from
his
taffrail
and
with
his
trumpet
he
pointed
to
the
wreck
“hast
killed
him?”
“the
harpoon
is
not
yet
forged
that
ever
will
do
that,”
answered
the
other
sadly
glancing
upon
a
rounded
hammock
on
the
deck
whose
gathered
sides
some
noiseless
sailors
were
busy
in
sewing
together
“not
forged!”
and
snatching
perth’s
levelled
iron
from
the
crotch
ahab
held
it
out
exclaiming—“look
ye
nantucketer
here
in
this
hand
i
hold
his
death
tempered
in
blood
and
tempered
by
lightning
are
these
barbs
and
i
swear
to
temper
them
triply
in
that
hot
place
behind
the
fin
where
the
white
whale
most
feels
his
accursed
life!”
“then
god
keep
thee
old
man—see’st
thou
that”—pointing
to
the
hammock—“i
bury
but
one
of
five
stout
men
who
were
alive
only
yesterday
but
were
dead
ere
night
only
_that_
one
i
bury
the
rest
were
buried
before
they
died
you
sail
upon
their
tomb.”
then
turning
to
his
crew—“are
ye
ready
there
place
the
plank
then
on
the
rail
and
lift
the
body
so
then—oh
god”—advancing
towards
the
hammock
with
uplifted
hands—“may
the
resurrection
and
the
life——”
“brace
forward
up
helm!”
cried
ahab
like
lightning
to
his
men
but
the
suddenly
started
pequod
was
not
quick
enough
to
escape
the
sound
of
the
splash
that
the
corpse
soon
made
as
it
struck
the
sea
not
so
quick
indeed
but
that
some
of
the
flying
bubbles
might
have
sprinkled
her
hull
with
their
ghostly
baptism
as
ahab
now
glided
from
the
dejected
delight
the
strange
life-buoy
hanging
at
the
pequod’s
stern
came
into
conspicuous
relief
“ha
yonder
look
yonder
men!”
cried
a
foreboding
voice
in
her
wake
“in
vain
oh
ye
strangers
ye
fly
our
sad
burial
ye
but
turn
us
your
taffrail
to
show
us
your
coffin!”

the
symphony
it
was
a
clear
steel-blue
day
the
firmaments
of
air
and
sea
were
hardly
separable
in
that
all-pervading
azure
only
the
pensive
air
was
transparently
pure
and
soft
with
a
woman’s
look
and
the
robust
and
man-like
sea
heaved
with
long
strong
lingering
swells
as
samson’s
chest
in
his
sleep
hither
and
thither
on
high
glided
the
snow-white
wings
of
small
unspeckled
birds
these
were
the
gentle
thoughts
of
the
feminine
air
but
to
and
fro
in
the
deeps
far
down
in
the
bottomless
blue
rushed
mighty
leviathans
sword-fish
and
sharks
and
these
were
the
strong
troubled
murderous
thinkings
of
the
masculine
sea
but
though
thus
contrasting
within
the
contrast
was
only
in
shades
and
shadows
without
those
two
seemed
one
it
was
only
the
sex
as
it
were
that
distinguished
them
aloft
like
a
royal
czar
and
king
the
sun
seemed
giving
this
gentle
air
to
this
bold
and
rolling
sea
even
as
bride
to
groom
and
at
the
girdling
line
of
the
horizon
a
soft
and
tremulous
motion—most
seen
here
at
the
equator—denoted
the
fond
throbbing
trust
the
loving
alarms
with
which
the
poor
bride
gave
her
bosom
away
tied
up
and
twisted
gnarled
and
knotted
with
wrinkles
haggardly
firm
and
unyielding
his
eyes
glowing
like
coals
that
still
glow
in
the
ashes
of
ruin
untottering
ahab
stood
forth
in
the
clearness
of
the
morn
lifting
his
splintered
helmet
of
a
brow
to
the
fair
girl’s
forehead
of
heaven
oh
immortal
infancy
and
innocency
of
the
azure
invisible
winged
creatures
that
frolic
all
round
us
sweet
childhood
of
air
and
sky
how
oblivious
were
ye
of
old
ahab’s
close-coiled
woe
but
so
have
i
seen
little
miriam
and
martha
laughing-eyed
elves
heedlessly
gambol
around
their
old
sire
sporting
with
the
circle
of
singed
locks
which
grew
on
the
marge
of
that
burnt-out
crater
of
his
brain
slowly
crossing
the
deck
from
the
scuttle
ahab
leaned
over
the
side
and
watched
how
his
shadow
in
the
water
sank
and
sank
to
his
gaze
the
more
and
the
more
that
he
strove
to
pierce
the
profundity
but
the
lovely
aromas
in
that
enchanted
air
did
at
last
seem
to
dispel
for
a
moment
the
cankerous
thing
in
his
soul
that
glad
happy
air
that
winsome
sky
did
at
last
stroke
and
caress
him
the
step-mother
world
so
long
cruel—forbidding—now
threw
affectionate
arms
round
his
stubborn
neck
and
did
seem
to
joyously
sob
over
him
as
if
over
one
that
however
wilful
and
erring
she
could
yet
find
it
in
her
heart
to
save
and
to
bless
from
beneath
his
slouched
hat
ahab
dropped
a
tear
into
the
sea
nor
did
all
the
pacific
contain
such
wealth
as
that
one
wee
drop
starbuck
saw
the
old
man
saw
him
how
he
heavily
leaned
over
the
side
and
he
seemed
to
hear
in
his
own
true
heart
the
measureless
sobbing
that
stole
out
of
the
centre
of
the
serenity
around
careful
not
to
touch
him
or
be
noticed
by
him
he
yet
drew
near
to
him
and
stood
there
ahab
turned
“starbuck!”
“sir.”
“oh
starbuck

half-suspected

keenly
known

before—and
how
for
forty
years
i
have
fed
upon
dry
salted
fare—fit
emblem
of
the
dry
nourishment
of
my
soil!—when
the

has
had
fresh

to

broken

fresh
bread
to
my
mouldy

that
night
in
the
mid-watch
when
the
old
man—as
his
wont
at
intervals—stepped
forth
from
the
scuttle
in
which
he
leaned
and
went
to
his
pivot-hole
he
suddenly
thrust
out
his
face
fiercely
snuffing
up
the
sea
air
as
a
sagacious
ship’s
dog
will
in
drawing
nigh
to

barbarous
isle
he
declared
that

must
be
near
soon

peculiar
odor
sometimes
to
a
great
distance
given
forth
by
the
living
sperm
whale
was
palpable
to
all
the
watch

was
any
mariner
surprised
when
after
inspecting
the
compass
and
then
the
dog-vane
and
then
ascertaining
the
precise
bearing
of
the
odor
as
nearly
as
possible
ahab
rapidly
ordered
the
ship’s
course
to
be
slightly
altered
and
the
sail
to
be
shortened
the
acute
policy
dictating
these
movements
was
sufficiently
vindicated
at
daybreak
by
the
sight
of
a
long
sleek
on
the
sea
directly
and
lengthwise
ahead
smooth
as
oil
and
resembling
in
the
pleated
watery
wrinkles
bordering
it
the
polished
metallic-like
marks
of
some
swift
tide-rip
at
the
mouth
of

with
their

in

“what

cried
ahab
flattening
his

to
the

the

down
in

cast
loose
the
life-line
reserved
for
swaying
him
to
the
main
royal-mast
head
and
in
a
few
moments
they
were
hoisting
him
thither
when
while
but
two
thirds
of
the
way
aloft
and
while
peering
ahead
through
the
horizontal
vacancy
between
the
main-top-sail
and
top-gallant-sail
he
raised
a
gull-like
cry
in
the
air
“there
she
blows!—there
she
blows
a
hump
like
a
snow-hill
it
is
moby
dick!”
fired
by
the
cry
which
seemed
simultaneously
taken
up
by
the
three
look-outs
the
men
on
deck
rushed
to
the
rigging
to
behold
the
famous
whale
they
had
so
long
been
pursuing
ahab
had
now
gained
his
final
perch
some
feet
above
the
other
look-outs
tashtego
standing
just
beneath
him
on
the
cap
of
the
top-gallant-mast
so
that
the
indian’s
head
was
almost
on
a
level
with
ahab’s
heel
from
this
height
the
whale
was
now
seen
some
mile
or
so
ahead
at
every
roll
of
the
sea
revealing
his
high
sparkling
hump
and
regularly
jetting
his
silent
spout
into
the
air
to
the
credulous
mariners
it
seemed
the
same
silent
spout
they
had
so
long
ago
beheld
in
the
moonlit
atlantic
and
indian
oceans
“and
did
none
of
ye
see
it
before?”
cried
ahab
hailing
the
perched
men
all
around
him
“i
saw
him
almost
that
same
instant
sir
that
captain
ahab
did
and
i
cried
out,”
said
tashtego
“not
the
same
instant
not
the
same—no
the
doubloon
is
mine
fate
reserved
the
doubloon
for
me
_i_
only
none
of
ye
could
have
raised
the
white
whale
first
there
she
blows!—there
she
blows!—there
she
blows
there
again!—there
again!”
he
cried
in
long-drawn
lingering
methodic
tones
attuned
to
the
gradual
prolongings
of
the
whale’s
visible
jets
“he’s
going
to
sound
in
stunsails
down
top-gallant-sails

by

boats
mr
starbuck
remember

and
he
slid
through
the
air
to
the
deck
“he
is
heading
straight
to
leeward
sir,”
cried
stubb
“right
away
from
us
cannot
have
seen
the
ship

“be
dumb
man
stand
by
the
braces
hard
down
the

up
shiver

her!—so
well
that

boats!”
soon
all
the
boats
but
starbuck’s
were
dropped
all
the
boat-sails
set—all
the
paddles
plying
with
rippling
swiftness
shooting
to
leeward
and
ahab
heading
the
onset
a
pale
death-glimmer
lit
up
fedallah’s
sunken
eyes
a
hideous
motion
gnawed
his
mouth
like
noiseless
nautilus
shells
their
light
prows
sped
through
the
sea
but
only
slowly
they
neared
the
foe
as
they
neared
him
the
ocean
grew
still
more
smooth
seemed
drawing
a
carpet
over
its
waves
seemed
a
noon-meadow
so
serenely
it
spread
at
length
the
breathless
hunter
came
so
nigh
his
seemingly
unsuspecting
prey
that
his
entire
dazzling
hump
was
distinctly
visible
sliding
along
the
sea
as
if
an
isolated
thing
and
continually
set
in
a
revolving
ring
of
finest
fleecy
greenish
foam
he
saw
the
vast
involved
wrinkles
of
the
slightly
projecting
head
beyond
before
it
far
out
on
the
soft
turkish-rugged
waters
went
the
glistening
white
shadow
from
his
broad
milky
forehead
a
musical
rippling
playfully
accompanying
the
shade
and
behind
the
blue
waters
interchangeably
flowed
over
into
the
moving
valley
of
his
steady
wake
and
on
either
hand
bright
bubbles
arose
and
danced
by
his
side
but
these
were
broken
again
by
the
light
toes
of
hundreds
of
gay
fowl
softly
feathering
the
sea
alternate
with
their
fitful
flight
and
like
to
some
flag-staff
rising
from
the
painted
hull
of
an
argosy
the
tall
but
shattered
pole
of
a
recent
lance
projected
from
the
white
whale’s
back
and
at
intervals
one
of
the
cloud
of
soft-toed
fowls
hovering
and
to
and
fro
skimming
like
a
canopy
over
the
fish
silently
perched
and
rocked
on
this
pole
the
long
tail
feathers
streaming
like
pennons
a
gentle
joyousness—a
mighty
mildness
of
repose
in
swiftness
invested
the
gliding
whale
not
the
white
bull
jupiter
swimming
away
with
ravished
europa
clinging
to
his
graceful
horns
his
lovely
leering
eyes
sideways
intent
upon
the
maid
with
smooth
bewitching
fleetness
rippling
straight
for
the
nuptial
bower
in
crete
not
jove
not
that
great
majesty
supreme
did
surpass
the
glorified
white
whale
as
he
so
divinely
swam
on
each
soft
side—coincident
with
the
parted
swell
that
but
once
leaving
him
then
flowed
so
wide
away—on
each
bright
side
the
whale
shed
off
enticings
no
wonder
there
had
been
some
among
the
hunters
who
namelessly
transported
and
allured
by
all
this
serenity
had
ventured
to
assail
it
but
had
fatally
found
that
quietude
but
the
vesture
of
tornadoes
yet
calm
enticing
calm
oh
whale
thou
glidest
on
to
all
who
for
the
first
time
eye
thee
no
matter
how
many
in
that
same
way
thou
may’st
have
bejuggled
and
destroyed
before
and
thus
through
the
serene
tranquillities
of
the
tropical
sea
among
waves
whose
hand-clappings
were
suspended
by
exceeding
rapture
moby
dick
moved
on
still
withholding
from
sight
the
full
terrors
of
his
submerged
trunk
entirely
hiding
the
wrenched
hideousness
of
his
jaw
but
soon
the
fore
part
of
him
slowly
rose
from
the
water
for
an
instant
his
whole
marbleized
body
formed
a
high
arch
like
virginia’s
natural
bridge
and
warningly
waving
his
bannered
flukes
in
the
air
the
grand
god
revealed
himself
sounded
and
went
out
of
sight
hoveringly
halting
and
dipping
on
the
wing
the
white
sea-fowls
longingly
lingered
over
the
agitated
pool
that
he
left
with
oars
apeak
and
paddles
down
the
sheets
of
their
sails
adrift
the
three
boats
now
stilly
floated
awaiting
moby
dick’s
reappearance
“an
hour,”
said
ahab
standing
rooted
in
his
boat’s
stern
and
he
gazed
beyond
the
whale’s
place
towards
the
dim
blue
spaces
and
wide
wooing
vacancies
to
leeward
it
was
only
an
instant
for
again
his
eyes
seemed
whirling
round
in
his
head
as
he
swept
the
watery
circle
the
breeze
now
freshened
the
sea
began
to
swell
“the
birds!—the
birds!”
cried
tashtego
in
long
indian
file
as
when
herons
take
wing
the
white
birds
were
now
all
flying
towards
ahab’s
boat
and
when
within
a
few
yards
began
fluttering
over
the
water
there
wheeling
round
and
round
with
joyous
expectant
cries
their
vision
was
keener
than
man’s
ahab
could
discover
no
sign
in
the
sea
but
suddenly
as
he
peered
down
and
down
into
its
depths
he
profoundly
saw
a
white
living
spot
no
bigger
than
a
white
weasel
with
wonderful
celerity
uprising
and
magnifying
as
it
rose
till
it
turned
and
then
there
were
plainly
revealed
two
long
crooked
rows
of
white
glistening
teeth
floating
up
from
the
undiscoverable
bottom
it
was
moby
dick’s
open
mouth
and
scrolled
jaw
his
vast
shadowed
bulk
still
half
blending
with
the
blue
of
the
sea
the
glittering
mouth
yawned
beneath
the
boat
like
an
open-doored
marble
tomb
and
giving
one
sidelong
sweep
with
his
steering
oar
ahab
whirled
the
craft
aside
from
this
tremendous
apparition
then
calling
upon
fedallah
to
change
places
with
him
went
forward
to
the
bows
and
seizing
perth’s
harpoon
commanded
his
crew
to
grasp
their
oars
and
stand
by
to
stern
now
by
reason
of
this
timely
spinning
round
the
boat
upon
its
axis
its
bow
by
anticipation
was
made
to
face
the
whale’s
head
while
yet
under
water
but
as
if
perceiving
this
stratagem
moby
dick
with
that
malicious
intelligence
ascribed
to
him
sidelingly
transplanted
himself
as
it
were
in
an
instant
shooting
his
pleated
head
lengthwise
beneath
the
boat
through
and
through
through
every
plank
and
each
rib
it
thrilled
for
an
instant
the
whale
obliquely
lying
on
his
back
in
the
manner
of
a
biting
shark
slowly
and
feelingly
taking
its
bows
full
within
his
mouth
so
that
the
long
narrow
scrolled
lower
jaw
curled
high
up
into
the
open
air
and
one
of
the
teeth
caught
in
a
row-lock
the
bluish
pearl-white
of
the
inside
of
the
jaw
was
within
six
inches
of
ahab’s
head
and
reached
higher
than
that
in
this
attitude
the
white
whale
now
shook
the
slight
cedar
as
a
mildly
cruel
cat
her
mouse
with
unastonished
eyes
fedallah
gazed
and
crossed
his
arms
but
the
tiger-yellow
crew
were
tumbling
over
each
other’s
heads
to
gain
the
uttermost
stern
and
now
while
both
elastic
gunwales
were
springing
in
and
out
as
the
whale
dallied
with
the
doomed
craft
in
this
devilish
way
and
from
his
body
being
submerged
beneath
the
boat
he
could
not
be
darted
at
from
the
bows
for
the
bows
were
almost
inside
of
him
as
it
were
and
while
the
other
boats
involuntarily
paused
as
before
a
quick
crisis
impossible
to
withstand
then
it
was
that
monomaniac
ahab
furious
with
this
tantalizing
vicinity
of
his
foe
which
placed
him
all
alive
and
helpless
in
the
very
jaws
he
hated
frenzied
with
all
this
he
seized
the
long
bone
with
his
naked
hands
and
wildly
strove
to
wrench
it
from
its
gripe
as
now
he
thus
vainly
strove
the
jaw
slipped
from
him
the
frail
gunwales
bent
in
collapsed
and
snapped
as
both
jaws
like
an
enormous
shears
sliding
further
aft
bit
the
craft
completely
in
twain
and
locked
themselves
fast
again
in
the
sea
midway
between
the
two
floating
wrecks
these
floated
aside
the
broken
ends
drooping
the
crew
at
the
stern-wreck
clinging
to
the
gunwales
and
striving
to
hold
fast
to
the
oars
to
lash
them
across
at
that
preluding
moment
ere
the
boat
was
yet
snapped
ahab
the
first
to
perceive
the
whale’s
intent
by
the
crafty
upraising
of
his
head
a
movement
that
loosed
his
hold
for
the
time
at
that
moment
his
hand
had
made
one
final
effort
to
push
the
boat
out
of
the
bite
but
only
slipping
further
into
the
whale’s
mouth
and
tilting
over
sideways
as
it
slipped
the
boat
had
shaken
off
his
hold
on
the
jaw
spilled
him
out
of
it
as
he
leaned
to
the
push
and
so
he
fell
flat-faced
upon
the
sea
ripplingly
withdrawing
from
his
prey
moby
dick
now
lay
at
a
little
distance
vertically
thrusting
his
oblong
white
head
up
and
down
in
the
billows
and
at
the
same
time
slowly
revolving
his
whole
spindled
body
so
that
when
his
vast
wrinkled
forehead
rose—some
twenty
or
more
feet
out
of
the
water—the
now
rising
swells
with
all
their
confluent
waves
dazzlingly
broke
against
it
vindictively
tossing
their
shivered
spray
still
higher
into
the
air.*
so
in
a
gale
the
but
half
baffled
channel
billows
only
recoil
from
the
base
of
the
eddystone
triumphantly
to
overleap
its
summit
with
their
scud
*this
motion
is
peculiar
to
the
sperm
whale
it
receives
its
designation
pitchpoling
from
its
being
likened
to
that
preliminary
up-and-down
poise
of
the
whale-lance
in
the
exercise
called
pitchpoling
previously
described
by
this
motion
the
whale
must
best
and
most
comprehensively
view
whatever
objects
may
be
encircling
him
but
soon
resuming
his
horizontal
attitude
moby
dick
swam
swiftly
round
and
round
the
wrecked
crew
sideways
churning
the
water
in
his
vengeful
wake
as
if
lashing
himself
up
to
still
another
and
more
deadly
assault
the
sight
of
the
splintered
boat
seemed
to
madden
him
as
the
blood
of
grapes
and
mulberries
cast
before
antiochus’s
elephants
in
the
book
of
maccabees
meanwhile
ahab
half
smothered
in
the
foam
of
the
whale’s
insolent
tail
and
too
much
of
a
cripple
to
swim,—though
he
could
still
keep
afloat
even
in
the
heart
of
such
a
whirlpool
as
that
helpless
ahab’s
head
was
seen
like
a
tossed
bubble
which
the
least
chance
shock
might
burst
from
the
boat’s
fragmentary
stern
fedallah
incuriously
and
mildly
eyed
him
the
clinging
crew
at
the
other
drifting
end
could
not
succor
him
more
than
enough
was
it
for
them
to
look
to
themselves
for
so
revolvingly
appalling
was
the
white
whale’s
aspect
and
so
planetarily
swift
the
ever-contracting
circles
he
made
that
he
seemed
horizontally
swooping
upon
them
and
though
the
other
boats
unharmed
still
hovered
hard
by
still
they
dared
not
pull
into
the
eddy
to
strike
lest
that
should
be
the
signal
for
the
instant
destruction
of
the
jeopardized
castaways
ahab
and
all
nor
in
that
case
could
they
themselves
hope
to
escape
with
straining
eyes
then
they
remained
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
direful
zone
whose
centre
had
now
become
the
old
man’s
head
meantime
from
the
beginning
all
this
had
been
descried
from
the
ship’s
mast
heads
and
squaring
her
yards
she
had
borne
down
upon
the
scene
and
was
now
so
nigh
that
ahab
in
the
water
hailed
her!—“sail
on
the”—but
that
moment
a
breaking
sea
dashed
on
him
from
moby
dick
and
whelmed
him
for
the
time
but
struggling
out
of
it
again
and
chancing
to
rise
on
a
towering
crest
he
shouted,—“sail
on
the
whale!—drive
him
off!”
the
pequod’s
prows
were
pointed
and
breaking
up
the
charmed
circle
she
effectually
parted
the
white
whale
from
his
victim
as
he
sullenly
swam
off
the
boats
flew
to
the
rescue
dragged
into
stubb’s
boat
with
blood-shot
blinded
eyes
the
white
brine
caking
in
his
wrinkles
the
long
tension
of
ahab’s
bodily
strength
did
crack
and
helplessly
he
yielded
to
his
body’s
doom
for
a
time
lying
all
crushed
in
the
bottom
of
stubb’s
boat
like
one
trodden
under
foot
of
herds
of
elephants
far
inland
nameless
wails
came
from
him
as
desolate
sounds
from
out
ravines
but
this
intensity
of
his
physical
prostration
did
but
so
much
the
more
abbreviate
it
in
an
instant’s
compass
great
hearts
sometimes
condense
to
one
deep
pang
the
sum
total
of
those
shallow
pains
kindly
diffused
through
feebler
men’s
whole
lives
and
so
such
hearts
though
summary
in
each
one
suffering
still
if
the
gods
decree
it
in
their
life-time
aggregate
a
whole
age
of
woe
wholly
made
up
of
instantaneous
intensities
for
even
in
their
pointless
centres
those
noble
natures
contain
the
entire
circumferences
of
inferior
souls
“the
harpoon,”
said
ahab
half
way
rising
and
draggingly
leaning
on
one
bended
arm—“is
it
safe?”
“aye
sir
for
it
was
not
darted
this
is
it,”
said
stubb
showing
it
“lay
it
before
me;—any
missing
men?”
“one
two
three
four
five;—there
were
five
oars
sir
and
here
are
five
men.”
“that’s
good.—help
me
man
i
wish
to
stand
so
so
i
see
him
there
there
going
to
leeward
still
what
a
leaping
spout!—hands
off
from
me
the
eternal
sap
runs
up
in
ahab’s
bones
again

it
is
often
the
case
that
when
a
boat
is
stove
its
crew
being
picked
up
by
another
boat
help
to
work
that
second
boat
and
the
chase
is
thus
continued
with
what
is
called
double-banked
oars
it
was
thus
now
but
the
added
power
of
the
boat
did
not
equal
the
added
power
of
the
whale
for
he
seemed
to
have
treble-banked
his
every
fin
swimming
with
a
velocity
which
plainly
showed
that
if
now
under
these
circumstances
pushed
on
the
chase
would
prove
an
indefinitely
prolonged
if
not
a
hopeless
one
nor
could
any
crew
endure
for
so
long
a
period
such
an
unintermitted
intense
straining
at
the
oar
a
thing
barely
tolerable
only
in
some
one
brief
vicissitude
the
ship
itself
then
as
it
sometimes
happens
offered
the
most
promising
intermediate
means
of
overtaking
the
chase
accordingly
the
boats
now
made
for
her
and
were
soon
swayed
up
to
their
cranes—the
two
parts
of
the
wrecked
boat
having
been
previously
secured
by
her—and
then
hoisting
everything
to
her
side
and
stacking
her
canvas
high
up
and
sideways
outstretching
it
with
stun-sails
like
the
double-jointed
wings
of
an
albatross
the
pequod
bore
down
in
the
leeward
wake
of
moby-dick
at
the
well
known
methodic
intervals
the
whale’s
glittering
spout
was
regularly
announced
from
the
manned
mast-heads
and
when
he
would
be
reported
as
just
gone
down
ahab
would
take
the
time
and
then
pacing
the
deck
binnacle-watch
in
hand
so
soon
as
the
last
second
of
the
allotted
hour
expired
his
voice
was
heard.—“whose
is
the
doubloon
now
d’ye
see
him?”
and
if
the
reply
was
no
sir
straightway
he
commanded
them
to
lift
him
to
his
perch
in
this
way
the
day
wore
on
ahab
now
aloft
and
motionless
anon
unrestingly
pacing
the
planks
as
he
was
thus
walking
uttering
no
sound
except
to
hail
the
men
aloft
or
to
bid
them
hoist
a
sail
still
higher
or
to
spread
one
to
a
still
greater
breadth—thus
to
and
fro
pacing
beneath
his
slouched
hat
at
every
turn
he
passed
his
own
wrecked
boat
which
had
been
dropped
upon
the
quarter-deck
and
lay
there
reversed
broken
bow
to
shattered
stern
at
last
he
paused
before
it
and
as
in
an
already
over-clouded
sky
fresh
troops
of
clouds
will
sometimes
sail
across
so
over
the
old
man’s
face
there
now
stole
some
such
added
gloom
as
this
stubb
saw
him
pause
and
perhaps
intending
not
vainly
though
to
evince
his
own
unabated
fortitude
and
thus
keep
up
a
valiant
place
in
his
captain’s
mind
he
advanced
and
eyeing
the
wreck
exclaimed—“the
thistle
the
ass
refused
it
pricked
his
mouth
too
keenly
sir
ha
ha!”
“what
soulless
thing
is
this
that
laughs
before
a
wreck
man
man
did
i
not
know
thee
brave
as
fearless
fire
and
as
mechanical
i
could
swear
thou
wert
a
poltroon
groan
nor
laugh
should
be
heard
before
a
wreck.”
“aye
sir,”
said
starbuck
drawing
near
“’tis
a
solemn
sight
an
omen
and
an
ill
one.”
“omen
omen?—the
dictionary
if
the
gods
think
to
speak
outright
to
man
they
will
honorably
speak
outright
not
shake
their
heads
and
give
an
old
wives’
darkling
hint.—begone
ye
two
are
the
opposite
poles
of
one
thing
starbuck
is
stubb
reversed
and
stubb
is
starbuck
and
ye
two
are
all
mankind
and
ahab
stands
alone
among
the
millions
of
the
peopled
earth
nor
gods
nor
men
his
neighbors
cold
cold—i
shiver!—how
now
aloft
there
d’ye
see
him
sing
out
for
every
spout
though
he
spout
ten
times
a
second!”
the
day
was
nearly
done
only
the
hem
of
his
golden
robe
was
rustling
soon
it
was
almost
dark
but
the
look-out
men
still
remained
unset
“can’t
see
the
spout
now
sir;—too
dark”—cried
a
voice
from
the
air
“how
heading
when
last
seen?”
“as
before
sir,—straight
to
leeward.”
“good
he
will
travel
slower
now
’tis
night
down
royals
and
top-gallant
stun-sails
mr
starbuck
we
must
not
run
over
him
before
morning
he’s
making
a
passage
now
and
may
heave-to
a
while
helm
there
keep
her
full
before
the
wind!—aloft
come
down!—mr
stubb
send
a
fresh
hand
to
the
fore-mast
head
and
see
it
manned
till
morning.”—then
advancing
towards
the
doubloon
in
the
main-mast—“men
this
gold
is
mine
for
i
earned
it
but
i
shall
let
it
abide
here
till
the
white
whale
is
dead
and
then
whosoever
of
ye
first
raises
him
upon
the
day
he
shall
be
killed
this
gold
is
that
man’s
and
if
on
that
day
i
shall
again
raise
him
then
ten
times
its
sum
shall
be
divided
among
all
of
ye
away
now!—the
deck
is
thine
sir!”
and
so
saying
he
placed
himself
half
way
within
the
scuttle
and
slouching
his
hat
stood
there
till
dawn
except
when
at
intervals
rousing
himself
to
see
how
the
night
wore
on
chapter
134
the
chase—second
day
at
day-break
the
three
mast-heads
were
punctually
manned
afresh
“d’ye
see
him?”
cried
ahab
after
allowing
a
little
space
for
the
light
to
spread
“see
nothing
sir.”
“turn
up
all
hands
and
make
sail
he
travels
faster
than
i
thought
for;—the
top-gallant
sails!—aye
they
should
have
been
kept
on
her
all
night
but
no
matter—’tis
but
resting
for
the
rush.”
here
be
it
said
that
this
pertinacious
pursuit
of
one
particular
whale
continued
through
day
into
night
and
through
night
into
day
is
a
thing
by
no
means
unprecedented
in
the
south
sea
fishery
for
such
is
the
wonderful
skill
prescience
of
experience
and
invincible
confidence
acquired
by
some
great
natural
geniuses
among
the
nantucket
commanders
that
from
the
simple
observation
of
a
whale
when
last
descried
they
will
under
certain
given
circumstances
pretty
accurately
foretell
both
the
direction
in
which
he
will
continue
to
swim
for
a
time
while
out
of
sight
as
well
as
his
probable
rate
of
progression
during
that
period
and
in
these
cases
somewhat
as
a
pilot
when
about
losing
sight
of
a
coast
whose
general
trending
he
well
knows
and
which
he
desires
shortly
to
return
to
again
but
at
some
further
point
like
as
this
pilot
stands
by
his
compass
and
takes
the
precise
bearing
of
the
cape
at
present
visible
in
order
the
more
certainly
to
hit
aright
the
remote
unseen
headland
eventually
to
be
visited
so
does
the
fisherman
at
his
compass
with
the
whale
for
after
being
chased
and
diligently
marked
through
several
hours
of
daylight
then
when
night
obscures
the
fish
the
creature’s
future
wake
through
the
darkness
is
almost
as
established
to
the
sagacious
mind
of
the
hunter
as
the
pilot’s
coast
is
to
him
so
that
to
this
hunter’s
wondrous
skill
the
proverbial
evanescence
of
a
thing
writ
in
water
a
wake
is
to
all
desired
purposes
well
nigh
as
reliable
as
the
steadfast
land
and
as
the
mighty
iron
leviathan
of
the
modern
railway
is
so
familiarly
known
in
its
every
pace
that
with
watches
in
their
hands
men
time
his
rate
as
doctors
that
of
a
baby’s
pulse
and
lightly
say
of
it
the
up
train
or
the
down
train
will
reach
such
or
such
a
spot
at
such
or
such
an
hour
even
so
almost
there
are
occasions
when
these
nantucketers
time
that
other
leviathan
of
the
deep
according
to
the
observed
humor
of
his
speed
and
say
to
themselves
so
many
hours
hence
this
whale
will
have
gone
two
hundred
miles
will
have
about
reached
this
or
that
degree
of
latitude
or
longitude
but
to
render
this
acuteness
at
all
successful
in
the
end
the
wind
and
the
sea
must
be
the
whaleman’s
allies
for
of
what
present
avail
to
the
becalmed
or
windbound
mariner
is
the
skill
that
assures
him
he
is
exactly
ninety-three
leagues
and
a
quarter
from
his
port
inferable
from
these
statements
are
many
collateral
subtile
matters
touching
the
chase
of
whales
the
ship
tore
on
leaving
such
a
furrow
in
the
sea
as
when
a
cannon-ball
missent
becomes
a
plough-share
and
turns
up
the
level
field
“by
salt
and
hemp!”
cried
stubb
“but
this
swift
motion
of
the
deck
creeps
up
one’s
legs
and
tingles
at
the
heart
this
ship
and
i
are
two
brave
fellows!—ha
ha
some
one
take
me
up
and
launch
me
spine-wise
on
the
sea,—for
by
live-oaks
my
spine’s
a
keel
ha
ha
we
go
the
gait
that
leaves
no
dust
behind!”
“there
she
blows—she
blows!—she
blows!—right
ahead!”
was
now
the
mast-head
cry
“aye
aye!”
cried
stubb
“i
knew
it—ye
can’t
escape—blow
on
and
split
your
spout
o
whale
the
mad
fiend
himself
is
after
ye
blow
your
trump—blister
your
lungs!—ahab
will
dam
off
your
blood
as
a
miller
shuts
his
watergate
upon
the
stream!”
and
stubb
did
but
speak
out
for
well
nigh
all
that
crew
the
frenzies
of
the
chase
had
by
this
time
worked
them
bubblingly
up
like
old
wine
worked
anew
whatever
pale
fears
and
forebodings
some
of
them
might
have
felt
before
these
were
not
only
now
kept
out
of
sight
through
the
growing
awe
of
ahab
but
they
were
broken
up
and
on
all
sides
routed
as
timid
prairie
hares
that
scatter
before
the
bounding
bison
the
hand
of
fate
had
snatched
all
their
souls
and
by
the
stirring
perils
of
the
previous
day
the
rack
of
the
past
night’s
suspense
the
fixed
unfearing
blind
reckless
way
in
which
their
wild
craft
went
plunging
towards
its
flying
mark
by
all
these
things
their
hearts
were
bowled
along
the
wind
that
made
great
bellies
of
their
sails
and
rushed
the
vessel
on
by
arms
invisible
as
irresistible
this
seemed
the
symbol
of
that
unseen
agency
which
so
enslaved
them
to
the
race
they
were
one
man
not
thirty
for
as
the
one
ship
that
held
them
all
though
it
was
put
together
of
all
contrasting
things—oak
and
maple
and
pine
wood
iron
and
pitch
and
hemp—yet
all
these
ran
into
each
other
in
the
one
concrete
hull
which
shot
on
its
way
both
balanced
and
directed
by
the
long
central
keel
even
so
all
the
individualities
of
the
crew
this
man’s
valor
that
man’s
fear
guilt
and
guiltiness
all
varieties
were
welded
into
oneness
and
were
all
directed
to
that
fatal
goal
which
ahab
their
one
lord
and
keel
did
point
to
the
rigging
lived
the
mast-heads
like
the
tops
of
tall
palms
were
outspreadingly
tufted
with
arms
and
legs
clinging
to
a
spar
with
one
hand
some
reached
forth
the
other
with
impatient
wavings
others
shading
their
eyes
from
the
vivid
sunlight
sat
far
out
on
the
rocking
yards
all
the
spars
in
full
bearing
of
mortals
ready
and
ripe
for
their
fate
ah
how
they
still
strove
through
that
infinite
blueness
to
seek
out
the
thing
that
might
destroy
them
“why
sing
ye
not
out
for
him
if
ye
see
him?”
cried
ahab
when
after
the
lapse
of
some
minutes
since
the
first
cry
no
more
had
been
heard
“sway
me
up
men
ye
have
been
deceived
not
moby
dick
casts
one
odd
jet
that
way
and
then
disappears.”
it
was
even
so
in
their
headlong
eagerness
the
men
had
mistaken
some
other
thing
for
the
whale-spout
as
the
event
itself
soon
proved
for
hardly
had
ahab
reached
his
perch
hardly
was
the
rope
belayed
to
its
pin
on
deck
when
he
struck
the
key-note
to
an
orchestra
that
made
the
air
vibrate
as
with
the
combined
discharges
of
rifles
the
triumphant
halloo
of
thirty
buckskin
lungs
was
heard
as—much
nearer
to
the
ship
than
the
place
of
the
imaginary
jet
less
than
a
mile
ahead—moby
dick
bodily
burst
into
view
for
not
by
any
calm
and
indolent
spoutings
not
by
the
peaceable
gush
of
that
mystic
fountain
in
his
head
did
the
white
whale
now
reveal
his
vicinity
but
by
the
far
more
wondrous
phenomenon
of
breaching
rising
with
his
utmost
velocity
from
the
furthest
depths
the
sperm
whale
thus
booms
his
entire
bulk
into
the
pure
element
of
air
and
piling
up
a
mountain
of
dazzling
foam
shows
his
place
to
the
distance
of
seven
miles
and
more
in
those
moments
the
torn
enraged
waves
he
shakes
off
seem
his
mane
in
some
cases
this
breaching
is
his
act
of
defiance
“there
she
breaches
there
she
breaches!”
was
the
cry
as
in
his
immeasurable
bravadoes
the
white
whale
tossed
himself
salmon-like
to
heaven
so
suddenly
seen
in
the
blue
plain
of
the
sea
and
relieved
against
the
still
bluer
margin
of
the
sky
the
spray
that
he
raised
for
the
moment
intolerably
glittered
and
glared
like
a
glacier
and
stood
there
gradually
fading
and
fading
away
from
its
first
sparkling
intensity
to
the
dim
mistiness
of
an
advancing
shower
in
a
vale
“aye
breach
your
last
to
the
sun
moby
dick!”
cried
ahab
“thy
hour
and
thy
harpoon
are
at
hand!—down
down
all
of
ye
but
one
man
at
the
fore
the
boats!—stand
by!”
unmindful
of
the
tedious
rope-ladders
of
the
shrouds
the
men
like
shooting
stars
slid
to
the
deck
by
the
isolated
backstays
and
halyards
while
ahab
less
dartingly
but
still
rapidly
was
dropped
from
his
perch
“lower
away,”
he
cried
so
soon
as
he
had
reached
his
boat—a
spare
one
rigged
the
afternoon
previous
“mr
starbuck
the
ship
is
thine—keep
away
from
the
boats
but
keep
near
them
lower
all!”
as
if
to
strike
a
quick
terror
into
them
by
this
time
being
the
first
assailant
himself
moby
dick
had
turned
and
was
now
coming
for
the
three
crews
ahab’s
boat
was
central
and
cheering
his
men
he
told
them
he
would
take
the
whale
head-and-head,—that
is
pull
straight
up
to
his
forehead,—a
not
uncommon
thing
for
when
within
a
certain
limit
such
a
course
excludes
the
coming
onset
from
the
whale’s
sidelong
vision
but
ere
that
close
limit
was
gained
and
while
yet
all
three
boats
were
plain
as
the
ship’s
three
masts
to
his
eye
the
white
whale
churning
himself
into
furious
speed
almost
in
an
instant
as
it
were
rushing
among
the
boats
with
open
jaws
and
a
lashing
tail
offered
appalling
battle
on
every
side
and
heedless
of
the
irons
darted
at
him
from
every
boat
seemed
only
intent
on
annihilating
each
separate
plank
of
which
those
boats
were
made
but
skilfully
manœuvred
incessantly
wheeling
like
trained
chargers
in
the
field
the
boats
for
a
while
eluded
him
though
at
times
but
by
a
plank’s
breadth
while
all
the
time
ahab’s
unearthly
slogan
tore
every
other
cry
but
his
to
shreds
but
at
last
in
his
untraceable
evolutions
the
white
whale
so
crossed
and
recrossed
and
in
a
thousand
ways
entangled
the
slack
of
the
three
lines
now
fast
to
him
that
they
foreshortened
and
of
themselves
warped
the
devoted
boats
towards
the
planted
irons
in
him
though
now
for
a
moment
the
whale
drew
aside
a
little
as
if
to
rally
for
a
more
tremendous
charge
seizing
that
opportunity
ahab
first
paid
out
more
line
and
then
was
rapidly
hauling
and
jerking
in
upon
it
again—hoping
that
way
to
disencumber
it
of
some
snarls—when
lo!—a
sight
more
savage
than
the
embattled
teeth
of
sharks
caught
and
twisted—corkscrewed
in
the
mazes
of
the
line
loose
harpoons
and
lances
with
all
their
bristling
barbs
and
points
came
flashing
and
dripping
up
to
the
chocks
in
the
bows
of
ahab’s
boat
only
one
thing
could
be
done
seizing
the
boat-knife
he
critically
reached
within—through—and
then
without—the
rays
of
steel
dragged
in
the
line
beyond
passed
it
inboard
to
the
bowsman
and
then
twice
sundering
the
rope
near
the
chocks—dropped
the
intercepted
fagot
of
steel
into
the
sea
and
was
all
fast
again
that
instant
the
white
whale
made
a
sudden
rush
among
the
remaining
tangles
of
the
other
lines
by
so
doing
irresistibly
dragged
the
more
involved
boats
of
stubb
and
flask
towards
his
flukes
dashed
them
together
like
two
rolling
husks
on
a
surf-beaten
beach
and
then
diving
down
into
the
sea
disappeared
in
a
boiling
maelstrom
in
which
for
a
space
the
odorous
cedar
chips
of
the
wrecks
danced
round
and
round
like
the
grated
nutmeg
in
a
swiftly
stirred
bowl
of
punch
while
the
two
crews
were
yet
circling
in
the
waters
reaching
out
after
the
revolving
line-tubs
oars
and
other
floating
furniture
while
aslope
little
flask
bobbed
up
and
down
like
an
empty
vial
twitching
his
legs
upwards
to
escape
the
dreaded
jaws
of
sharks
and
stubb
was
lustily
singing
out
for
some
one
to
ladle
him
up
and
while
the
old
man’s
line—now
parting—admitted
of
his
pulling
into
the
creamy
pool
to
rescue
whom
he
could;—in
that
wild
simultaneousness
of
a
thousand
concreted
perils,—ahab’s
yet
unstricken
boat
seemed
drawn
up
towards
heaven
by
invisible
wires,—as
arrow-like
shooting
perpendicularly
from
the
sea
the
white
whale
dashed
his
broad
forehead
against
its
bottom
and
sent
it
turning
over
and
over
into
the
air
till
it
fell
again—gunwale
downwards—and
ahab
and
his
men
struggled
out
from
under
it
like
seals
from
a
sea-side
cave
the
first
uprising
momentum
of
the
whale—modifying
its
direction
as
he
struck
the
surface—involuntarily
launched
him
along
it
to
a
little
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
destruction
he
had
made
and
with
his
back
to
it
he
now
lay
for
a
moment
slowly
feeling
with
his
flukes
from
side
to
side
and
whenever
a
stray
oar
bit
of
plank
the
least
chip
or
crumb
of
the
boats
touched
his
skin
his
tail
swiftly
drew
back
and
came
sideways
smiting
the
sea
but
soon
as
if
satisfied
that
his
work
for
that
time
was
done
he
pushed
his
pleated
forehead
through
the
ocean
and
trailing
after
him
the
intertangled
lines
continued
his
leeward
way
at
a
traveller’s
methodic
pace
as
before
the
attentive
ship
having
descried
the
whole
fight
again
came
bearing
down
to
the
rescue
and
dropping
a
boat
picked
up
the
floating
mariners
tubs
oars
and
whatever
else
could
be
caught
at
and
safely
landed
them
on
her
decks
some
sprained
shoulders
wrists
and
ankles
livid
contusions
wrenched
harpoons
and
lances
inextricable
intricacies
of
rope
shattered
oars
and
planks
all
these
were
there
but
no
fatal
or
even
serious
ill
seemed
to
have
befallen
any
one
as
with
fedallah
the
day
before
so
ahab
was
now
found
grimly
clinging
to
his
boat’s
broken
half
which
afforded
a
comparatively
easy
float
nor
did
it
so
exhaust
him
as
the
previous
day’s
mishap
but
when
he
was
helped
to
the
deck
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him
as
instead
of
standing
by
himself
he
still
half-hung
upon
the
shoulder
of
starbuck
who
had
thus
far
been
the
foremost
to
assist
him
his
ivory
leg
had
been
snapped
off
leaving
but
one
short
sharp
splinter
“aye
aye
starbuck
’tis
sweet
to
lean
sometimes
be
the
leaner
who
he
will
and
would
old
ahab
had
leaned
oftener
than
he
has.”
“the
ferrule
has
not
stood
sir,”
said
the
carpenter
now
coming
up
“i
put
good
work
into
that
leg.”
“but
no
bones
broken
sir
i
hope,”
said
stubb
with
true
concern
“aye
and
all
splintered
to
pieces
stubb!—d’ye
see
it.—but
even
with
a
broken
bone
old
ahab
is
untouched
and
i
account
no
living
bone
of
mine
one
jot
more
me
than
this
dead
one
that’s
lost
nor
white
whale
nor
man
nor
fiend
can
so
much
as
graze
old
ahab
in
his
own
proper
and
inaccessible
being
can
any
lead
touch
yonder
floor
any
mast
scrape
yonder
roof?—aloft
there
which
way?”
“dead
to
leeward
sir.”
“up
helm
then
pile
on
the
sail
again
ship
keepers
down
the
rest
of
the
spare
boats
and
rig
them—mr
starbuck
away
and
muster
the
boat’s
crews.”
“let
me
first
help
thee
towards
the
bulwarks
sir.”
“oh
oh
oh
how
this
splinter
gores
me
now
accursed
fate
that
the
unconquerable
captain
in
the
soul
should
have
such
a
craven
mate!”
“sir?”
“my
body
man
not
thee
give
me
something
for
a
cane—there
that
shivered
lance
will
do
muster
the
men
surely
i
have
not
seen
him
yet
by
heaven
it
cannot
be!—missing?—quick
call
them
all.”
the
old
man’s
hinted
thought
was
true
upon
mustering
the
company
the
parsee
was
not
there
“the
parsee!”
cried
stubb—“he
must
have
been
caught
in——”
“the
black
vomit
wrench
thee!—run
all
of
ye
above
alow
cabin
forecastle—find
him—not
gone—not
gone!”
but
quickly
they
returned
to
him
with
the
tidings
that
the
parsee
was
nowhere
to
be
found
“aye
sir,”
said
stubb—“caught
among
the
tangles
of
your
line—i
thought
i
saw
him
dragging
under.”
“_my_
line
_my_
line
gone?—gone
what
means
that
little
word?—what
death-knell
rings
in
it
that
old
ahab
shakes
as
if
he
were
the
belfry
the
harpoon
too!—toss
over
the
litter
there,—d’ye
see
it?—the
forged
iron
men
the
white
whale’s—no
no
no,—blistered
fool
this
hand
did
dart
it!—’tis
in
the
fish!—aloft
there
keep
him
nailed—quick!—all
hands
to
the
rigging
of
the
boats—collect
the
oars—harpooneers
the
irons
the
irons!—hoist
the
royals
higher—a
pull
on
all
the
sheets!—helm
there
steady
steady
for
your
life
i’ll
ten
times
girdle
the
unmeasured
globe
yea
and
dive
straight
through
it
but
i’ll
slay
him
yet!”
“great
god
but
for
one
single
instant
show
thyself,”
cried
starbuck
“never
never
wilt
thou
capture
him
old
man—in
jesus’
name
no
more
of
this
that’s
worse
than
devil’s
madness
two
days
chased
twice
stove
to
splinters
thy
very
leg
once
more
snatched
from
under
thee
thy
evil
shadow
gone—all
good
angels
mobbing
thee
with
warnings:—what
more
wouldst
thou
have?—shall
we
keep
chasing
this
murderous
fish
till
he
swamps
the
last
man
shall
we
be
dragged
by
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
shall
we
be
towed
by
him
to
the
infernal
world
oh
oh,—impiety
and
blasphemy
to
hunt
him
more!”
“starbuck
of
late
i’ve
felt
strangely
moved
to
thee
ever
since
that
hour
we
both
saw—thou
know’st
what
in
one
another’s
eyes
but
in
this
matter
of
the
whale
be
the
front
of
thy
face
to
me
as
the
palm
of
this
hand—a
lipless
unfeatured
blank
ahab
is
for
ever
ahab

this
whole
act’s
immutably
decreed
’twas
rehearsed
by
thee
and
me
a
billion
years
before
this
ocean
rolled

i
am
the
fates’
lieutenant
i
act
under

look
thou
underling
that
thou
obeyest

round
me
men
ye
see
an
old
man
cut
down
to
the
stump
leaning
on
a
shivered
lance
propped
up
on
a
lonely
foot
’tis
ahab—his
body’s
part
but
ahab’s
soul’s
a
centipede
that
moves
upon
a
hundred
legs
i
feel
strained
half
stranded
as
ropes
that
tow
dismasted
frigates
in
a
gale
and
i
may
look
so
but
ere
i
break
ye’ll
hear
me
crack
and
till
ye
hear
_that_
know
that
ahab’s
hawser
tows
his
purpose
yet
believe
ye
men
in
the
things
called
omens
then
laugh
aloud
and
cry
encore
for
ere
they
drown
drowning
things
will
twice
rise
to
the
surface
then
rise
again
to
sink
for
evermore
so
with
moby
dick—two
days
he’s
floated—tomorrow
will
be
the
third
aye
men
he’ll
rise
once
more,—but
only
to
spout
his
last
d’ye
feel
brave
men
brave?”
“as
fearless
fire,”
cried
stubb
“and
as
mechanical,”
muttered
ahab
then
as
the
men
went
forward
he
muttered
on
“the
things
called
omens
and
yesterday
i
talked
the
same
to
starbuck
there
concerning
my
broken
boat
oh
how
valiantly
i
seek
to
drive
out
of
others’
hearts
what’s
clinched
so
fast
in
mine!—the
parsee—the
parsee!—gone
gone
and
he
was
to
go
before:—but
still
was
to
be
seen
again
ere
i
could
perish—how’s
that?—there’s
a
riddle
now
might
baffle
all
the
lawyers
backed
by
the
ghosts
of
the
whole
line
of
judges:—like
a
hawk’s
beak
it
pecks
my
brain
_i’ll_
_i’ll_
solve
it
though!”
when
dusk
descended
the
whale
was
still
in
sight
to
leeward
so
once
more
the
sail
was
shortened
and
everything
passed
nearly
as
on
the
previous
night
only
the
sound
of
hammers
and
the
hum
of
the
grindstone
was
heard
till
nearly
daylight
as
the
men
toiled
by
lanterns
in
the
complete
and
careful
rigging
of
the
spare
boats
and
sharpening
their
fresh
weapons
for
the
morrow
meantime
of
the
broken
keel
of
ahab’s
wrecked
craft
the
carpenter
made
him
another
leg
while
still
as
on
the
night
before
slouched
ahab
stood
fixed
within
his
scuttle
his
hid
heliotrope
glance
anticipatingly
gone
backward
on
its
dial
sat
due
eastward
for
the
earliest

the
chase.—third
day
the
morning
of
the
third
day
dawned
fair
and
fresh
and
once
more
the
solitary
night-man
at
the
fore-mast-head
was
relieved
by
crowds
of
the
daylight
look-outs
who
dotted
every
mast
and
almost
every
spar
“d’ye
see
him?”
cried
ahab
but
the
whale
was
not
yet
in
sight
“in
his
infallible
wake
though
but
follow
that
wake
that’s
all
helm
there
steady
as
thou
goest
and
hast
been
going
what
a
lovely
day
again
were
it
a
new-made
world
and
made
for
a
summer-house
to
the
angels
and
this
morning
the
first
of
its
throwing
open
to
them
a
fairer
day
could
not
dawn
upon
that
world
here’s
food
for
thought
had
ahab
time
to
think
but
ahab
never
thinks
he
only
feels
feels
feels
_that’s_
tingling
enough
for
mortal
man
to
think’s
audacity
god
only
has
that
right
and
privilege
thinking
is
or
ought
to
be
a
coolness
and
a
calmness
and
our
poor
hearts
throb
and
our
poor
brains
beat
too
much
for
that
and
yet
i’ve
sometimes
thought
my
brain
was
very
calm—frozen
calm
this
old
skull
cracks
so
like
a
glass
in
which
the
contents
turned
to
ice
and
shiver
it
and
still
this
hair
is
growing
now
this
moment
growing
and
heat
must
breed
it
but
no
it’s
like
that
sort
of
common
grass
that
will
grow
anywhere
between
the
earthy
clefts
of
greenland
ice
or
in
vesuvius
lava
how
the
wild
winds
blow
it
they
whip
it
about
me
as
the
torn
shreds
of
split
sails
lash
the
tossed
ship
they
cling
to
a
vile
wind
that
has
no
doubt
blown
ere
this
through
prison
corridors
and
cells
and
wards
of
hospitals
and
ventilated
them
and
now
comes
blowing
hither
as
innocent
as
fleeces
out
upon
it!—it’s
tainted
were
i
the
wind
i’d
blow
no
more
on
such
a
wicked
miserable
world
i’d
crawl
somewhere
to
a
cave
and
slink
there
and
yet
’tis
a
noble
and
heroic
thing
the
wind
who
ever
conquered
it
in
every
fight
it
has
the
last
and
bitterest
blow
run
tilting
at
it
and
you
but
run
through
it
ha
a
coward
wind
that
strikes
stark
naked
men
but
will
not
stand
to
receive
a
single
blow
even
ahab
is
a
braver
thing—a
nobler
thing
than
_that_
would
now
the
wind
but
had
a
body
but
all
the
things
that
most
exasperate
and
outrage
mortal
man
all
these
things
are
bodiless
but
only
bodiless
as
objects
not
as
agents
there’s
a
most
special
a
most
cunning
oh
a
most
malicious
difference
and
yet
i
say
again
and
swear
it
now
that
there’s
something
all
glorious
and
gracious
in
the
wind
these
warm
trade
winds
at
least
that
in
the
clear
heavens
blow
straight
on
in
strong
and
steadfast
vigorous
mildness
and
veer
not
from
their
mark
however
the
baser
currents
of
the
sea
may
turn
and
tack
and
mightiest
mississippies
of
the
land
swift
and
swerve
about
uncertain
where
to
go
at
last
and
by
the
eternal
poles
these
same
trades
that
so
directly
blow
my
good
ship
on
these
trades
or
something
like
them—something
so
unchangeable
and
full
as
strong
blow
my
keeled
soul
along
to
it
aloft
there
what
d’ye
see?”
“nothing
sir.”
“nothing
and
noon
at
hand
the
doubloon
goes
a-begging
see
the
sun
aye
aye
it
must
be
so
i’ve
oversailed
him
how
got
the

he’s
chasing
_me_
now
not
i
_him_—that’s
bad
i
might

by

night

down

of
ye
but
the
regular
look
outs

the
braces!”
steering
as
she
had
done
the
wind
had
been
somewhat
on
the
pequod’s
quarter
so
that
now
being
pointed
in
the
reverse
direction
the
braced
ship
sailed
hard
upon
the
breeze
as
she
rechurned
the
cream
in
her
own
white
wake
“against
the
wind
he
now
steers
for
the
open
jaw,”
murmured
starbuck
to
himself
as
he
coiled
the
new-hauled
main-brace
upon
the
rail
“god
keep
us
but
already
my
bones
feel
damp
within
me
and
from
the
inside
wet
my
flesh
i
misdoubt
me
that
i
disobey
my
god
in
obeying
him!”
“stand
by
to
sway
me
up!”
cried
ahab
advancing
to
the
hempen
basket
“we
should
meet
him
soon.”
“aye
aye
sir,”
and
straightway
starbuck
did
ahab’s
bidding
and
once
more
ahab
swung
on
high
a
whole
hour
now
passed
gold-beaten
out
to
ages
time
itself
now
held
long
breaths
with
keen
suspense
but
at
last
some
three
points
off
the
weather
bow
ahab
descried
the
spout
again
and
instantly
from
the
three
mast-heads
three
shrieks
went
up
as
if
the
tongues
of
fire
had
voiced
it
“forehead
to
forehead
i
meet
thee
this
third
time
moby
dick
on
deck
there!—brace
sharper
up
crowd
her
into
the
wind’s
eye
he’s
too
far
off
to
lower
yet
mr
starbuck
the
sails
shake
stand
over
that
helmsman
with
a
top-maul
so
so
he
travels
fast
and
i
must
down
but
let
me
have
one
more
good
round
look
aloft
here
at
the
sea
there’s
time
for
that
an
old
old
sight
and
yet
somehow
so
young
aye
and
not
changed
a
wink
since
i
first
saw
it
a
boy
from
the
sand-hills
of
nantucket
the
same!—the
same!—the
same
to
noah
as
to
me
there’s
a
soft
shower
to
leeward
such
lovely
leewardings
they
must
lead
somewhere—to
something
else
than
common
land
more
palmy
than
the
palms
leeward
the
white
whale
goes
that
way

to
windward

the
better

the
bitterer
quarter

good
bye
good
bye

mast-head
what’s
this?—green
aye
tiny
mosses
in
these
warped
cracks
no
such
green
weather
stains
on
ahab’s
head
there’s
the
difference
now
between
man’s
old
age
and
matter’s
but
aye
old

we
both
grow
old
together
sound
in
our
hulls

all
by
heaven
this
dead
wood
has
the
better
of
my
live
flesh
every
way
i
can’t
compare
with
it
and
i’ve
known
some
ships
made
of
dead
trees
outlast
the
lives
of
men
made
of
the
most
vital
stuff
of
vital
fathers
what’s
that
he
said
he
should
still
go
before
me
my
pilot
and
yet
to
be
seen
again
but
where
will
i
have
eyes
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
supposing
i
descend
those
endless
stairs
and
all
night
i’ve
been
sailing
from
him

he
did
sink

aye
like
many
more
thou
told’st
direful
truth

ahab
there
thy
shot
fell
short
good-bye

a
good
eye
upon
the
whale
the
while
i’m
gone
we’ll
talk
to-morrow
nay
to-night
when
the
white
whale
lies
down
there
tied
by

and
tail.”
he
gave
the
word
and
still
gazing
round
him
was
steadily
lowered
through
the
cloven
blue
air
to
the
deck
in
due
time
the
boats
were
lowered
but
as
standing
in
his
shallop’s
stern
ahab
just
hovered
upon
the
point
of
the
descent
he
waved
to
the
mate,—who
held
one
of
the
tackle-ropes
on
deck—and
bade
him
pause
“starbuck!”
“sir?”
“for
the
third
time
my
soul’s
ship
starts
upon
this
voyage
starbuck.”
“aye
sir
thou
wilt
have
it
so.”
“some
ships
sail
from
their
ports
and
ever
afterwards
are
missing
starbuck!”
“truth
sir
saddest
truth.”
“some
men
die
at
ebb
tide
some
at
low
water
some
at
the
full
of
the
flood;—and
i
feel
now
like
a
billow
that’s
all
one
crested
comb
starbuck
i
am
old;—shake
hands
with
me
man.”
their
hands
met
their
eyes
fastened
starbuck’s
tears
the
glue
“oh
my
captain
my
captain!—noble
heart—go
not—go
not!—see
it’s
a
brave
man
that
weeps
how
great
the
agony
of
the
persuasion
then!”
“lower
away!”—cried
ahab
tossing
the
mate’s
arm
from
him
“stand
by
the
crew!”
in
an
instant
the
boat
was
pulling
round
close
under
the
stern
“the
sharks
the
sharks!”
cried
a
voice
from
the
low
cabin-window
there
“o
master
my
master
come
back!”
but
ahab
heard
nothing
for
his
own
voice
was
high-lifted
then
and
the
boat
leaped
on
yet
the
voice
spake
true
for
scarce
had
he
pushed
from
the
ship
when
numbers
of
sharks
seemingly
rising
from
out
the
dark
waters
beneath
the
hull
maliciously
snapped
at
the
blades
of
the
oars
every
time
they
dipped
in
the
water
and
in
this
way
accompanied
the
boat
with
their
bites
it
is
a
thing
not
uncommonly
happening
to
the
whale-boats
in
those
swarming
seas
the
sharks
at
times
apparently
following
them
in
the
same
prescient
way
that
vultures
hover
over
the
banners
of
marching
regiments
in
the
east
but
these
were
the
first
sharks
that
had
been
observed
by
the
pequod
since
the
white
whale
had
been
first
descried
and
whether
it
was
that
ahab’s
crew
were
all
such
tiger-yellow
barbarians
and
therefore
their
flesh
more
musky
to
the
senses
of
the
sharks—a
matter
sometimes
well
known
to
affect
them,—however
it
was
they
seemed
to
follow
that
one
boat
without
molesting
the
others
“heart
of
wrought
steel!”
murmured
starbuck
gazing
over
the
side
and
following
with
his
eyes
the
receding
boat—“canst
thou
yet
ring
boldly
to
that
sight?—lowering
thy
keel
among
ravening
sharks
and
followed
by
them
open-mouthed
to
the
chase
and
this
the
critical
third
day?—for
when
three
days
flow
together
in
one
continuous
intense
pursuit
be
sure
the
first
is
the
morning
the
second
the
noon
and
the
third
the
evening
and
the
end
of
that
thing—be
that
end
what
it
may
oh
my
god
what
is
this
that
shoots
through
me
and
leaves
me
so
deadly
calm
yet
expectant,—fixed
at
the
top
of
a
shudder
future
things
swim
before
me
as
in
empty
outlines
and
skeletons
all
the
past
is
somehow
grown
dim
mary
girl
thou
fadest
in
pale
glories
behind
me
boy
i
seem
to
see
but
thy
eyes
grown
wondrous
blue
strangest
problems
of
life
seem
clearing
but
clouds
sweep
between—is
my
journey’s
end
coming
my
legs
feel
faint
like
his
who
has
footed
it
all
day
feel
thy
heart,—beats
it
yet
stir
thyself
starbuck!—stave
it
off—move
move
speak
aloud!—mast-head
there
see
ye
my
boy’s
hand
on
the
hill?—crazed;—aloft
there!—keep
thy
keenest
eye
upon
the
boats:—mark
well
the
whale!—ho
again!—drive
off
that
hawk
see
he
pecks—he
tears
the
vane”—pointing
to
the
red
flag
flying
at
the
main-truck—“ha
he
soars
away
with
it!—where’s
the
old
man
now
see’st
thou
that
sight
oh
ahab!—shudder
shudder!”
the
boats
had
not
gone
very
far
when
by
a
signal
from
the
mast-heads—a
downward
pointed
arm
ahab
knew
that
the
whale
had
sounded
but
intending
to
be
near
him
at
the
next
rising
he
held
on
his
way
a
little
sideways
from
the
vessel
the
becharmed
crew
maintaining
the
profoundest
silence
as
the
head-beat
waves
hammered
and
hammered
against
the
opposing
bow
“drive
drive
in
your
nails
oh
ye
waves
to
their
uttermost
heads
drive
them
in
ye
but
strike
a
thing
without
a
lid
and
no
coffin
and
no
hearse
can
be
mine:—and
hemp
only
can
kill
me
ha
ha!”
suddenly
the
waters
around
them
slowly
swelled
in
broad
circles
then
quickly
upheaved
as
if
sideways
sliding
from
a
submerged
berg
of
ice
swiftly
rising
to
the
surface
a
low
rumbling
sound
was
heard
a
subterraneous
hum
and
then
all
held
their
breaths
as
bedraggled
with
trailing
ropes
and
harpoons
and
lances
a
vast
form
shot
lengthwise
but
obliquely
from
the
sea
shrouded
in
a
thin
drooping
veil
of
mist
it
hovered
for
a
moment
in
the
rainbowed
air
and
then
fell
swamping
back
into
the
deep
crushed
thirty
feet
upwards
the
waters
flashed
for
an
instant
like
heaps
of
fountains
then
brokenly
sank
in
a
shower
of
flakes
leaving
the
circling
surface
creamed
like
new
milk
round
the
marble
trunk
of
the
whale
“give
way!”
cried
ahab
to
the
oarsmen
and
the
boats
darted
forward
to
the
attack
but
maddened
by
yesterday’s
fresh
irons
that
corroded
in
him
moby
dick
seemed
combinedly
possessed
by
all
the
angels
that
fell
from
heaven
the
wide
tiers
of
welded
tendons
overspreading
his
broad
white
forehead
beneath
the
transparent
skin
looked
knitted
together
as
head
on
he
came
churning
his
tail
among
the
boats
and
once
more
flailed
them
apart
spilling
out
the
irons
and
lances
from
the
two
mates’
boats
and
dashing
in
one
side
of
the
upper
part
of
their
bows
but
leaving
ahab’s
almost
without
a
scar
while
daggoo
and
queequeg
were
stopping
the
strained
planks
and
as
the
whale
swimming
out
from
them
turned
and
showed
one
entire
flank
as
he
shot
by
them
again
at
that
moment
a
quick
cry
went
up
lashed
round
and
round
to
the
fish’s
back
pinioned
in
the
turns
upon
turns
in
which
during
the
past
night
the
whale
had
reeled
the
involutions
of
the
lines
around
him
the
half
torn
body
of
the
parsee
was
seen
his
sable
raiment
frayed
to
shreds
his
distended
eyes
turned
full
upon
old
ahab
the
harpoon
dropped
from
his
hand
“befooled
befooled!”—drawing
in
a
long
lean
breath—“aye
parsee
i
see
thee
again.—aye
and
thou
goest
before
and
this
_this_
then
is
the
hearse
that
thou
didst
promise
but
i
hold
thee
to
the
last
letter
of
thy
word
where
is
the
second
hearse
away
mates
to
the
ship
those
boats
are
useless
now
repair
them
if
ye
can
in
time
and
return
to
me
if
not
ahab
is
enough
to
die—down
men
the
first
thing
that
but
offers
to
jump
from
this
boat
i
stand
in
that
thing
i
harpoon
ye
are
not
other
men
but
my
arms
and
my
legs
and
so
obey
me.—where’s
the
whale
gone
down
again?”
but
he
looked
too
nigh
the
boat
for
as
if
bent
upon
escaping
with
the
corpse
he
bore
and
as
if
the
particular
place
of
the
last
encounter
had
been
but
a
stage
in
his
leeward
voyage
moby
dick
was
now
again
steadily
swimming
forward
and
had
almost
passed
the
ship,—which
thus
far
had
been
sailing
in
the
contrary
direction
to
him
though
for
the
present
her
headway
had
been
stopped
he
seemed
swimming
with
his
utmost
velocity
and
now
only
intent
upon
pursuing
his
own
straight
path
in
the
sea
“oh
ahab,”
cried
starbuck
“not
too
late
is
it
even
now
the
third
day
to
desist
see
moby
dick
seeks
thee
not
it
is
thou
thou
that
madly
seekest
him!”
setting
sail
to
the
rising
wind
the
lonely
boat
was
swiftly
impelled
to
leeward
by
both
oars
and
canvas
and
at
last
when
ahab
was
sliding
by
the
vessel
so
near
as
plainly
to
distinguish
starbuck’s
face
as
he
leaned
over
the
rail
he
hailed
him
to
turn
the
vessel
about
and
follow
him
not
too
swiftly
at
a
judicious
interval
glancing
upwards
he
saw
tashtego
queequeg
and
daggoo
eagerly
mounting
to
the
three
mast-heads
while
the
oarsmen
were
rocking
in
the
two
staved
boats
which
had
but
just
been
hoisted
to
the
side
and
were
busily
at
work
in
repairing
them
one
after
the
other
through
the
port-holes
as
he
sped
he
also
caught
flying
glimpses
of
stubb
and
flask
busying
themselves
on
deck
among
bundles
of
new
irons
and
lances
as
he
saw
all
this
as
he
heard
the
hammers
in
the
broken
boats
far
other
hammers
seemed
driving
a
nail
into
his
heart
but
he
rallied
and
now
marking
that
the
vane
or
flag
was
gone
from
the
main-mast-head
he
shouted
to
tashtego
who
had
just
gained
that
perch
to
descend
again
for
another
flag
and
a
hammer
and
nails
and
so
nail
it
to
the
mast
whether
fagged
by
the
three
days’
running
chase
and
the
resistance
to
his
swimming
in
the
knotted
hamper
he
bore
or
whether
it
was
some
latent
deceitfulness
and
malice
in
him
whichever
was
true
the
white
whale’s
way
now
began
to
abate
as
it
seemed
from
the
boat
so
rapidly
nearing
him
once
more
though
indeed
the
whale’s
last
start
had
not
been
so
long
a
one
as
before
and
still
as
ahab
glided
over
the
waves
the
unpitying
sharks
accompanied
him
and
so
pertinaciously
stuck
to
the
boat
and
so
continually
bit
at
the
plying
oars
that
the
blades
became
jagged
and
crunched
and
left
small
splinters
in
the
sea
at
almost
every
dip
“heed
them
not
those
teeth
but
give
new
rowlocks
to
your
oars
pull
on
’tis
the
better
rest
the
shark’s
jaw
than
the
yielding
water.”
“but
at
every
bite
sir
the
thin
blades
grow
smaller
and
smaller!”
“they
will
last
long
enough
pull
on!—but
who
can
tell”—he
muttered—“whether
these
sharks
swim
to
feast
on
the
whale
or
on
ahab?—but
pull
on
aye
all
alive
now—we
near
him
the
helm
take
the
helm
let
me
pass,”—and
so
saying
two
of
the
oarsmen
helped
him
forward
to
the
bows
of
the
still
flying
boat
at
length
as
the
craft
was
cast
to
one
side
and
ran
ranging
along
with
the
white
whale’s
flank
he
seemed
strangely
oblivious
of
its
advance—as
the
whale
sometimes
will—and
ahab
was
fairly
within
the
smoky
mountain
mist
which
thrown
off
from
the
whale’s
spout
curled
round
his
great
monadnock
hump
he
was
even
thus
close
to
him
when
with
body
arched
back
and
both
arms
lengthwise
high-lifted
to
the
poise
he
darted
his
fierce
iron
and
his
far
fiercer
curse
into
the
hated
whale
as
both
steel
and
curse
sank
to
the
socket
as
if
sucked
into
a
morass
moby
dick
sideways
writhed
spasmodically
rolled
his
nigh
flank
against
the
bow
and
without
staving
a
hole
in
it
so
suddenly
canted
the
boat
over
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
elevated
part
of
the
gunwale
to
which
he
then
clung
ahab
would
once
more
have
been
tossed
into
the
sea
as
it
was
three
of
the
oarsmen—who
foreknew
not
the
precise
instant
of
the
dart
and
were
therefore
unprepared
for
its
effects—these
were
flung
out
but
so
fell
that
in
an
instant
two
of
them
clutched
the
gunwale
again
and
rising
to
its
level
on
a
combing
wave
hurled
themselves
bodily
inboard
again
the
third
man
helplessly
dropping
astern
but
still
afloat
and
swimming
almost
simultaneously
with
a
mighty
volition
of
ungraduated
instantaneous
swiftness
the
white
whale
darted
through
the
weltering
sea
but
when
ahab
cried
out
to
the
steersman
to
take
new
turns
with
the
line
and
hold
it
so
and
commanded
the
crew
to
turn
round
on
their
seats
and
tow
the
boat
up
to
the
mark
the
moment
the
treacherous
line
felt
that
double
strain
and
tug
it
snapped
in
the
empty
air
“what
breaks
in
me
some
sinew
cracks!—’tis
whole
again
oars
oars
burst
in
upon
him!”
hearing
the
tremendous
rush
of
the
sea-crashing
boat
the
whale
wheeled
round
to
present
his
blank
forehead
at
bay
but
in
that
evolution
catching
sight
of
the
nearing
black
hull
of
the
ship
seemingly
seeing
in
it
the
source
of
all
his
persecutions
bethinking
it—it
may
be—a
larger
and
nobler
foe
of
a
sudden
he
bore
down
upon
its
advancing
prow
smiting
his
jaws
amid
fiery
showers
of
foam
ahab
staggered
his
hand
smote
his
forehead
“i
grow
blind
hands
stretch
out
before
me
that
i
may
yet
grope
my
way
is’t
night?”
“the
whale
the
ship!”
cried
the
cringing
oarsmen
“oars
oars
slope
downwards
to
thy
depths
o
sea
that
ere
it
be
for
ever
too
late
ahab
may
slide
this
last
last
time
upon
his
mark
i
see
the
ship
the
ship
dash
on
my
men
will
ye
not
save
my
ship?”
but
as
the
oarsmen
violently
forced
their
boat
through
the
sledge-hammering
seas
the
before
whale-smitten
bow-ends
of
two
planks
burst
through
and
in
an
instant
almost
the
temporarily
disabled
boat
lay
nearly
level
with
the
waves
its
half-wading
splashing
crew
trying
hard
to
stop
the
gap
and
bale
out
the
pouring
water
meantime
for
that
one
beholding
instant
tashtego’s
mast-head
hammer
remained
suspended
in
his
hand
and
the
red
flag
half-wrapping
him
as
with
a
plaid
then
streamed
itself
straight
out
from
him
as
his
own
forward-flowing
heart
while
starbuck
and
stubb
standing
upon
the
bowsprit
beneath
caught
sight
of
the
down-coming
monster
just
as
soon
as
he
“the
whale
the
whale
up

up

oh
all
ye
sweet
powers
of

now
hug
me
close

turns
to

oh
his
unappeasable
brow
drives
on
towards

whose

“stand

to

off

most
mouldy
and

salted
death

“cherries

drawn
my

from
the
ship’s
bows
nearly
all
the
seamen
now
hung
inactive
hammers
bits
of
plank
lances
and
harpoons
mechanically
retained
in
their
hands
just
as
they
had
darted
from
their
various
employments
all
their
enchanted
eyes
intent
upon
the
whale
which
from
side
to
side
strangely
vibrating
his
predestinating
head
sent
a
broad
band
of
overspreading
semicircular
foam
before
him
as
he
rushed
retribution
swift
vengeance
eternal
malice
were
in
his
whole
aspect
and
spite
of
all
that
mortal
man
could
do
the
solid
white
buttress
of
his
forehead
smote
the
ship’s
starboard
bow
till
men
and
timbers
reeled
some
fell
flat
upon
their
faces
like
dislodged
trucks
the
heads
of
the
harpooneers
aloft
shook
on
their
bull-like
necks
through
the
breach
they
heard
the
waters
pour
as
mountain
torrents
down
a
flume
“the
ship
the
hearse!—the
second
hearse!”
cried
ahab
from
the
boat
“its
wood
could
only
be
american!”
diving
beneath
the
settling
ship
the
whale
ran
quivering
along
its
keel
but
turning
under
water
swiftly
shot
to
the
surface
again
far
off
the
other
bow
but
within
a
few
yards
of
ahab’s
boat
where
for
a
time
he
lay
quiescent
“i
turn
my
body
from
the
sun
what
ho
tashtego
let
me
hear
thy
hammer
oh
ye
three
unsurrendered
spires
of
mine
thou
uncracked
keel
and
only
god-bullied
hull
thou
firm
deck
and
haughty
helm
and
pole-pointed
prow,—death-glorious
ship
must
ye
then
perish
and
without
me
am
i
cut
off
from
the
last
fond
pride
of
meanest
shipwrecked
captains
oh
lonely
death
on
lonely
life
oh
now
i
feel
my
topmost
greatness
lies
in
my
topmost
grief
ho
ho
from
all
your
furthest
bounds
pour
ye
now
in
ye
bold
billows
of
my
whole
foregone
life
and
top
this
one
piled
comber
of
my
death
towards
thee
i
roll
thou
all-destroying
but
unconquering
whale
to
the
last
i
grapple
with
thee
from
hell’s
heart
i
stab
at
thee
for
hate’s
sake
i
spit
my
last
breath
at
thee
sink
all
coffins
and
all
hearses
to
one
common
pool
and
since
neither
can
be
mine
let
me
then
tow
to
pieces
while
still
chasing
thee
though
tied
to
thee
thou
damned
whale
_thus_
i
give
up
the
spear!”
the
harpoon
was
darted
the
stricken
whale
flew
forward
with
igniting
velocity
the
line
ran
through
the
grooves;—ran
foul
ahab
stooped
to
clear
it
he
did
clear
it
but
the
flying
turn
caught
him
round
the
neck
and
voicelessly
as
turkish
mutes
bowstring
their
victim
he
was
shot
out
of
the
boat
ere
the
crew
knew
he
was
gone
next
instant
the
heavy
eye-splice
in
the
rope’s
final
end
flew
out
of
the
stark-empty
tub
knocked
down
an
oarsman
and
smiting
the
sea
disappeared
in
its
depths
for
an
instant
the
tranced
boat’s
crew
stood
still
then
turned
“the
ship
great
god
where
is
the
ship?”
soon
they
through
dim
bewildering
mediums
saw
her
sidelong
fading
phantom
as
in
the
gaseous
fata
morgana
only
the
uppermost
masts
out
of
water
while
fixed
by
infatuation
or
fidelity
or
fate
to
their
once
lofty
perches
the
pagan
harpooneers
still
maintained
their
sinking
lookouts
on
the
sea
and
now
concentric
circles
seized
the
lone
boat
itself
and
all
its
crew
and
each
floating
oar
and
every
lance-pole
and
spinning
animate
and
inanimate
all
round
and
round
in
one
vortex
carried
the
smallest
chip
of
the
pequod
out
of
sight
but
as
the
last
whelmings
intermixingly
poured
themselves
over
the
sunken
head
of
the
indian
at
the
mainmast
leaving
a
few
inches
of
the
erect
spar
yet
visible
together
with
long
streaming
yards
of
the
flag
which
calmly
undulated
with
ironical
coincidings
over
the
destroying
billows
they
almost
touched;—at
that
instant
a
red
arm
and
a
hammer
hovered
backwardly
uplifted
in
the
open
air
in
the
act
of
nailing
the
flag
faster
and
yet
faster
to
the
subsiding
spar
a
sky-hawk
that
tauntingly
had
followed
the
main-truck
downwards
from
its
natural
home
among
the
stars
pecking
at
the
flag
and
incommoding
tashtego
there
this
bird
now
chanced
to
intercept
its
broad
fluttering
wing
between
the
hammer
and
the
wood
and
simultaneously
feeling
that
etherial
thrill
the
submerged
savage
beneath
in
his
death-gasp
kept
his
hammer
frozen
there
and
so
the
bird
of
heaven
with
archangelic
shrieks
and
his
imperial
beak
thrust
upwards
and
his
whole
captive
form
folded
in
the
flag
of
ahab
went
down
with
his
ship
which
like
satan
would
not
sink
to
hell
till
she
had
dragged
a
living
part
of
heaven
along
with
her
and
helmeted
herself
with
it
now
small
fowls
flew
screaming
over
the
yet
yawning
gulf
a
sullen
white
surf
beat
against
its
steep
sides
then
all
collapsed
and
the
great
shroud
of
the
sea
rolled
on
as
it
rolled

thousand
years
ago

of

slowly
drawn
towards

reached

round

and

towards
the
button-like
black

at

of

gaining

owing
to

the

christmas
won't
be
christmas
without
any
presents
i
playing
pilgrims
christmas
won't
be
christmas
without
any
presents
grumbled
jo
lying
on
the
rug
it's
so
dreadful
to
be
poor
sighed
meg
looking
down
at
her
old
dress
i
don't
think
it's
fair
for
some
girls
to
have
plenty
of
pretty
things
and
other
girls
nothing
at
all
added
little
amy
with
an
injured
sniff
we've
got
father
and
mother
and
each
other
said
beth
contentedly
from
her
corner
the
four
young
faces
on
which
the
firelight
shone
brightened
at
the
cheerful
words
but
darkened
again
as
jo
said
sadly,--
we
haven't
got
father
and
shall
not
have
him
for
a
long
time
she
didn't
say
perhaps
never
but
each
silently
added
it
thinking
of
father
far
away
where
the
fighting
was
nobody
spoke
for
a
minute
then
meg
said
in
an
altered
tone,--
you
know
the
reason
mother
proposed
not
having
any
presents
this
christmas
was
because
it
is
going
to
be
a
hard
winter
for
every
one
and
she
thinks
we
ought
not
to
spend
money
for
pleasure
when
our
men
are
suffering
so
in
the
army
we
can't
do
much
but
we
can
make
our
little
sacrifices
and
ought
to
do
it
gladly
but
i
am
afraid
i
don't
and
meg
shook
her
head
as
she
thought
regretfully
of
all
the
pretty
things
she
wanted
but
i
don't
think
the
little
we
should
spend
would
do
any
good
we've
each
got
a
dollar
and
the
army
wouldn't
be
much
helped
by
our
giving
that
i
agree
not
to
expect
anything
from
mother
or
you
but
i
do
want
to
buy
undine
and
sintram
for
myself
i've
wanted
it
_so_
long
said
jo
who
was
a
bookworm
i
planned
to
spend
mine
in
new
music
said
beth
with
a
little
sigh
which
no
one
heard
but
the
hearth-brush
and
kettle-holder
i
shall
get
a
nice
box
of
faber's
drawing-pencils
i
really
need
them
said
amy
decidedly
mother
didn't
say
anything
about
our
money
and
she
won't
wish
us
to
give
up
everything
let's
each
buy
what
we
want
and
have
a
little
fun
i'm
sure
we
work
hard
enough
to
earn
it
cried
jo
examining
the
heels
of
her
shoes
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
i
know
_i_
do,--teaching
those
tiresome
children
nearly
all
day
when
i'm
longing
to
enjoy
myself
at
home
began
meg
in
the
complaining
tone
again
you
don't
have
half
such
a
hard
time
as
i
do
said
jo
how
would
you
like
to
be
shut
up
for
hours
with
a
nervous
fussy
old
lady
who
keeps
you
trotting
is
never
satisfied
and
worries
you
till
you're
ready
to
fly
out
of
the
window
or
cry
it's
naughty
to
fret
but
i
do
think
washing
dishes
and
keeping
things
tidy
is
the
worst
work
in
the
world
it
makes
me
cross
and
my
hands
get
so
stiff
i
can't
practise
well
at
all
and
beth
looked
at
her
rough
hands
with
a
sigh
that
any
one
could
hear
that
time
i
don't
believe
any
of
you
suffer
as
i
do
cried
amy
for
you
don't
have
to
go
to
school
with
impertinent
girls
who
plague
you
if
you
don't
know
your
lessons
and
laugh
at
your
dresses
and
label
your
father
if
he
isn't
rich
and
insult
you
when
your
nose
isn't
nice
if
you
mean
_libel_
i'd
say
so
and
not
talk
about
_labels_
as
if
papa
was
a
pickle-bottle
advised
jo
laughing
i
know
what
i
mean
and
you
needn't
be
_statirical_
about
it
it's
proper
to
use
good
words
and
improve
your
_vocabilary_
returned
amy
with
dignity
don't
peck
at
one
another
children
don't
you
wish
we
had
the
money
papa
lost
when
we
were
little
jo
dear
me
how
happy
and
good
we'd
be
if
we
had
no
worries
said
meg
who
could
remember
better
times
you
said
the
other
day
you
thought
we
were
a
deal
happier
than
the
king
children
for
they
were
fighting
and
fretting
all
the
time
in
spite
of
their
money
so
i
did
beth
well
i
think
we
are
for
though
we
do
have
to
work
we
make
fun
for
ourselves
and
are
a
pretty
jolly
set
as
jo
would
say
jo
does
use
such
slang
words
observed
amy
with
a
reproving
look
at
the
long
figure
stretched
on
the
rug
jo
immediately
sat
up
put
her
hands
in
her
pockets
and
began
to
whistle
don't
jo
it's
so
boyish
that's
why
i
do
it
i
detest
rude
unlady-like
girls
i
hate
affected
niminy-piminy
chits
'birds
in
their
little
nests
agree,'
sang
beth
the
peace-maker
with
such
a
funny
face
that
both
sharp
voices
softened
to
a
laugh
and
the
pecking
ended
for
that
time
really
girls
you
are
both
to
be
blamed
said
meg
beginning
to
lecture
in
her
elder-sisterly
fashion
you
are
old
enough
to
leave
off
boyish
tricks
and
to
behave
better
josephine
it
didn't
matter
so
much
when
you
were
a
little
girl
but
now
you
are
so
tall
and
turn
up
your
hair
you
should
remember
that
you
are
a
young
lady
i'm
not
and
if
turning
up
my
hair
makes
me
one
i'll
wear
it
in
two
tails
till
i'm
twenty
cried
jo
pulling
off
her
net
and
shaking
down
a
chestnut
mane
i
hate
to
think
i've
got
to
grow
up
and
be
miss
march
and
wear
long
gowns
and
look
as
prim
as
a
china-aster
it's
bad
enough
to
be
a
girl
anyway
when
i
like
boys'
games
and
work
and
manners
i
can't
get
over
my
disappointment
in
not
being
a
boy
and
it's
worse
than
ever
now
for
i'm
dying
to
go
and
fight
with
papa
and
i
can
only
stay
at
home
and
knit
like
a
poky
old
woman
and
jo
shook
the
blue
army-sock
till
the
needles
rattled
like
castanets
and
her
ball
bounded
across
the
room
poor
jo
it's
too
bad
but
it
can't
be
helped
so
you
must
try
to
be
contented
with
making
your
name
boyish
and
playing
brother
to
us
girls
said
beth
stroking
the
rough
head
at
her
knee
with
a
hand
that
all
the
dish-washing
and
dusting
in
the
world
could
not
make
ungentle
in
its
touch
as
for
you
amy
continued
meg
you
are
altogether
too
particular
and
prim
your
airs
are
funny
now
but
you'll
grow
up
an
affected
little
goose
if
you
don't
take
care
i
like
your
nice
manners
and
refined
ways
of
speaking
when
you
don't
try
to
be
elegant
but
your
absurd
words
are
as
bad
as
jo's
slang
if
jo
is
a
tom-boy
and
amy
a
goose
what
am
i
please
asked
beth
ready
to
share
the
lecture
you're
a
dear
and
nothing
else
answered
meg
warmly
and
no
one
contradicted
her
for
the
mouse
was
the
pet
of
the
family
as
young
readers
like
to
know
how
people
look
we
will
take
this
moment
to
give
them
a
little
sketch
of
the
four
sisters
who
sat
knitting
away
in
the
twilight
while
the
december
snow
fell
quietly
without
and
the
fire
crackled
cheerfully
within
it
was
a
comfortable
old
room
though
the
carpet
was
faded
and
the
furniture
very
plain
for
a
good
picture
or
two
hung
on
the
walls
books
filled
the
recesses
chrysanthemums
and
christmas
roses
bloomed
in
the
windows
and
a
pleasant
atmosphere
of
home-peace
pervaded
it
margaret
the
eldest
of
the
four
was
sixteen
and
very
pretty
being
plump
and
fair
with
large
eyes
plenty
of
soft
brown
hair
a
sweet
mouth
and
white
hands
of
which
she
was
rather
vain
fifteen-year-old
jo
was
very
tall
thin
and
brown
and
reminded
one
of
a
colt
for
she
never
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
with
her
long
limbs
which
were
very
much
in
her
way
she
had
a
decided
mouth
a
comical
nose
and
sharp
gray
eyes
which
appeared
to
see
everything
and
were
by
turns
fierce
funny
or
thoughtful
her
long
thick
hair
was
her
one
beauty
but
it
was
usually
bundled
into
a
net
to
be
out
of
her
way
round
shoulders
had
jo
big
hands
and
feet
a
fly-away
look
to
her
clothes
and
the
uncomfortable
appearance
of
a
girl
who
was
rapidly
shooting
up
into
a
woman
and
didn't
like
it
elizabeth--or
beth
as
every
one
called
her--was
a
rosy
smooth-haired
bright-eyed
girl
of
thirteen
with
a
shy
manner
a
timid
voice
and
a
peaceful
expression
which
was
seldom
disturbed
her
father
called
her
little
tranquillity
and
the
name
suited
her
excellently
for
she
seemed
to
live
in
a
happy
world
of
her
own
only
venturing
out
to
meet
the
few
whom
she
trusted
and
loved
amy
though
the
youngest
was
a
most
important
person,--in
her
own
opinion
at
least
a
regular
snow-maiden
with
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
curling
on
her
shoulders
pale
and
slender
and
always
carrying
herself
like
a
young
lady
mindful
of
her
manners
what
the
characters
of
the
four
sisters
were
we
will
leave
to
be
found
out
the
clock
struck
six
and
having
swept
up
the
hearth
beth
put
a
pair
of
slippers
down
to
warm
somehow
the
sight
of
the
old
shoes
had
a
good
effect
upon
the
girls
for
mother
was
coming
and
every
one
brightened
to
welcome
her
meg
stopped
lecturing
and
lighted
the
lamp
amy
got
out
of
the
easy-chair
without
being
asked
and
jo
forgot
how
tired
she
was
as
she
sat
up
to
hold
the
slippers
nearer
to
the
blaze
illustration
beth
put
a
pair
of
slippers
down
to
warm
they
are
quite
worn
out
marmee
must
have
a
new
pair
i
thought
i'd
get
her
some
with
my
dollar
said
beth
no
i
shall
cried
amy
i'm
the
oldest
began
meg
but
jo
cut
in
with
a
decided--
i'm
the
man
of
the
family
now
papa
is
away
and
_i_
shall
provide
the
slippers
for
he
told
me
to
take
special
care
of
mother
while
he
was
gone
i'll
tell
you
what
we'll
do
said
beth
let's
each
get
her
something
for
christmas
and
not
get
anything
for
ourselves
that's
like
you
dear
what
will
we
get
exclaimed
jo
every
one
thought
soberly
for
a
minute
then
meg
announced
as
if
the
idea
was
suggested
by
the
sight
of
her
own
pretty
hands
i
shall
give
her
a
nice
pair
of
gloves
army
shoes
best
to
be
had
cried
jo
some
handkerchiefs
all
hemmed
said
beth
i'll
get
a
little
bottle
of
cologne
she
likes
it
and
it
won't
cost
much
so
i'll
have
some
left
to
buy
my
pencils
added
amy
how
will
we
give
the
things
asked
meg
put
them
on
the
table
and
bring
her
in
and
see
her
open
the
bundles
don't
you
remember
how
we
used
to
do
on
our
birthdays
answered
jo
illustration
i
used
to
be
so
frightened
when
it
was
my
turn
to
sit
in
the
big
chair
i
used
to
be
_so_
frightened
when
it
was
my
turn
to
sit
in
the
big
chair
with
the
crown
on
and
see
you
all
come
marching
round
to
give
the
presents
with
a
kiss
i
liked
the
things
and
the
kisses
but
it
was
dreadful
to
have
you
sit
looking
at
me
while
i
opened
the
bundles
said
beth
who
was
toasting
her
face
and
the
bread
for
tea
at
the
same
time
let
marmee
think
we
are
getting
things
for
ourselves
and
then
surprise
her
we
must
go
shopping
to-morrow
afternoon
meg
there
is
so
much
to
do
about
the
play
for
christmas
night
said
jo
marching
up
and
down
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
her
nose
in
the
air
i
don't
mean
to
act
any
more
after
this
time
i'm
getting
too
old
for
such
things
observed
meg
who
was
as
much
a
child
as
ever
about
dressing-up
frolics
you
won't
stop
i
know
as
long
as
you
can
trail
round
in
a
white
gown
with
your
hair
down
and
wear
gold-paper
jewelry
you
are
the
best
actress
we've
got
and
there'll
be
an
end
of
everything
if
you
quit
the
boards
said
jo
we
ought
to
rehearse
to-night
come
here
amy
and
do
the
fainting
scene
for
you
are
as
stiff
as
a
poker
in
that
i
can't
help
it
i
never
saw
any
one
faint
and
i
don't
choose
to
make
myself
all
black
and
blue
tumbling
flat
as
you
do
if
i
can
go
down
easily
i'll
drop
if
i
can't
i
shall
fall
into
a
chair
and
be
graceful
i
don't
care
if
hugo
does
come
at
me
with
a
pistol
returned
amy
who
was
not
gifted
with
dramatic
power
but
was
chosen
because
she
was
small
enough
to
be
borne
out
shrieking
by
the
villain
of
the
piece
illustration
do
it
this
way
clasp
your
hands
so
do
it
this
way
clasp
your
hands
so
and
stagger
across
the
room
crying
frantically
'roderigo
save
me
save
me!'
and
away
went
jo
with
a
melodramatic
scream
which
was
truly
thrilling
amy
followed
but
she
poked
her
hands
out
stiffly
before
her
and
jerked
herself
along
as
if
she
went
by
machinery
and
her
ow
was
more
suggestive
of
pins
being
run
into
her
than
of
fear
and
anguish
jo
gave
a
despairing
groan
and
meg
laughed
outright
while
beth
let
her
bread
burn
as
she
watched
the
fun
with
interest
it's
no
use
do
the
best
you
can
when
the
time
comes
and
if
the
audience
laugh
don't
blame
me
come
on
meg
then
things
went
smoothly
for
don
pedro
defied
the
world
in
a
speech
of
two
pages
without
a
single
break
hagar
the
witch
chanted
an
awful
incantation
over
her
kettleful
of
simmering
toads
with
weird
effect
roderigo
rent
his
chains
asunder
manfully
and
hugo
died
in
agonies
of
remorse
and
arsenic
with
a
wild
ha
ha
it's
the
best
we've
had
yet
said
meg
as
the
dead
villain
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
elbows
i
don't
see
how
you
can
write
and
act
such
splendid
things
jo
you're
a
regular
shakespeare
exclaimed
beth
who
firmly
believed
that
her
sisters
were
gifted
with
wonderful
genius
in
all
things
not
quite
replied
jo
modestly
i
do
think
'the
witch's
curse
an
operatic
tragedy,'
is
rather
a
nice
thing
but
i'd
like
to
try
macbeth
if
we
only
had
a
trap-door
for
banquo
i
always
wanted
to
do
the
killing
part
'is
that
a
dagger
that
i
see
before
me?'
muttered
jo
rolling
her
eyes
and
clutching
at
the
air
as
she
had
seen
a
famous
tragedian
do
no
it's
the
toasting
fork
with
mother's
shoe
on
it
instead
of
the
bread
beth's
stage-struck
cried
meg
and
the
rehearsal
ended
in
a
general
burst
of
laughter
glad
to
find
you
so
merry
my
girls
said
a
cheery
voice
at
the
door
and
actors
and
audience
turned
to
welcome
a
tall
motherly
lady
with
a
can-i-help-you
look
about
her
which
was
truly
delightful
she
was
not
elegantly
dressed
but
a
noble-looking
woman
and
the
girls
thought
the
gray
cloak
and
unfashionable
bonnet
covered
the
most
splendid
mother
in
the
world
well
dearies
how
have
you
got
on
to-day
there
was
so
much
to
do
getting
the
boxes
ready
to
go
to-morrow
that
i
didn't
come
home
to
dinner
has
any
one
called
beth
how
is
your
cold
meg
jo
you
look
tired
to
death
come
and
kiss
me
baby
while
making
these
maternal
inquiries
mrs
march
got
her
wet
things
off
her
warm
slippers
on
and
sitting
down
in
the
easy-chair
drew
amy
to
her
lap
preparing
to
enjoy
the
happiest
hour
of
her
busy
day
the
girls
flew
about
trying
to
make
things
comfortable
each
in
her
own
way
meg
arranged
the
tea-table
jo
brought
wood
and
set
chairs
dropping
overturning
and
clattering
everything
she
touched
beth
trotted
to
and
fro
between
parlor
and
kitchen
quiet
and
busy
while
amy
gave
directions
to
every
one
as
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
as
they
gathered
about
the
table
mrs
march
said
with
a
particularly
happy
face
i've
got
a
treat
for
you
after
supper
a
quick
bright
smile
went
round
like
a
streak
of
sunshine
beth
clapped
her
hands
regardless
of
the
biscuit
she
held
and
jo
tossed
up
her
napkin
crying
a
letter
a
letter
three
cheers
for
father
yes
a
nice
long
letter
he
is
well
and
thinks
he
shall
get
through
the
cold
season
better
than
we
feared
he
sends
all
sorts
of
loving
wishes
for
christmas
and
an
especial
message
to
you
girls
said
mrs
march
patting
her
pocket
as
if
she
had
got
a
treasure
there
hurry
and
get
done
don't
stop
to
quirk
your
little
finger
and
simper
over
your
plate
amy
cried
jo
choking
in
her
tea
and
dropping
her
bread
butter
side
down
on
the
carpet
in
her
haste
to
get
at
the
treat
beth
ate
no
more
but
crept
away
to
sit
in
her
shadowy
corner
and
brood
over
the
delight
to
come
till
the
others
were
ready
i
think
it
was
so
splendid
in
father
to
go
as
a
chaplain
when
he
was
too
old
to
be
drafted
and
not
strong
enough
for
a
soldier
said
meg
warmly
don't
i
wish
i
could
go
as
a
drummer
a
_vivan_--what's
its
name
or
a
nurse
so
i
could
be
near
him
and
help
him
exclaimed
jo
with
a
groan
it
must
be
very
disagreeable
to
sleep
in
a
tent
and
eat
all
sorts
of
bad-tasting
things
and
drink
out
of
a
tin
mug
sighed
amy
when
will
he
come
home
marmee
asked
beth
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
voice
not
for
many
months
dear
unless
he
is
sick
he
will
stay
and
do
his
work
faithfully
as
long
as
he
can
and
we
won't
ask
for
him
back
a
minute
sooner
than
he
can
be
spared
now
come
and
hear
the
letter
they
all
drew
to
the
fire
mother
in
the
big
chair
with
beth
at
her
feet
meg
and
amy
perched
on
either
arm
of
the
chair
and
jo
leaning
on
the
back
where
no
one
would
see
any
sign
of
emotion
if
the
letter
should
happen
to
be
touching
very
few
letters
were
written
in
those
hard
times
that
were
not
touching
especially
those
which
fathers
sent
home
in
this
one
little
was
said
of
the
hardships
endured
the
dangers
faced
or
the
homesickness
conquered
it
was
a
cheerful
hopeful
letter
full
of
lively
descriptions
of
camp
life
marches
and
military
news
and
only
at
the
end
did
the
writer's
heart
overflow
with
fatherly
love
and
longing
for
the
little
girls
at
home
illustration
it
was
a
cheerful
hopeful
letter
give
them
all
my
dear
love
and
a
kiss
tell
them
i
think
of
them
by
day
pray
for
them
by
night
and
find
my
best
comfort
in
their
affection
at
all
times
a
year
seems
very
long
to
wait
before
i
see
them
but
remind
them
that
while
we
wait
we
may
all
work
so
that
these
hard
days
need
not
be
wasted
i
know
they
will
remember
all
i
said
to
them
that
they
will
be
loving
children
to
you
will
do
their
duty
faithfully
fight
their
bosom
enemies
bravely
and
conquer
themselves
so
beautifully
that
when
i
come
back
to
them
i
may
be
fonder
and
prouder
than
ever
of
my
little
women
everybody
sniffed
when
they
came
to
that
part
jo
wasn't
ashamed
of
the
great
tear
that
dropped
off
the
end
of
her
nose
and
amy
never
minded
the
rumpling
of
her
curls
as
she
hid
her
face
on
her
mother's
shoulder
and
sobbed
out
i
_am_
a
selfish
girl
but
i'll
truly
try
to
be
better
so
he
mayn't
be
disappointed
in
me
by
and
by
we
all
will
cried
meg
i
think
too
much
of
my
looks
and
hate
to
work
but
won't
any
more
if
i
can
help
it
i'll
try
and
be
what
he
loves
to
call
me
'a
little
woman,'
and
not
be
rough
and
wild
but
do
my
duty
here
instead
of
wanting
to
be
somewhere
else
said
jo
thinking
that
keeping
her
temper
at
home
was
a
much
harder
task
than
facing
a
rebel
or
two
down
south
beth
said
nothing
but
wiped
away
her
tears
with
the
blue
army-sock
and
began
to
knit
with
all
her
might
losing
no
time
in
doing
the
duty
that
lay
nearest
her
while
she
resolved
in
her
quiet
little
soul
to
be
all
that
father
hoped
to
find
her
when
the
year
brought
round
the
happy
coming
home
illustration
how
you
used
to
play
pilgrim's
progress
mrs
march
broke
the
silence
that
followed
jo's
words
by
saying
in
her
cheery
voice
do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
play
pilgrim's
progress
when
you
were
little
things
nothing
delighted
you
more
than
to
have
me
tie
my
piece-bags
on
your
backs
for
burdens
give
you
hats
and
sticks
and
rolls
of
paper
and
let
you
travel
through
the
house
from
the
cellar
which
was
the
city
of
destruction
up
up
to
the
house-top
where
you
had
all
the
lovely
things
you
could
collect
to
make
a
celestial
city
what
fun
it
was
especially
going
by
the
lions
fighting
apollyon
and
passing
through
the
valley
where
the
hobgoblins
were
said
jo
i
liked
the
place
where
the
bundles
fell
off
and
tumbled
down
stairs
said
meg
my
favorite
part
was
when
we
came
out
on
the
flat
roof
where
our
flowers
and
arbors
and
pretty
things
were
and
all
stood
and
sung
for
joy
up
there
in
the
sunshine
said
beth
smiling
as
if
that
pleasant
moment
had
come
back
to
her
i
don't
remember
much
about
it
except
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
cellar
and
the
dark
entry
and
always
liked
the
cake
and
milk
we
had
up
at
the
top
if
i
wasn't
too
old
for
such
things
i'd
rather
like
to
play
it
over
again
said
amy
who
began
to
talk
of
renouncing
childish
things
at
the
mature
age
of
twelve
we
never
are
too
old
for
this
my
dear
because
it
is
a
play
we
are
playing
all
the
time
in
one
way
or
another
our
burdens
are
here
our
road
is
before
us
and
the
longing
for
goodness
and
happiness
is
the
guide
that
leads
us
through
many
troubles
and
mistakes
to
the
peace
which
is
a
true
celestial
city
now
my
little
pilgrims
suppose
you
begin
again
not
in
play
but
in
earnest
and
see
how
far
on
you
can
get
before
father
comes
home
really
mother
where
are
our
bundles
asked
amy
who
was
a
very
literal
young
lady
each
of
you
told
what
your
burden
was
just
now
except
beth
i
rather
think
she
hasn't
got
any
said
her
mother
yes
i
have
mine
is
dishes
and
dusters
and
envying
girls
with
nice
pianos
and
being
afraid
of
people
beth's
bundle
was
such
a
funny
one
that
everybody
wanted
to
laugh
but
nobody
did
for
it
would
have
hurt
her
feelings
very
much
let
us
do
it
said
meg
thoughtfully
it
is
only
another
name
for
trying
to
be
good
and
the
story
may
help
us
for
though
we
do
want
to
be
good
it's
hard
work
and
we
forget
and
don't
do
our
best
we
were
in
the
slough
of
despond
to-night
and
mother
came
and
pulled
us
out
as
help
did
in
the
book
we
ought
to
have
our
roll
of
directions
like
christian
what
shall
we
do
about
that
asked
jo
delighted
with
the
fancy
which
lent
a
little
romance
to
the
very
dull
task
of
doing
her
duty
look
under
your
pillows
christmas
morning
and
you
will
find
your
guide-book
replied
mrs
march
they
talked
over
the
new
plan
while
old
hannah
cleared
the
table
then
out
came
the
four
little
work-baskets
and
the
needles
flew
as
the
girls
made
sheets
for
aunt
march
it
was
uninteresting
sewing
but
to-night
no
one
grumbled
they
adopted
jo's
plan
of
dividing
the
long
seams
into
four
parts
and
calling
the
quarters
europe
asia
africa
and
america
and
in
that
way
got
on
capitally
especially
when
they
talked
about
the
different
countries
as
they
stitched
their
way
through
them
illustration
no
one
but
beth
could
get
much
music
out
of
the
old
piano
at
nine
they
stopped
work
and
sung
as
usual
before
they
went
to
bed
no
one
but
beth
could
get
much
music
out
of
the
old
piano
but
she
had
a
way
of
softly
touching
the
yellow
keys
and
making
a
pleasant
accompaniment
to
the
simple
songs
they
sung
meg
had
a
voice
like
a
flute
and
she
and
her
mother
led
the
little
choir
amy
chirped
like
a
cricket
and
jo
wandered
through
the
airs
at
her
own
sweet
will
always
coming
out
at
the
wrong
place
with
a
croak
or
a
quaver
that
spoilt
the
most
pensive
tune
they
had
always
done
this
from
the
time
they
could
lisp
crinkle
crinkle
'ittle
'tar
and
it
had
become
a
household
custom
for
the
mother
was
a
born
singer
the
first
sound
in
the
morning
was
her
voice
as
she
went
about
the
house
singing
like
a
lark
and
the
last
sound
at
night
was
the
same
cheery
sound
for
the
girls
never
grew
too
old
for
that
familiar
lullaby
illustration
at
nine
they
stopped
work
and
sung
as
usual
illustration
a
merry
christmas
ii
a
merry
christmas
jo
was
the
first
to
wake
in
the
gray
dawn
of
christmas
morning
no
stockings
hung
at
the
fireplace
and
for
a
moment
she
felt
as
much
disappointed
as
she
did
long
ago
when
her
little
sock
fell
down
because
it
was
so
crammed
with
goodies
then
she
remembered
her
mother's
promise
and
slipping
her
hand
under
her
pillow
drew
out
a
little
crimson-covered
book
she
knew
it
very
well
for
it
was
that
beautiful
old
story
of
the
best
life
ever
lived
and
jo
felt
that
it
was
a
true
guide-book
for
any
pilgrim
going
the
long
journey
she
woke
meg
with
a
merry
christmas
and
bade
her
see
what
was
under
her
pillow
a
green-covered
book
appeared
with
the
same
picture
inside
and
a
few
words
written
by
their
mother
which
made
their
one
present
very
precious
in
their
eyes
presently
beth
and
amy
woke
to
rummage
and
find
their
little
books
also,--one
dove-colored
the
other
blue
and
all
sat
looking
at
and
talking
about
them
while
the
east
grew
rosy
with
the
coming
day
in
spite
of
her
small
vanities
margaret
had
a
sweet
and
pious
nature
which
unconsciously
influenced
her
sisters
especially
jo
who
loved
her
very
tenderly
and
obeyed
her
because
her
advice
was
so
gently
given
girls
said
meg
seriously
looking
from
the
tumbled
head
beside
her
to
the
two
little
night-capped
ones
in
the
room
beyond
mother
wants
us
to
read
and
love
and
mind
these
books
and
we
must
begin
at
once
we
used
to
be
faithful
about
it
but
since
father
went
away
and
all
this
war
trouble
unsettled
us
we
have
neglected
many
things
you
can
do
as
you
please
but
_i_
shall
keep
my
book
on
the
table
here
and
read
a
little
every
morning
as
soon
as
i
wake
for
i
know
it
will
do
me
good
and
help
me
through
the
day
then
she
opened
her
new
book
and
began
to
read
jo
put
her
arm
round
her
and
leaning
cheek
to
cheek
read
also
with
the
quiet
expression
so
seldom
seen
on
her
restless
face
how
good
meg
is
come
amy
let's
do
as
they
do
i'll
help
you
with
the
hard
words
and
they'll
explain
things
if
we
don't
understand
whispered
beth
very
much
impressed
by
the
pretty
books
and
her
sisters'
example
i'm
glad
mine
is
blue
said
amy
and
then
the
rooms
were
very
still
while
the
pages
were
softly
turned
and
the
winter
sunshine
crept
in
to
touch
the
bright
heads
and
serious
faces
with
a
christmas
greeting
where
is
mother
asked
meg
as
she
and
jo
ran
down
to
thank
her
for
their
gifts
half
an
hour
later
goodness
only
knows
some
poor
creeter
come
a-beggin'
and
your
ma
went
straight
off
to
see
what
was
needed
there
never
_was_
such
a
woman
for
givin'
away
vittles
and
drink
clothes
and
firin'
replied
hannah
who
had
lived
with
the
family
since
meg
was
born
and
was
considered
by
them
all
more
as
a
friend
than
a
servant
she
will
be
back
soon
i
think
so
fry
your
cakes
and
have
everything
ready
said
meg
looking
over
the
presents
which
were
collected
in
a
basket
and
kept
under
the
sofa
ready
to
be
produced
at
the
proper
time
why
where
is
amy's
bottle
of
cologne
she
added
as
the
little
flask
did
not
appear
she
took
it
out
a
minute
ago
and
went
off
with
it
to
put
a
ribbon
on
it
or
some
such
notion
replied
jo
dancing
about
the
room
to
take
the
first
stiffness
off
the
new
army-slippers
how
nice
my
handkerchiefs
look
don't
they
hannah
washed
and
ironed
them
for
me
and
i
marked
them
all
myself
said
beth
looking
proudly
at
the
somewhat
uneven
letters
which
had
cost
her
such
labor
bless
the
child
she's
gone
and
put
'mother'
on
them
instead
of
'm
march.'
how
funny
cried
jo
taking
up
one
isn't
it
right
i
thought
it
was
better
to
do
it
so
because
meg's
initials
are
'm
m.,'
and
i
don't
want
any
one
to
use
these
but
marmee
said
beth
looking
troubled
it's
all
right
dear
and
a
very
pretty
idea,--quite
sensible
too
for
no
one
can
ever
mistake
now
it
will
please
her
very
much
i
know
said
meg
with
a
frown
for
jo
and
a
smile
for
beth
there's
mother
hide
the
basket
quick
cried
jo
as
a
door
slammed
and
steps
sounded
in
the
hall
amy
came
in
hastily
and
looked
rather
abashed
when
she
saw
her
sisters
all
waiting
for
her
where
have
you
been
and
what
are
you
hiding
behind
you
asked
meg
surprised
to
see
by
her
hood
and
cloak
that
lazy
amy
had
been
out
so
early
don't
laugh
at
me
jo
i
didn't
mean
any
one
should
know
till
the
time
came
i
only
meant
to
change
the
little
bottle
for
a
big
one
and
i
gave
_all_
my
money
to
get
it
and
i'm
truly
trying
not
to
be
selfish
any
more
as
she
spoke
amy
showed
the
handsome
flask
which
replaced
the
cheap
one
and
looked
so
earnest
and
humble
in
her
little
effort
to
forget
herself
that
meg
hugged
her
on
the
spot
and
jo
pronounced
her
a
trump
while
beth
ran
to
the
window
and
picked
her
finest
rose
to
ornament
the
stately
bottle
you
see
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
present
after
reading
and
talking
about
being
good
this
morning
so
i
ran
round
the
corner
and
changed
it
the
minute
i
was
up
and
i'm
_so_
glad
for
mine
is
the
handsomest
now
another
bang
of
the
street-door
sent
the
basket
under
the
sofa
and
the
girls
to
the
table
eager
for
breakfast
merry
christmas
marmee
many
of
them
thank
you
for
our
books
we
read
some
and
mean
to
every
day
they
cried
in
chorus
merry
christmas
little
daughters
i'm
glad
you
began
at
once
and
hope
you
will
keep
on
but
i
want
to
say
one
word
before
we
sit
down
not
far
away
from
here
lies
a
poor
woman
with
a
little
new-born
baby
six
children
are
huddled
into
one
bed
to
keep
from
freezing
for
they
have
no
fire
there
is
nothing
to
eat
over
there
and
the
oldest
boy
came
to
tell
me
they
were
suffering
hunger
and
cold
my
girls
will
you
give
them
your
breakfast
as
a
christmas
present
they
were
all
unusually
hungry
having
waited
nearly
an
hour
and
for
a
minute
no
one
spoke
only
a
minute
for
jo
exclaimed
impetuously,--
i'm
so
glad
you
came
before
we
began
may
i
go
and
help
carry
the
things
to
the
poor
little
children
asked
beth
eagerly
_i_
shall
take
the
cream
and
the
muffins
added
amy
heroically
giving
up
the
articles
she
most
liked
meg
was
already
covering
the
buckwheats
and
piling
the
bread
into
one
big
plate
i
thought
you'd
do
it
said
mrs
march
smiling
as
if
satisfied
you
shall
all
go
and
help
me
and
when
we
come
back
we
will
have
bread
and
milk
for
breakfast
and
make
it
up
at
dinner-time
they
were
soon
ready
and
the
procession
set
out
fortunately
it
was
early
and
they
went
through
back
streets
so
few
people
saw
them
and
no
one
laughed
at
the
queer
party
illustration
the
procession
set
out
a
poor
bare
miserable
room
it
was
with
broken
windows
no
fire
ragged
bed-clothes
a
sick
mother
wailing
baby
and
a
group
of
pale
hungry
children
cuddled
under
one
old
quilt
trying
to
keep
warm
how
the
big
eyes
stared
and
the
blue
lips
smiled
as
the
girls
went
in
ach
mein
gott
it
is
good
angels
come
to
us
said
the
poor
woman
crying
for
joy
funny
angels
in
hoods
and
mittens
said
jo
and
set
them
laughing
in
a
few
minutes
it
really
did
seem
as
if
kind
spirits
had
been
at
work
there
hannah
who
had
carried
wood
made
a
fire
and
stopped
up
the
broken
panes
with
old
hats
and
her
own
cloak
mrs
march
gave
the
mother
tea
and
gruel
and
comforted
her
with
promises
of
help
while
she
dressed
the
little
baby
as
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
her
own
the
girls
meantime
spread
the
table
set
the
children
round
the
fire
and
fed
them
like
so
many
hungry
birds,--laughing
talking
and
trying
to
understand
the
funny
broken
english
das
ist
gut
die
engel-kinder
cried
the
poor
things
as
they
ate
and
warmed
their
purple
hands
at
the
comfortable
blaze
the
girls
had
never
been
called
angel
children
before
and
thought
it
very
agreeable
especially
jo
who
had
been
considered
a
sancho
ever
since
she
was
born
that
was
a
very
happy
breakfast
though
they
didn't
get
any
of
it
and
when
they
went
away
leaving
comfort
behind
i
think
there
were
not
in
all
the
city
four
merrier
people
than
the
hungry
little
girls
who
gave
away
their
breakfasts
and
contented
themselves
with
bread
and
milk
on
christmas
morning
that's
loving
our
neighbor
better
than
ourselves
and
i
like
it
said
meg
as
they
set
out
their
presents
while
their
mother
was
upstairs
collecting
clothes
for
the
poor
hummels
not
a
very
splendid
show
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
love
done
up
in
the
few
little
bundles
and
the
tall
vase
of
red
roses
white
chrysanthemums
and
trailing
vines
which
stood
in
the
middle
gave
quite
an
elegant
air
to
the
table
she's
coming
strike
up
beth
open
the
door
amy
three
cheers
for
marmee
cried
jo
prancing
about
while
meg
went
to
conduct
mother
to
the
seat
of
honor
beth
played
her
gayest
march
amy
threw
open
the
door
and
meg
enacted
escort
with
great
dignity
mrs
march
was
both
surprised
and
touched
and
smiled
with
her
eyes
full
as
she
examined
her
presents
and
read
the
little
notes
which
accompanied
them
the
slippers
went
on
at
once
a
new
handkerchief
was
slipped
into
her
pocket
well
scented
with
amy's
cologne
the
rose
was
fastened
in
her
bosom
and
the
nice
gloves
were
pronounced
a
perfect
fit
there
was
a
good
deal
of
laughing
and
kissing
and
explaining
in
the
simple
loving
fashion
which
makes
these
home-festivals
so
pleasant
at
the
time
so
sweet
to
remember
long
afterward
and
then
all
fell
to
work
the
morning
charities
and
ceremonies
took
so
much
time
that
the
rest
of
the
day
was
devoted
to
preparations
for
the
evening
festivities
being
still
too
young
to
go
often
to
the
theatre
and
not
rich
enough
to
afford
any
great
outlay
for
private
performances
the
girls
put
their
wits
to
work
and--necessity
being
the
mother
of
invention,--made
whatever
they
needed
very
clever
were
some
of
their
productions,--pasteboard
guitars
antique
lamps
made
of
old-fashioned
butter-boats
covered
with
silver
paper
gorgeous
robes
of
old
cotton
glittering
with
tin
spangles
from
a
pickle
factory
and
armor
covered
with
the
same
useful
diamond-shaped
bits
left
in
sheets
when
the
lids
of
tin
preserve-pots
were
cut
out
the
furniture
was
used
to
being
turned
topsy-turvy
and
the
big
chamber
was
the
scene
of
many
innocent
revels
no
gentlemen
were
admitted
so
jo
played
male
parts
to
her
heart's
content
and
took
immense
satisfaction
in
a
pair
of
russet-leather
boots
given
her
by
a
friend
who
knew
a
lady
who
knew
an
actor
these
boots
an
old
foil
and
a
slashed
doublet
once
used
by
an
artist
for
some
picture
were
jo's
chief
treasures
and
appeared
on
all
occasions
the
smallness
of
the
company
made
it
necessary
for
the
two
principal
actors
to
take
several
parts
apiece
and
they
certainly
deserved
some
credit
for
the
hard
work
they
did
in
learning
three
or
four
different
parts
whisking
in
and
out
of
various
costumes
and
managing
the
stage
besides
it
was
excellent
drill
for
their
memories
a
harmless
amusement
and
employed
many
hours
which
otherwise
would
have
been
idle
lonely
or
spent
in
less
profitable
society
on
christmas
night
a
dozen
girls
piled
on
to
the
bed
which
was
the
dress-circle
and
sat
before
the
blue
and
yellow
chintz
curtains
in
a
most
flattering
state
of
expectancy
there
was
a
good
deal
of
rustling
and
whispering
behind
the
curtain
a
trifle
of
lamp-smoke
and
an
occasional
giggle
from
amy
who
was
apt
to
get
hysterical
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
presently
a
bell
sounded
the
curtains
flew
apart
and
the
operatic
tragedy
began
a
gloomy
wood
according
to
the
one
play-bill
was
represented
by
a
few
shrubs
in
pots
green
baize
on
the
floor
and
a
cave
in
the
distance
this
cave
was
made
with
a
clothes-horse
for
a
roof
bureaus
for
walls
and
in
it
was
a
small
furnace
in
full
blast
with
a
black
pot
on
it
and
an
old
witch
bending
over
it
the
stage
was
dark
and
the
glow
of
the
furnace
had
a
fine
effect
especially
as
real
steam
issued
from
the
kettle
when
the
witch
took
off
the
cover
a
moment
was
allowed
for
the
first
thrill
to
subside
then
hugo
the
villain
stalked
in
with
a
clanking
sword
at
his
side
a
slouched
hat
black
beard
mysterious
cloak
and
the
boots
after
pacing
to
and
fro
in
much
agitation
he
struck
his
forehead
and
burst
out
in
a
wild
strain
singing
of
his
hatred
to
roderigo
his
love
for
zara
and
his
pleasing
resolution
to
kill
the
one
and
win
the
other
the
gruff
tones
of
hugo's
voice
with
an
occasional
shout
when
his
feelings
overcame
him
were
very
impressive
and
the
audience
applauded
the
moment
he
paused
for
breath
bowing
with
the
air
of
one
accustomed
to
public
praise
he
stole
to
the
cavern
and
ordered
hagar
to
come
forth
with
a
commanding
what
ho
minion
i
need
thee
illustration
out
came
meg
with

out
came
meg
with
gray
horse-hair
hanging
about
her
face
a
red
and
black
robe
a
staff
and
cabalistic
signs
upon
her
cloak
hugo
demanded
a
potion
to
make
zara
adore
him
and
one
to
destroy
roderigo
hagar
in
a
fine
dramatic
melody
promised
both
and
proceeded
to
call
up
the
spirit
who
would
bring
the
love
philter:--
hither
hither
from
thy
home
airy
sprite
i
bid
thee
come
born
of
roses
fed
on
dew
charms
and
potions
canst
thou
brew
bring
me
here
with
elfin
speed
the
fragrant
philter
which
i
need
make
it
sweet
and
swift
and
strong
spirit
answer
now
my
song
illustration
a
little
figure
in
cloudy
white
a
soft
strain
of
music
sounded
and
then
at
the
back
of
the
cave
appeared
a
little
figure
in
cloudy
white
with
glittering
wings
golden
hair
and
a
garland
of
roses
on
its
head
waving
a
wand
it
sang,--
hither
i
come
from
my
airy
home
afar
in
the
silver
moon
take
the
magic
spell
and
use
it
well
or
its
power
will
vanish
soon
and
dropping
a
small
gilded
bottle
at
the
witch's
feet
the
spirit
vanished
another
chant
from
hagar
produced
another
apparition,--not
a
lovely
one
for
with
a
bang
an
ugly
black
imp
appeared
and
having
croaked
a
reply
tossed
a
dark
bottle
at
hugo
and
disappeared
with
a
mocking
laugh
having
warbled
his
thanks
and
put
the
potions
in
his
boots
hugo
departed
and
hagar
informed
the
audience
that
as
he
had
killed
a
few
of
her
friends
in
times
past
she
has
cursed
him
and
intends
to
thwart
his
plans
and
be
revenged
on
him
then
the
curtain
fell
and
the
audience
reposed
and
ate
candy
while
discussing
the
merits
of
the
play
a
good
deal
of
hammering
went
on
before
the
curtain
rose
again
but
when
it
became
evident
what
a
masterpiece
of
stage-carpentering
had
been
got
up
no
one
murmured
at
the
delay
it
was
truly
superb
a
tower
rose
to
the
ceiling
half-way
up
appeared
a
window
with
a
lamp
burning
at
it
and
behind
the
white
curtain
appeared
zara
in
a
lovely
blue
and
silver
dress
waiting
for
roderigo
he
came
in
gorgeous
array
with
plumed
cap
red
cloak
chestnut
love-locks
a
guitar
and
the
boots
of
course
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
he
sang
a
serenade
in
melting
tones
zara
replied
and
after
a
musical
dialogue
consented
to
fly
then
came
the
grand
effect
of
the
play
roderigo
produced
a
rope-ladder
with
five
steps
to
it
threw
up
one
end
and
invited
zara
to
descend
timidly
she
crept
from
her
lattice
put
her
hand
on
roderigo's
shoulder
and
was
about
to
leap
gracefully
down
when
alas
alas
for
zara
she
forgot
her
train,--it
caught
in
the
window
the
tower
tottered
leaned
forward
fell
with
a
crash
and
buried
the
unhappy
lovers
in
the
ruins
a
universal
shriek
arose
as
the
russet
boots
waved
wildly
from
the
wreck
and
a
golden
head
emerged
exclaiming
i
told
you
so
i
told
you
so
with
wonderful
presence
of
mind
don
pedro
the
cruel
sire
rushed
in
dragged
out
his
daughter
with
a
hasty
aside,--
don't
laugh
act
as
if
it
was
all
right!"--and
ordering
roderigo
up
banished
him
from
the
kingdom
with
wrath
and
scorn
though
decidedly
shaken
by
the
fall
of
the
tower
upon
him
roderigo
defied
the
old
gentleman
and
refused
to
stir
this
dauntless
example
fired
zara
she
also
defied
her
sire
and
he
ordered
them
both
to
the
deepest
dungeons
of
the
castle
a
stout
little
retainer
came
in
with
chains
and
led
them
away
looking
very
much
frightened
and
evidently
forgetting
the
speech
he
ought
to
have
made
act
third
was
the
castle
hall
and
here
hagar
appeared
having
come
to
free
the
lovers
and
finish
hugo
she
hears
him
coming
and
hides
sees
him
put
the
potions
into
two
cups
of
wine
and
bid
the
timid
little
servant
bear
them
to
the
captives
in
their
cells
and
tell
them
i
shall
come
anon
the
servant
takes
hugo
aside
to
tell
him
something
and
hagar
changes
the
cups
for
two
others
which
are
harmless
ferdinando
the
minion
carries
them
away
and
hagar
puts
back
the
cup
which
holds
the
poison
meant
for
roderigo
hugo
getting
thirsty
after
a
long
warble
drinks
it
loses
his
wits
and
after
a
good
deal
of
clutching
and
stamping
falls
flat
and
dies
while
hagar
informs
him
what
she
has
done
in
a
song
of
exquisite
power
and
melody
this
was
a
truly
thrilling
scene
though
some
persons
might
have
thought
that
the
sudden
tumbling
down
of
a
quantity
of
long
hair
rather
marred
the
effect
of
the
villain's
death
he
was
called
before
the
curtain
and
with
great
propriety
appeared
leading
hagar
whose
singing
was
considered
more
wonderful
than
all
the
rest
of
the
performance
put
together
act
fourth
displayed
the
despairing
roderigo
on
the
point
of
stabbing
himself
because
he
has
been
told
that
zara
has
deserted
him
just
as
the
dagger
is
at
his
heart
a
lovely
song
is
sung
under
his
window
informing
him
that
zara
is
true
but
in
danger
and
he
can
save
her
if
he
will
a
key
is
thrown
in
which
unlocks
the
door
and
in
a
spasm
of
rapture
he
tears
off
his
chains
and
rushes
away
to
find
and
rescue
his
lady-love
act
fifth
opened
with
a
stormy
scene
between
zara
and
don
pedro
he
wishes
her
to
go
into
a
convent
but
she
won't
hear
of
it
and
after
a
touching
appeal
is
about
to
faint
when
roderigo
dashes
in
and
demands
her
hand
don
pedro
refuses
because
he
is
not
rich
they
shout
and
gesticulate
tremendously
but
cannot
agree
and
roderigo
is
about
to
bear
away
the
exhausted
zara
when
the
timid
servant
enters
with
a
letter
and
a
bag
from
hagar
who
has
mysteriously
disappeared
the
latter
informs
the
party
that
she
bequeaths
untold
wealth
to
the
young
pair
and
an
awful
doom
to
don
pedro
if
he
doesn't
make
them
happy
the
bag
is
opened
and
several
quarts
of
tin
money
shower
down
upon
the
stage
till
it
is
quite
glorified
with
the
glitter
this
entirely
softens
the
stern
sire
he
consents
without
a
murmur
all
join
in
a
joyful
chorus
and
the
curtain
falls
upon
the
lovers
kneeling
to
receive
don
pedro's
blessing
in
attitudes
of
the
most
romantic
grace
illustration
the
lovers
kneeling
to
receive
don
pedro's
blessing
tumultuous
applause
followed
but
received
an
unexpected

for
the
cot-bed
on
which
the
dress-circle
was
built

up
and
extinguished
the
enthusiastic
audience
roderigo
and
don
pedro
flew
to
the
rescue
and
all
were
taken
out
unhurt
though
many
were
speechless
with
laughter
the
excitement
had
hardly
subsided
when
hannah
appeared
with
mrs
march's
compliments
and
would
the
ladies
walk
down
to
supper
this
was
a
surprise
even
to
the
actors
and
when
they
saw
the
table
they
looked
at
one
another
in
rapturous
amazement
it
was
like
marmee
to
get
up
a
little
treat
for
them
but
anything
so
fine
as
this
was
unheard-of
since
the
departed
days
of
plenty
there
was
ice-cream,--actually
two
dishes
of
it
pink
and
white,--and
cake
and
fruit
and
distracting
french
bonbons
and
in
the
middle
of
the
table
four
great
bouquets
of
hot-house
flowers
it
quite
took
their
breath
away
and
they
stared
first
at
the
table
and
then
at
their
mother
who
looked
as
if
she
enjoyed
it
immensely
is
it
fairies
asked
amy
it's
santa
claus
said
beth
mother
did
it
and
meg
smiled
her
sweetest
in
spite
of
her
gray
beard
and
white
eyebrows
aunt
march
had
a
good
fit
and
sent
the
supper
cried
jo
with
a
sudden
inspiration
all
wrong
old
mr
laurence
sent
it
replied
mrs
march
the
laurence
boy's
grandfather
what
in
the
world
put
such
a
thing
into
his
head
we
don't
know
him
exclaimed
meg
hannah
told
one
of
his
servants
about
your
breakfast
party
he
is
an
odd
old
gentleman
but
that
pleased
him
he
knew
my
father
years
ago
and
he
sent
me
a
polite
note
this
afternoon
saying
he
hoped
i
would
allow
him
to
express
his
friendly
feeling
toward
my
children
by
sending
them
a
few
trifles
in
honor
of
the
day
i
could
not
refuse
and
so
you
have
a
little
feast
at
night
to
make
up
for
the
bread-and-milk
breakfast
that
boy
put
it
into
his
head
i
know
he
did
he's
a
capital
fellow
and
i
wish
we
could
get
acquainted
he
looks
as
if
he'd
like
to
know
us
but
he's
bashful
and
meg
is
so
prim
she
won't
let
me
speak
to
him
when
we
pass
said
jo
as
the
plates
went
round
and
the
ice
began
to
melt
out
of
sight
with
ohs
and
ahs
of
satisfaction
you
mean
the
people
who
live
in
the
big
house
next
door
don't
you
asked
one
of
the
girls
my
mother
knows
old
mr
laurence
but
says
he's
very
proud
and
doesn't
like
to
mix
with
his
neighbors
he
keeps
his
grandson
shut
up
when
he
isn't
riding
or
walking
with
his
tutor
and
makes
him
study
very
hard
we
invited
him
to
our
party
but
he
didn't
come
mother
says
he's
very
nice
though
he
never
speaks
to
us
girls
our
cat
ran
away
once
and
he
brought
her
back
and
we
talked
over
the
fence
and
were
getting
on
capitally,--all
about
cricket
and
so
on,--when
he
saw
meg
coming
and
walked
off
i
mean
to
know
him
some
day
for
he
needs
fun
i'm
sure
he
does
said
jo
decidedly
illustration
we
talked
over
the
fence
i
like
his
manners
and
he
looks
like
a
little
gentleman
so
i've
no
objection
to
your
knowing
him
if
a
proper
opportunity
comes
he
brought
the
flowers
himself
and
i
should
have
asked
him
in
if
i
had
been
sure
what
was
going
on
upstairs
he
looked
so
wistful
as
he
went
away
hearing
the
frolic
and
evidently
having
none
of
his
own
it's
a
mercy
you
didn't
mother
laughed
jo
looking
at
her
boots
but
we'll
have
another
play
some
time
that
he
_can_
see
perhaps
he'll
help
act
wouldn't
that
be
jolly
i
never
had
such
a
fine
bouquet
before
how
pretty
it
is
and
meg
examined
her
flowers
with
great
interest
they
_are_
lovely
but
beth's
roses
are
sweeter
to
me
said
mrs
march
smelling
the
half-dead
posy
in
her
belt
beth
nestled
up
to
her
and
whispered
softly
i
wish
i
could
send
my
bunch
to
father
i'm
afraid
he
isn't
having
such
a
merry
christmas

where

at

here
answered
a
husky
voice
from

running
up
meg
found
her

eating
apples

crying
over
the

wrapped
up
in
a
comforter
on
an
old
three-legged
sofa
by
the
sunny
window
this
was
jo's
favorite
refuge
and
here
she
loved
to
retire
with
half
a
dozen
russets
and
a
nice
book
to
enjoy
the
quiet
and
the
society
of
a
pet
rat
who
lived
near
by
and
didn't
mind
her
a
particle
as
meg
appeared

whisked
into

jo
shook
the

off

hear
the
news
such

only

a
regular
note
of
invitation
from
mrs

it
with

delight
'mrs

would
be
happy
to
see
miss

and
miss
josephine
at
a
little
dance
on
new-year's
eve.'
marmee
is
willing
we
should
go
now
what
_shall_
we
wear
what's
the
use
of
asking
that
when
you
know
we
shall
wear
our
poplins
because
we
haven't
got
anything
else
answered
jo
with
her
mouth
full
if
i
only
had
a
silk
sighed
meg
mother
says
i
may
when
i'm
eighteen
perhaps
but
two
years
is
an
everlasting
time
to
wait
i'm
sure
our
pops
look
like
silk
and
they
are
nice
enough
for
us
yours
is
as
good
as
new
but
i
forgot
the
burn
and
the
tear
in
mine
whatever
shall
i
do
the
burn
shows
badly
and
i
can't
take
any
out
you
must
sit
still
all
you
can
and
keep
your
back
out
of
sight
the
front
is
all
right
i
shall
have
a
new
ribbon
for
my
hair
and
marmee
will
lend
me
her
little
pearl
pin
and
my
new
slippers
are
lovely
and
my
gloves
will
do
though
they
aren't
as
nice
as
i'd
like
mine
are
spoilt
with
lemonade
and
i
can't
get
any
new
ones
so
i
shall
have
to
go
without
said
jo
who
never
troubled
herself
much
about
dress
you
_must_
have
gloves
or
i
won't
go
cried
meg
decidedly
gloves
are
more
important
than
anything
else
you
can't
dance
without
them
and
if
you
don't
i
should
be
_so_
mortified
then
i'll
stay
still
i
don't
care
much
for
company
dancing
it's
no
fun
to
go
sailing
round
i
like
to
fly
about
and
cut
capers
you
can't
ask
mother
for
new
ones
they
are
so
expensive
and
you
are
so
careless
she
said
when
you
spoilt
the
others
that
she
shouldn't
get
you
any
more
this
winter
can't
you
make
them
do
asked
meg
anxiously
i
can
hold
them
crumpled
up
in
my
hand
so
no
one
will
know
how
stained
they
are
that's
all
i
can
do
no
i'll
tell
you
how
we
can
manage--each
wear
one
good
one
and
carry
a
bad
one
don't
you
see
your
hands
are
bigger
than
mine
and
you
will
stretch
my
glove
dreadfully
began
meg
whose
gloves
were
a
tender
point
with
her
then
i'll
go
without
i
don't
care
what
people
say
cried
jo
taking
up
her
book
you
may
have
it
you
may
only
don't
stain
it
and
do
behave
nicely
don't
put
your
hands
behind
you
or
stare
or
say
'christopher
columbus!'
will
you
don't
worry
about
me
i'll
be
as
prim
as
i
can
and
not
get
into
any
scrapes
if
i
can
help
it
now
go
and
answer
your
note
and
let
me
finish
this
splendid
story
so
meg
went
away
to
accept
with
thanks
look
over
her
dress
and
sing
blithely
as
she
did
up
her
one
real
lace
frill
while
jo
finished
her
story
her
four
apples
and
had
a
game
of
romps
with
scrabble
on
new-year's
eve
the
parlor
was
deserted
for
the
two
younger
girls
played
dressing-maids
and
the
two
elder
were
absorbed
in
the
all-important
business
of
getting
ready
for
the
party
simple
as
the
toilets
were
there
was
a
great
deal
of
running
up
and
down
laughing
and
talking
and
at
one
time
a
strong
smell
of
burnt
hair
pervaded
the
house
meg
wanted
a
few
curls
about
her
face
and
jo
undertook
to
pinch
the
papered
locks
with
a
pair
of
hot
tongs
illustration
jo
undertook
to
pinch
the
papered
locks
ought
they
to
smoke
like
that
asked
beth
from
her
perch
on
the
bed
it's
the
dampness
drying
replied
jo
what
a
queer
smell
it's
like
burnt
feathers
observed
amy
smoothing
her
own
pretty
curls
with
a
superior
air
there
now
i'll
take
off
the
papers
and
you'll
see
a
cloud
of
little
ringlets
said
jo
putting
down
the
tongs
she
did
take
off
the
papers
but
no
cloud
of
ringlets
appeared
for
the
hair
came
with
the
papers
and
the
horrified
hair-dresser
laid
a
row
of
little
scorched
bundles
on
the
bureau
before
her
victim
oh
oh
oh
what
_have_
you
done
i'm
spoilt
i
can't
go
my
hair
oh
my
hair
wailed
meg
looking
with
despair
at
the
uneven
frizzle
on
her
forehead
just
my
luck
you
shouldn't
have
asked
me
to
do
it
i
always
spoil
everything
i'm
so
sorry
but
the
tongs
were
too
hot
and
so
i've
made
a
mess
groaned
poor
jo
regarding
the
black
pancakes
with
tears
of
regret
it
isn't
spoilt
just
frizzle
it
and
tie
your
ribbon
so
the
ends
come
on
your
forehead
a
bit
and
it
will
look
like
the
last
fashion
i've
seen
many
girls
do
it
so
said
amy
consolingly
serves
me
right
for
trying
to
be
fine
i
wish
i'd
let
my
hair
alone
cried
meg
petulantly
so
do
i
it
was
so
smooth
and
pretty
but
it
will
soon
grow
out
again
said
beth
coming
to
kiss
and
comfort
the
shorn
sheep
after
various
lesser
mishaps
meg
was
finished
at
last
and
by
the
united
exertions
of
the
family
jo's
hair
was
got
up
and
her
dress
on
they
looked
very
well
in
their
simple
suits,--meg
in
silvery
drab
with
a
blue
velvet
snood
lace
frills
and
the
pearl
pin
jo
in
maroon
with
a
stiff
gentlemanly
linen
collar
and
a
white
chrysanthemum
or
two
for
her
only
ornament
each
put
on
one
nice
light
glove
and
carried
one
soiled
one
and
all
pronounced
the
effect
quite
easy
and
fine
meg's
high-heeled
slippers
were
very
tight
and
hurt
her
though
she
would
not
own
it
and
jo's
nineteen
hair-pins
all
seemed
stuck
straight
into
her
head
which
was
not
exactly
comfortable
but
dear
me
let
us
be
elegant
or
die
have
a
good
time
dearies
said
mrs
march
as
the
sisters
went
daintily
down
the
walk
don't
eat
much
supper
and
come
away
at
eleven
when
i
send
hannah
for
you
as
the
gate
clashed
behind
them
a
voice
cried
from
a
window,--
girls
girls
_have_
you
both
got
nice
pocket-handkerchiefs
yes
yes
spandy
nice
and
meg
has
cologne
on
hers
cried
jo
adding
with
a
laugh
as
they
went
on
i
do
believe
marmee
would
ask
that
if
we
were
all
running
away
from
an
earthquake
it
is
one
of
her
aristocratic
tastes
and
quite
proper
for
a
real
lady
is
always
known
by
neat
boots
gloves
and
handkerchief
replied
meg
who
had
a
good
many
little
aristocratic
tastes
of
her
own
now
don't
forget
to
keep
the
bad
breadth
out
of
sight
jo
is
my
sash
right
and
does
my
hair
look
_very_
bad
said
meg
as
she
turned
from
the
glass
in
mrs
gardiner's
dressing-room
after
a
prolonged
prink
i
know
i
shall
forget
if
you
see
me
doing
anything
wrong
just
remind
me
by
a
wink
will
you
returned
jo
giving
her
collar
a
twitch
and
her
head
a
hasty
brush
no
winking
isn't
lady-like
i'll
lift
my
eyebrows
if
anything
is
wrong
and
nod
if
you
are
all
right
now
hold
your
shoulders
straight
and
take
short
steps
and
don't
shake
hands
if
you
are
introduced
to
any
one
it
isn't
the
thing
how
_do_
you
learn
all
the
proper
ways
i
never
can
isn't
that
music
gay
illustration
mrs
gardiner
greeted
them
down
they
went
feeling
a
trifle
timid
for
they
seldom
went
to
parties
and
informal
as
this
little
gathering
was
it
was
an
event
to
them
mrs
gardiner
a
stately
old
lady
greeted
them
kindly
and
handed
them
over
to
the
eldest
of
her
six
daughters
meg
knew
sallie
and
was
at
her
ease
very
soon
but
jo
who
didn't
care
much
for
girls
or
girlish
gossip
stood
about
with
her
back
carefully
against
the
wall
and
felt
as
much
out
of
place
as
a
colt
in
a
flower-garden
half
a
dozen
jovial
lads
were
talking
about
skates
in
another
part
of
the
room
and
she
longed
to
go
and
join
them
for
skating
was
one
of
the
joys
of
her
life
she
telegraphed
her
wish
to
meg
but
the
eyebrows
went
up
so
alarmingly
that
she
dared
not
stir
no
one
came
to
talk
to
her
and
one
by
one
the
group
near
her
dwindled
away
till
she
was
left
alone
she
could
not
roam
about
and
amuse
herself
for
the
burnt
breadth
would
show
so
she
stared
at
people
rather
forlornly
till
the
dancing
began
meg
was
asked
at
once
and
the
tight
slippers
tripped
about
so
briskly
that
none
would
have
guessed
the
pain
their
wearer
suffered
smilingly
jo
saw
a
big
red-headed
youth
approaching
her
corner
and
fearing
he
meant
to
engage
her
she
slipped
into
a
curtained
recess
intending
to
peep
and
enjoy
herself
in
peace
unfortunately
another
bashful
person
had
chosen
the
same
refuge
for
as
the
curtain
fell
behind
her
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
laurence
boy
illustration
face
to
face
with
the
laurence
boy
dear
me
i
didn't
know
any
one
was
here
stammered
jo
preparing
to
back
out
as
speedily
as
she
had
bounced
in
but
the
boy
laughed
and
said
pleasantly
though
he
looked
a
little
startled,--
don't
mind
me
stay
if
you
like
sha'n't
i
disturb
you
not
a
bit
i
only
came
here
because
i
don't
know
many
people
and
felt
rather
strange
at
first
you
know
so
did
i
don't
go
away
please
unless
you'd
rather
the
boy
sat
down
again
and
looked
at
his
pumps
till
jo
said
trying
to
be
polite
and
easy,--
i
think
i've
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
you
live
near
us
don't
you
next
door
and
he
looked
up
and
laughed
outright
for
jo's
prim
manner
was
rather
funny
when
he
remembered
how
they
had
chatted
about
cricket
when
he
brought
the
cat
home
that
put
jo
at
her
ease
and
she
laughed
too
as
she
said
in
her
heartiest
way,--
we
did
have
such
a
good
time
over
your
nice
christmas
present
grandpa
sent
it
but
you
put
it
into
his
head
didn't
you
now
how
is
your
cat
miss
march
asked
the
boy
trying
to
look
sober
while
his
black
eyes
shone
with
fun
nicely
thank
you
mr
laurence
but
i
am
not
miss
march
i'm
only
jo
returned
the
young
lady
i'm
not
mr
laurence
i'm
only
laurie
laurie
laurence,--what
an
odd
name
my
first
name
is
theodore
but
i
don't
like
it
for
the
fellows
called
me
dora
so
i
made
them
say
laurie
instead
i
hate
my
name
too--so
sentimental
i
wish
every
one
would
say
jo
instead
of
josephine
how
did
you
make
the
boys
stop
calling
you
dora
i
thrashed
'em
i
can't
thrash
aunt
march
so
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
bear
it
and
jo
resigned
herself
with
a
sigh
don't
you
like
to
dance
miss
jo
asked
laurie
looking
as
if
he
thought
the
name
suited
her
i
like
it
well
enough
if
there
is
plenty
of
room
and
every
one
is
lively
in
a
place
like
this
i'm
sure
to
upset
something
tread
on
people's
toes
or
do
something
dreadful
so
i
keep
out
of
mischief
and
let
meg
sail
about
don't
you
dance
sometimes
you
see
i've
been
abroad
a
good
many
years
and
haven't
been
into
company
enough
yet
to
know
how
you
do
things
here
abroad
cried
jo
oh
tell
me
about
it
i
love
dearly
to
hear
people
describe
their
travels
laurie
didn't
seem
to
know
where
to
begin
but
jo's
eager
questions
soon
set
him
going
and
he
told
her
how
he
had
been
at
school
in
vevay
where
the
boys
never
wore
hats
and
had
a
fleet
of
boats
on
the
lake
and
for
holiday
fun
went
walking
trips
about
switzerland
with
their
teachers
don't
i
wish
i'd
been
there
cried
jo
did
you
go
to
paris
we
spent
last
winter
there
can
you
talk
french
we
were
not
allowed
to
speak
any
thing
else
at
vevay
do
say
some
i
can
read
it
but
can't
pronounce
quel
nom
a
cette
jeune
demoiselle
en
les
pantoufles
jolis
said
laurie
good-naturedly
how
nicely
you
do
it
let
me
see,--you
said
'who
is
the
young
lady
in
the
pretty
slippers,'
didn't
you
oui
mademoiselle
it's
my
sister
margaret
and
you
knew
it
was
do
you
think
she
is
pretty
yes
she
makes
me
think
of
the
german
girls
she
looks
so
fresh
and
quiet
and
dances
like
a
lady
jo
quite
glowed
with
pleasure
at
this
boyish
praise
of
her
sister
and
stored
it
up
to
repeat
to
meg
both
peeped
and
criticised
and
chatted
till
they
felt
like
old
acquaintances
laurie's
bashfulness
soon
wore
off
for
jo's
gentlemanly
demeanor
amused
and
set
him
at
his
ease
and
jo
was
her
merry
self
again
because
her
dress
was
forgotten
and
nobody
lifted
their
eyebrows
at
her
she
liked
the
laurence
boy
better
than
ever
and
took
several
good
looks
at
him
so
that
she
might
describe
him
to
the
girls
for
they
had
no
brothers
very
few
male
cousins
and
boys
were
almost
unknown
creatures
to
them
curly
black
hair
brown
skin
big
black
eyes
handsome
nose
fine
teeth
small
hands
and
feet
taller
than
i
am
very
polite
for
a
boy
and
altogether
jolly
wonder
how
old
he
is
it
was
on
the
tip
of
jo's
tongue
to
ask
but
she
checked
herself
in
time
and
with
unusual
tact
tried
to
find
out
in
a
roundabout
way
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
college
soon
i
see
you
pegging
away
at
your
books,--no
i
mean
studying
hard
and
jo
blushed
at
the
dreadful
pegging
which
had
escaped
her
laurie
smiled
but
didn't
seem
shocked
and
answered
with
a
shrug,--
not
for
a
year
or
two
i
won't
go
before
seventeen
anyway
aren't
you
but
fifteen
asked
jo
looking
at
the
tall
lad
whom
she
had
imagined
seventeen
already
sixteen
next
month
how
i
wish
i
was
going
to
college
you
don't
look
as
if
you
liked
it
i
hate
it
nothing
but
grinding
or
skylarking
and
i
don't
like
the
way
fellows
do
either
in
this
country
what
do
you
like
to
live
in
italy
and
to
enjoy
myself
in
my
own
way
jo
wanted
very
much
to
ask
what
his
own
way
was
but
his
black
brows
looked
rather
threatening
as
he
knit
them
so
she
changed
the
subject
by
saying
as
her
foot
kept
time
that's
a
splendid
polka
why
don't
you
go
and
try
it
if
you
will
come
too
he
answered
with
a
gallant
little
bow
i
can't
for
i
told
meg
i
wouldn't
because--
there
jo
stopped
and
looked
undecided
whether
to
tell
or
to
laugh
because
what
asked
laurie
curiously
you
won't
tell
never
well
i
have
a
bad
trick
of
standing
before
the
fire
and
so
i
burn
my
frocks
and
i
scorched
this
one
and
though
it's
nicely
mended
it
shows
and
meg
told
me
to
keep
still
so
no
one
would
see
it
you
may
laugh
if
you
want
to
it
is
funny
i
know
but
laurie
didn't
laugh
he
only
looked
down
a
minute
and
the
expression
of
his
face
puzzled
jo
when
he
said
very
gently,--
never
mind
that
i'll
tell
you
how
we
can
manage
there's
a
long
hall
out
there
and
we
can
dance
grandly
and
no
one
will
see
us
please
come
jo
thanked
him
and
gladly
went
wishing
she
had
two
neat
gloves
when
she
saw
the
nice
pearl-colored
ones
her
partner
wore
the
hall
was
empty
and
they
had
a
grand
polka
for
laurie
danced
well
and
taught
her
the
german
step
which
delighted
jo
being
full
of
swing
and
spring
when
the
music
stopped
they
sat
down
on
the
stairs
to
get
their
breath
and
laurie
was
in
the
midst
of
an
account
of
a
students'
festival
at
heidelberg
when
meg
appeared
in
search
of
her
sister
she
beckoned
and
jo
reluctantly
followed
her
into
a
side-room
where
she
found
her
on
a
sofa
holding
her
foot
and
looking
pale
illustration
they
sat
down
on
the
stairs
i've
sprained
my
ankle
that
stupid
high
heel
turned
and
gave
me
a
sad
wrench
it
aches
so
i
can
hardly
stand
and
i
don't
know
how
i'm
ever
going
to
get
home
she
said
rocking
to
and
fro
in
pain
i
knew
you'd
hurt
your
feet
with
those
silly
shoes
i'm
sorry
but
i
don't
see
what
you
can
do
except
get
a
carriage
or
stay
here
all
night
answered
jo
softly
rubbing
the
poor
ankle
as
she
spoke
i
can't
have
a
carriage
without
its
costing
ever
so
much
i
dare
say
i
can't
get
one
at
all
for
most
people
come
in
their
own
and
it's
a
long
way
to
the
stable
and
no
one
to
send
i'll
go
no
indeed
it's
past
nine
and
dark
as
egypt
i
can't
stop
here
for
the
house
is
full
sallie
has
some
girls
staying
with
her
i'll
rest
till
hannah
comes
and
then
do
the
best
i
can
i'll
ask
laurie
he
will
go
said
jo
looking
relieved
as
the
idea
occurred
to
her
mercy
no
don't
ask
or
tell
any
one
get
me
my
rubbers
and
put
these
slippers
with
our
things
i
can't
dance
any
more
but
as
soon
as
supper
is
over
watch
for
hannah
and
tell
me
the
minute
she
comes
they
are
going
out
to
supper
now
i'll
stay
with
you
i'd
rather
no
dear
run
along
and
bring
me
some
coffee
i'm
so
tired
i
can't
stir
so
meg
reclined
with
rubbers
well
hidden
and
jo
went
blundering
away
to
the
dining-room
which
she
found
after
going
into
a
china-closet
and
opening
the
door
of
a
room
where
old
mr
gardiner
was
taking
a
little
private
refreshment
making
a
dart
at
the
table
she
secured
the
coffee
which
she
immediately
spilt
thereby
making
the
front
of
her
dress
as
bad
as
the
back
oh
dear
what
a
blunderbuss
i
am
exclaimed
jo
finishing
meg's
glove
by
scrubbing
her
gown
with
it
can
i
help
you
said
a
friendly
voice
and
there
was
laurie
with
a
full
cup
in
one
hand
and
a
plate
of
ice
in
the
other
i
was
trying
to
get
something
for
meg
who
is
very
tired
and
some
one
shook
me
and
here
i
am
in
a
nice
state
answered
jo
glancing
dismally
from
the
stained
skirt
to
the
coffee-colored
glove
too
bad
i
was
looking
for
some
one
to
give
this
to
may
i
take
it
to
your
sister
oh
thank
you
i'll
show
you
where
she
is
i
don't
offer
to
take
it
myself
for
i
should
only
get
into
another
scrape
if
i
did
jo
led
the
way
and
as
if
used
to
waiting
on
ladies
laurie
drew
up
a
little
table
brought
a
second
instalment
of
coffee
and
ice
for
jo
and
was
so
obliging
that
even
particular
meg
pronounced
him
a
nice
boy
they
had
a
merry
time
over
the
bonbons
and
mottoes
and
were
in
the
midst
of
a
quiet
game
of
buzz
with
two
or
three
other
young
people
who
had
strayed
in
when
hannah
appeared
meg
forgot
her
foot
and
rose
so
quickly
that
she
was
forced
to
catch
hold
of
jo
with
an
exclamation
of
pain
hush
don't
say
anything
she
whispered
adding
aloud
it's
nothing
i
turned
my
foot
a
little
that's
all
and
limped
up-stairs
to
put
her
things
on
hannah
scolded
meg
cried
and
jo
was
at
her
wits'
end
till
she
decided
to
take
things
into
her
own
hands
slipping
out
she
ran
down
and
finding
a
servant
asked
if
he
could
get
her
a
carriage
it
happened
to
be
a
hired
waiter
who
knew
nothing
about
the
neighborhood
and
jo
was
looking
round
for
help
when
laurie
who
had
heard
what
she
said
came
up
and
offered
his
grandfather's
carriage
which
had
just
come
for
him
he
said
it's
so
early
you
can't
mean
to
go
yet
began
jo
looking
relieved
but
hesitating
to
accept
the
offer
i
always
go
early,--i
do
truly
please
let
me
take
you
home
it's
all
on
my
way
you
know
and
it
rains
they
say
that
settled
it
and
telling
him
of
meg's
mishap
jo
gratefully
accepted
and
rushed
up
to
bring
down
the
rest
of
the
party
hannah
hated
rain
as
much
as
a
cat
does
so
she
made
no
trouble
and
they
rolled
away
in
the
luxurious
close
carriage
feeling
very
festive
and
elegant
laurie
went
on
the
box
so
meg
could
keep
her
foot
up
and
the
girls
talked
over
their
party
in
freedom
i
had
a
capital
time
did
you
asked
jo
rumpling
up
her
hair
and
making
herself
comfortable
yes
till
i
hurt
myself
sallie's
friend
annie
moffat
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
asked
me
to
come
and
spend
a
week
with
her
when
sallie
does
she
is
going
in
the
spring
when
the
opera
comes
and
it
will
be
perfectly
splendid
if
mother
only
lets
me
go
answered
meg
cheering
up
at
the
thought
i
saw
you
dancing
with
the
red-headed
man
i
ran
away
from
was
he
nice
oh
very
his
hair
is
auburn
not
red
and
he
was
very
polite
and
i
had
a
delicious
redowa
with
him
he
looked
like
a
grasshopper
in
a
fit
when
he
did
the
new
step
laurie
and
i
couldn't
help
laughing
did
you
hear
us
no
but
it
was
very
rude
what
_were_
you
about
all
that
time
hidden
away
there
jo
told
her
adventures
and
by
the
time
she
had
finished
they
were
at
home
with
many
thanks
they
said
good
night
and
crept
in
hoping
to
disturb
no
one
but
the
instant
their
door
creaked
two
little
night-caps
bobbed
up
and
two
sleepy
but
eager
voices
cried
out,--
tell
about
the
party
tell
about
the
party
with
what
meg
called
a
great
want
of
manners
jo
had
saved
some
bonbons
for
the
little
girls
and
they
soon
subsided
after
hearing
the
most
thrilling
events
of
the
evening
i
declare
it
really
seems
like
being
a
fine
young
lady
to
come
home
from
the
party
in
a
carriage
and
sit
in
my
dressing-gown
with
a
maid
to
wait
on
me
said
meg
as
jo
bound
up
her
foot
with
arnica
and
brushed
her
hair
i
don't
believe
fine
young
ladies
enjoy
themselves
a
bit
more
than
we
do
in
spite
of
our
burnt
hair
old
gowns
one
glove
apiece
and
tight
slippers
that
sprain
our
ankles
when
we
are
silly
enough
to
wear
them
and
i
think
jo
was
quite
right
illustration
tell
about
the
party
illustration
the
kitten
stuck
like
a
burr
just
out
of
reach
iv
burdens
oh
dear
how
hard
it
does
seem
to
take
up
our
packs
and
go
on
sighed
meg
the
morning
after
the
party
for
now
the
holidays
were
over
the
week
of
merry-making
did
not
fit
her
for
going
on
easily
with
the
task
she
never
liked
i
wish
it
was
christmas
or
new-year
all
the
time
wouldn't
it
be
fun
answered
jo
yawning
dismally
we
shouldn't
enjoy
ourselves
half
so
much
as
we
do
now
but
it
does
seem
so
nice
to
have
little
suppers
and
bouquets
and
go
to
parties
and
drive
home
and
read
and
rest
and
not
work
it's
like
other
people
you
know
and
i
always
envy
girls
who
do
such
things
i'm
so
fond
of
luxury
said
meg
trying
to
decide
which
of
two
shabby
gowns
was
the
least
shabby
well
we
can't
have
it
so
don't
let
us
grumble
but
shoulder
our
bundles
and
trudge
along
as
cheerfully
as
marmee
does
i'm
sure
aunt
march
is
a
regular
old
man
of
the
sea
to
me
but
i
suppose
when
i've
learned
to
carry
her
without
complaining
she
will
tumble
off
or
get
so
light
that
i
sha'n't
mind
her
this
idea
tickled
jo's
fancy
and
put
her
in
good
spirits
but
meg
didn't
brighten
for
her
burden
consisting
of
four
spoilt
children
seemed
heavier
than
ever
she
hadn't
heart
enough
even
to
make
herself
pretty
as
usual
by
putting
on
a
blue
neck-ribbon
and
dressing
her
hair
in
the
most
becoming
way
where's
the
use
of
looking
nice
when
no
one
sees
me
but
those
cross
midgets
and
no
one
cares
whether
i'm
pretty
or
not
she
muttered
shutting
her
drawer
with
a
jerk
i
shall
have
to
toil
and
moil
all
my
days
with
only
little
bits
of
fun
now
and
then
and
get
old
and
ugly
and
sour
because
i'm
poor
and
can't
enjoy
my
life
as
other
girls
do
it's
a
shame
so
meg
went
down
wearing
an
injured
look
and
wasn't
at
all
agreeable
at
breakfast-time
every
one
seemed
rather
out
of
sorts
and
inclined
to
croak
beth
had
a
headache
and
lay
on
the
sofa
trying
to
comfort
herself
with
the
cat
and
three
kittens
amy
was
fretting
because
her
lessons
were
not
learned
and
she
couldn't
find
her
rubbers
jo
_would_
whistle
and
make
a
great
racket
getting
ready
mrs
march
was
very
busy
trying
to
finish
a
letter
which
must
go
at
once
and
hannah
had
the
grumps
for
being
up
late
didn't
suit
her
there
never
_was_
such
a
cross
family
cried
jo
losing
her
temper
when
she
had
upset
an
inkstand
broken
both
boot-lacings
and
sat
down
upon
her
hat
you're
the
crossest
person
in
it
returned
amy
washing
out
the
sum
that
was
all
wrong
with
the
tears
that
had
fallen
on
her
slate
beth
if
you
don't
keep
these
horrid
cats
down
cellar
i'll
have
them
drowned
exclaimed
meg
angrily
as
she
tried
to
get
rid
of
the
kitten
which
had
scrambled
up
her
back
and
stuck
like
a
burr
just
out
of
reach
jo
laughed
meg
scolded
beth
implored
and
amy
wailed
because
she
couldn't
remember
how
much
nine
times
twelve
was
girls
girls
do
be
quiet
one
minute
i
_must_
get
this
off
by
the
early
mail
and
you
drive
me
distracted
with
your
worry
cried
mrs
march
crossing
out
the
third
spoilt
sentence
in
her
letter
there
was
a
momentary
lull
broken
by
hannah
who
stalked
in
laid
two
hot
turn-overs
on
the
table
and
stalked
out
again
these
turn-overs
were
an
institution
and
the
girls
called
them
muffs
for
they
had
no
others
and
found
the
hot
pies
very
comforting
to
their
hands
on
cold
mornings
hannah
never
forgot
to
make
them
no
matter
how
busy
or
grumpy
she
might
be
for
the
walk
was
long
and
bleak
the
poor
things
got
no
other
lunch
and
were
seldom
home
before
two
cuddle
your
cats
and
get
over
your
headache
bethy
good-by
marmee
we
are
a
set
of
rascals
this
morning
but
we'll
come
home
regular
angels
now
then
meg
and
jo
tramped
away
feeling
that
the
pilgrims
were
not
setting
out
as
they
ought
to
do
they
always
looked
back
before
turning
the
corner
for
their
mother
was
always
at
the
window
to
nod
and
smile
and
wave
her
hand
to
them
somehow
it
seemed
as
if
they
couldn't
have
got
through
the
day
without
that
for
whatever
their
mood
might
be
the
last
glimpse
of
that
motherly
face
was
sure
to
affect
them
like
sunshine
if
marmee
shook
her
fist
instead
of
kissing
her
hand
to
us
it
would
serve
us
right
for
more
ungrateful
wretches
than
we
are
were
never
seen
cried
jo
taking
a
remorseful
satisfaction
in
the
snowy
walk
and
bitter
wind
don't
use
such
dreadful
expressions
said
meg
from
the
depths
of
the
vail
in
which
she
had
shrouded
herself
like
a
nun
sick
of
the
world
i
like
good
strong
words
that
mean
something
replied
jo
catching
her
hat
as
it
took
a
leap
off
her
head
preparatory
to
flying
away
altogether
call
yourself
any
names
you
like
but
_i_
am
neither
a
rascal
nor
a
wretch
and
i
don't
choose
to
be
called
so
you're
a
blighted
being
and
decidedly
cross
to-day
because
you
can't
sit
in
the
lap
of
luxury
all
the
time
poor
dear
just
wait
till
i
make
my
fortune
and
you
shall
revel
in
carriages
and
ice-cream
and
high-heeled
slippers
and
posies
and
red-headed
boys
to
dance
with
how
ridiculous
you
are
jo
but
meg
laughed
at
the
nonsense
and
felt
better
in
spite
of
herself
lucky
for
you
i
am
for
if
i
put
on
crushed
airs
and
tried
to
be
dismal
as
you
do
we
should
be
in
a
nice
state
thank
goodness
i
can
always
find
something
funny
to
keep
me
up
don't
croak
any
more
but
come
home
jolly
there's
a
dear
jo
gave
her
sister
an
encouraging
pat
on
the
shoulder
as
they
parted
for
the
day
each
going
a
different
way
each
hugging
her
little
warm
turn-over
and
each
trying
to
be
cheerful
in
spite
of
wintry
weather
hard
work
and
the
unsatisfied
desires
of
pleasure-loving
youth
when
mr
march
lost
his
property
in
trying
to
help
an
unfortunate
friend
the
two
oldest
girls
begged
to
be
allowed
to
do
something
toward
their
own
support
at
least
believing
that
they
could
not
begin
too
early
to
cultivate
energy
industry
and
independence
their
parents
consented
and
both
fell
to
work
with
the
hearty
good-will
which
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
is
sure
to
succeed
at
last
margaret
found
a
place
as
nursery
governess
and
felt
rich
with
her
small
salary
as
she
said
she
_was_
fond
of
luxury
and
her
chief
trouble
was
poverty
she
found
it
harder
to
bear
than
the
others
because
she
could
remember
a
time
when
home
was
beautiful
life
full
of
ease
and
pleasure
and
want
of
any
kind
unknown
she
tried
not
to
be
envious
or
discontented
but
it
was
very
natural
that
the
young
girl
should
long
for
pretty
things
gay
friends
accomplishments
and
a
happy
life
at
the
kings'
she
daily
saw
all
she
wanted
for
the
children's
older
sisters
were
just
out
and
meg
caught
frequent
glimpses
of
dainty
ball-dresses
and
bouquets
heard
lively
gossip
about
theatres
concerts
sleighing
parties
and
merry-makings
of
all
kinds
and
saw
money
lavished
on
trifles
which
would
have
been
so
precious
to
her
poor
meg
seldom
complained
but
a
sense
of
injustice
made
her
feel
bitter
toward
every
one
sometimes
for
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
know
how
rich
she
was
in
the
blessings
which
alone
can
make
life
happy
jo
happened
to
suit
aunt
march
who
was
lame
and
needed
an
active
person
to
wait
upon
her
the
childless
old
lady
had
offered
to
adopt
one
of
the
girls
when
the
troubles
came
and
was
much
offended
because
her
offer
was
declined
other
friends
told
the
marches
that
they
had
lost
all
chance
of
being
remembered
in
the
rich
old
lady's
will
but
the
unworldly
marches
only
said,--
we
can't
give
up
our
girls
for
a
dozen
fortunes
rich
or
poor
we
will
keep
together
and
be
happy
in
one
another
the
old
lady
wouldn't
speak
to
them
for
a
time
but
happening
to
meet
jo
at
a
friend's
something
in
her
comical
face
and
blunt
manners
struck
the
old
lady's
fancy
and
she
proposed
to
take
her
for
a
companion
this
did
not
suit
jo
at
all
but
she
accepted
the
place
since
nothing
better
appeared
and
to
every
one's
surprise
got
on
remarkably
well
with
her
irascible
relative
there
was
an
occasional
tempest
and
once
jo
had
marched
home
declaring
she
couldn't
bear
it
any
longer
but
aunt
march
always
cleared
up
quickly
and
sent
for
her
back
again
with
such
urgency
that
she
could
not
refuse
for
in
her
heart
she
rather
liked
the
peppery
old
lady
i
suspect
that
the
real
attraction
was
a
large
library
of
fine
books
which
was
left
to
dust
and
spiders
since
uncle
march
died
jo
remembered
the
kind
old
gentleman
who
used
to
let
her
build
railroads
and
bridges
with
his
big
dictionaries
tell
her
stories
about
the
queer
pictures
in
his
latin
books
and
buy
her
cards
of
gingerbread
whenever
he
met
her
in
the
street
the
dim
dusty
room
with
the
busts
staring
down
from
the
tall
book-cases
the
cosy
chairs
the
globes
and
best
of
all
the
wilderness
of
books
in
which
she
could
wander
where
she
liked
made
the
library
a
region
of
bliss
to
her
the
moment
aunt
march
took
her
nap
or
was
busy
with
company
jo
hurried
to
this
quiet
place
and
curling
herself
up
in
the
easy-chair
devoured
poetry
romance
history
travels
and
pictures
like
a
regular
book-worm
but
like
all
happiness
it
did
not
last
long
for
as
sure
as
she
had
just
reached
the
heart
of
the
story
the
sweetest
verse
of
the
song
or
the
most
perilous
adventure
of
her
traveller
a
shrill
voice
called
josy-phine
josy-phine
and
she
had
to
leave
her
paradise
to
wind
yarn
wash
the
poodle
or
read
belsham's
essays
by
the
hour
together
illustration
curling
herself
up
in
the
big
chair
jo's
ambition
was
to
do
something
very
splendid
what
it
was
she
had
no
idea
as
yet
but
left
it
for
time
to
tell
her
and
meanwhile
found
her
greatest
affliction
in
the
fact
that
she
couldn't
read
run
and
ride
as
much
as
she
liked
a
quick
temper
sharp
tongue
and
restless
spirit
were
always
getting
her
into
scrapes
and
her
life
was
a
series
of
ups
and
downs
which
were
both
comic
and
pathetic
but
the
training
she
received
at
aunt
march's
was
just
what
she
needed
and
the
thought
that
she
was
doing
something
to
support
herself
made
her
happy
in
spite
of
the
perpetual
josy-phine
beth
was
too
bashful
to
go
to
school
it
had
been
tried
but
she
suffered
so
much
that
it
was
given
up
and
she
did
her
lessons
at
home
with
her
father
even
when
he
went
away
and
her
mother
was
called
to
devote
her
skill
and
energy
to
soldiers'
aid
societies
beth
went
faithfully
on
by
herself
and
did
the
best
she
could
she
was
a
housewifely
little
creature
and
helped
hannah
keep
home
neat
and
comfortable
for
the
workers
never
thinking
of
any
reward
but
to
be
loved
long
quiet
days
she
spent
not
lonely
nor
idle
for
her
little
world
was
peopled
with
imaginary
friends
and
she
was
by
nature
a
busy
bee
there
were
six
dolls
to
be
taken
up
and
dressed
every
morning
for
beth
was
a
child
still
and
loved
her
pets
as
well
as
ever
not
one
whole
or
handsome
one
among
them
all
were
outcasts
till
beth
took
them
in
for
when
her
sisters
outgrew
these
idols
they
passed
to
her
because
amy
would
have
nothing
old
or
ugly
beth
cherished
them
all
the
more
tenderly
for
that
very
reason
and
set
up
a
hospital
for
infirm
dolls
no
pins
were
ever
stuck
into
their
cotton
vitals
no
harsh
words
or
blows
were
ever
given
them
no
neglect
ever
saddened
the
heart
of
the
most
repulsive
but
all
were
fed
and
clothed
nursed
and
caressed
with
an
affection
which
never
failed
one
forlorn
fragment
of
_dollanity_
had
belonged
to
jo
and
having
led
a
tempestuous
life
was
left
a
wreck
in
the
rag-bag
from
which
dreary
poorhouse
it
was
rescued
by
beth
and
taken
to
her
refuge
having
no
top
to
its
head
she
tied
on
a
neat
little
cap
and
as
both
arms
and
legs
were
gone
she
hid
these
deficiencies
by
folding
it
in
a
blanket
and
devoting
her
best
bed
to
this
chronic
invalid
if
any
one
had
known
the
care
lavished
on
that
dolly
i
think
it
would
have
touched
their
hearts
even
while
they
laughed
she
brought
it
bits
of
bouquets
she
read
to
it
took
it
out
to
breathe
the
air
hidden
under
her
coat
she
sung
it
lullabys
and
never
went
to
bed
without
kissing
its
dirty
face
and
whispering
tenderly
i
hope
you'll
have
a
good
night
my
poor
dear
beth
had
her
troubles
as
well
as
the
others
and
not
being
an
angel
but
a
very
human
little
girl
she
often
wept
a
little
weep
as
jo
said
because
she
couldn't
take
music
lessons
and
have
a
fine
piano
she
loved
music
so
dearly
tried
so
hard
to
learn
and
practised
away
so
patiently
at
the
jingling
old
instrument
that
it
did
seem
as
if
some
one
not
to
hint
aunt
march
ought
to
help
her
nobody
did
however
and
nobody
saw
beth
wipe
the
tears
off
the
yellow
keys
that
wouldn't
keep
in
tune
when
she
was
all
alone
she
sang
like
a
little
lark
about
her
work
never
was
too
tired
to
play
for
marmee
and
the
girls
and
day
after
day
said
hopefully
to
herself
i
know
i'll
get
my
music
some
time
if
i'm
good
there
are
many
beths
in
the
world
shy
and
quiet
sitting
in
corners
till
needed
and
living
for
others
so
cheerfully
that
no
one
sees
the
sacrifices
till
the
little
cricket
on
the
hearth
stops
chirping
and
the
sweet
sunshiny
presence
vanishes
leaving
silence
and
shadow
behind
if
anybody
had
asked
amy
what
the
greatest
trial
of
her
life
was
she
would
have
answered
at
once
my
nose
when
she
was
a
baby
jo
had
accidentally
dropped
her
into
the
coal-hod
and
amy
insisted
that
the
fall
had
ruined
her
nose
forever
it
was
not
big
nor
red
like
poor
petrea's
it
was
only
rather
flat
and
all
the
pinching
in
the
world
could
not
give
it
an
aristocratic
point
no
one
minded
it
but
herself
and
it
was
doing
its
best
to
grow
but
amy
felt
deeply
the
want
of
a
grecian
nose
and
drew
whole
sheets
of
handsome
ones
to
console
herself
little
raphael
as
her
sisters
called
her
had
a
decided
talent
for
drawing
and
was
never
so
happy
as
when
copying
flowers
designing
fairies
or
illustrating
stories
with
queer
specimens
of
art
her
teachers
complained
that
instead
of
doing
her
sums
she
covered
her
slate
with
animals
the
blank
pages
of
her
atlas
were
used
to
copy
maps
on
and
caricatures
of
the
most
ludicrous
description
came
fluttering
out
of
all
her
books
at
unlucky
moments
she
got
through
her
lessons
as
well
as
she
could
and
managed
to
escape
reprimands
by
being
a
model
of
deportment
she
was
a
great
favorite
with
her
mates
being
good-tempered
and
possessing
the
happy
art
of
pleasing
without
effort
her
little
airs
and
graces
were
much
admired
so
were
her
accomplishments
for
beside
her
drawing
she
could
play
twelve
tunes
crochet
and
read
french
without
mispronouncing
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
words
she
had
a
plaintive
way
of
saying
when
papa
was
rich
we
did
so-and-so
which
was
very
touching
and
her
long
words
were
considered
perfectly
elegant
by
the
girls
amy
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
spoilt
for
every
one
petted
her
and
her
small
vanities
and
selfishnesses
were
growing
nicely
one
thing
however
rather
quenched
the
vanities
she
had
to
wear
her
cousin's
clothes
now
florence's
mamma
hadn't
a
particle
of
taste
and
amy
suffered
deeply
at
having
to
wear
a
red
instead
of
a
blue
bonnet
unbecoming
gowns
and
fussy
aprons
that
did
not
fit
everything
was
good
well
made
and
little
worn
but
amy's
artistic
eyes
were
much
afflicted
especially
this
winter
when
her
school
dress
was
a
dull
purple
with
yellow
dots
and
no
trimming
my
only
comfort
she
said
to
meg
with
tears
in
her
eyes
is
that
mother
don't
take
tucks
in
my
dresses
whenever
i'm
naughty
as
maria
parks'
mother
does
my
dear
it's
really
dreadful
for
sometimes
she
is
so
bad
her
frock
is
up
to
her
knees
and
she
can't
come
to
school
when
i
think
of
this
_deggerredation_
i
feel
that
i
can
bear
even
my
flat
nose
and
purple
gown
with
yellow
sky-rockets
on
it
meg
was
amy's
confidant
and
monitor
and
by
some
strange
attraction
of
opposites
jo
was
gentle
beth's
to
jo
alone
did
the
shy
child
tell
her
thoughts
and
over
her
big
harum-scarum
sister
beth
unconsciously
exercised
more
influence
than
any
one
in
the
family
the
two
older
girls
were
a
great
deal
to
one
another
but
each
took
one
of
the
younger
into
her
keeping
and
watched
over
her
in
her
own
way
playing
mother
they
called
it
and
put
their
sisters
in
the
places
of
discarded
dolls
with
the
maternal
instinct
of
little
women
has
anybody
got
anything
to
tell
it's
been
such
a
dismal
day
i'm
really
dying
for
some
amusement
said
meg
as
they
sat
sewing
together
that
evening
i
had
a
queer
time
with
aunt
to-day
and
as
i
got
the
best
of
it
i'll
tell
you
about
it
began
jo
who
dearly
loved
to
tell
stories
i
was
reading
that
everlasting
belsham
and
droning
away
as
i
always
do
for
aunt
soon
drops
off
and
then
i
take
out
some
nice
book
and
read
like
fury
till
she
wakes
up
i
actually
made
myself
sleepy
and
before
she
began
to
nod
i
gave
such
a
gape
that
she
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
opening
my
mouth
wide
enough
to
take
the
whole
book
in
at
once
illustration
reading
that
everlasting
belsham
'i
wish
i
could
and
be
done
with
it,'
said
i
trying
not
to
be
saucy
then
she
gave
me
a
long
lecture
on
my
sins
and
told
me
to
sit
and
think
them
over
while
she
just
'lost'
herself
for
a
moment
she
never
finds
herself
very
soon
so
the
minute
her
cap
began
to
bob
like
a
top-heavy
dahlia
i
whipped
the
'vicar
of
wakefield'
out
of
my
pocket
and
read
away
with
one
eye
on
him
and
one
on
aunt
i'd
just
got
to
where
they
all
tumbled
into
the
water
when
i
forgot
and
laughed
out
loud
aunt
woke
up
and
being
more
good-natured
after
her
nap
told
me
to
read
a
bit
and
show
what
frivolous
work
i
preferred
to
the
worthy
and
instructive
belsham
i
did
my
very
best
and
she
liked
it
though
she
only
said,--
'i
don't
understand
what
it's
all
about
go
back
and
begin
it
child.'
back
i
went
and
made
the
primroses
as
interesting
as
ever
i
could
once
i
was
wicked
enough
to
stop
in
a
thrilling
place
and
say
meekly
'i'm
afraid
it
tires
you
ma'am
sha'n't
i
stop
now?'
she
caught
up
her
knitting
which
had
dropped
out
of
her
hands
gave
me
a
sharp
look
through
her
specs
and
said
in
her
short
way,--
'finish
the
chapter
and
don't
be
impertinent
miss.'
did
she
own
she
liked
it
asked
meg
oh
bless
you
no
but
she
let
old
belsham
rest
and
when
i
ran
back
after
my
gloves
this
afternoon
there
she
was
so
hard
at
the
vicar
that
she
didn't
hear
me
laugh
as
i
danced
a
jig
in
the
hall
because
of
the
good
time
coming
what
a
pleasant
life
she
might
have
if
she
only
chose
i
don't
envy
her
much
in
spite
of
her
money
for
after
all
rich
people
have
about
as
many
worries
as
poor
ones
i
think
added
jo
that
reminds
me
said
meg
that
i've
got
something
to
tell
it
isn't
funny
like
jo's
story
but
i
thought
about
it
a
good
deal
as
i
came
home
at
the
kings
to-day
i
found
everybody
in
a
flurry
and
one
of
the
children
said
that
her
oldest
brother
had
done
something
dreadful
and
papa
had
sent
him
away
i
heard
mrs
king
crying
and
mr
king
talking
very
loud
and
grace
and
ellen
turned
away
their
faces
when
they
passed
me
so
i
shouldn't
see
how
red
their
eyes
were
i
didn't
ask
any
questions
of
course
but
i
felt
so
sorry
for
them
and
was
rather
glad
i
hadn't
any
wild
brothers
to
do
wicked
things
and
disgrace
the
family
i
think
being
disgraced
in
school
is
a
great
deal
try_inger_
than
anything
bad
boys
can
do
said
amy
shaking
her
head
as
if
her
experience
of
life
had
been
a
deep
one
susie
perkins
came
to
school
to-day
with
a
lovely
red
carnelian
ring
i
wanted
it
dreadfully
and
wished
i
was
her
with
all
my
might
well
she
drew
a
picture
of
mr
davis
with
a
monstrous
nose
and
a
hump
and
the
words
'young
ladies
my
eye
is
upon
you!'
coming
out
of
his
mouth
in
a
balloon
thing
we
were
laughing
over
it
when
all
of
a
sudden
his
eye
_was_
on
us
and
he
ordered
susie
to
bring
up
her
slate
she
was
_parry_lized
with
fright
but
she
went
and
oh
what
_do_
you
think
he
did
he
took
her
by
the
ear
the
ear
just
fancy
how
horrid!--and
led
her
to
the
recitation
platform
and
made
her
stand
there
half
an
hour
holding
that
slate
so
every
one
could
see
illustration
he
took
her
by
the
ear
by
the
ear
didn't
the
girls
laugh
at
the
picture
asked
jo
who
relished
the
scrape
laugh
not
one
they
sat
as
still
as
mice
and
susie
cried
quarts
i
know
she
did
i
didn't
envy
her
then
for
i
felt
that
millions
of
carnelian
rings
wouldn't
have
made
me
happy
after
that
i
never
never
should
have
got
over
such
a
agonizing
mortification
and
amy
went
on
with
her
work
in
the
proud
consciousness
of
virtue
and
the
successful
utterance
of
two
long
words
in
a
breath
i
saw
something
that
i
liked
this
morning
and
i
meant
to
tell
it
at
dinner
but
i
forgot
said
beth
putting
jo's
topsy-turvy
basket
in
order
as
she
talked
when
i
went
to
get
some
oysters
for
hannah
mr
laurence
was
in
the
fish-shop
but
he
didn't
see
me
for
i
kept
behind
a
barrel
and
he
was
busy
with
mr
cutter
the
fish-man
a
poor
woman
came
in
with
a
pail
and
a
mop
and
asked
mr
cutter
if
he
would
let
her
do
some
scrubbing
for
a
bit
of
fish
because
she
hadn't
any
dinner
for
her
children
and
had
been
disappointed
of
a
day's
work
mr
cutter
was
in
a
hurry
and
said
'no,'
rather
crossly
so
she
was
going
away
looking
hungry
and
sorry
when
mr
laurence
hooked
up
a
big
fish
with
the
crooked
end
of
his
cane
and
held
it
out
to
her
she
was
so
glad
and
surprised
she
took
it
right
in
her
arms
and
thanked
him
over
and
over
he
told
her
to
'go
along
and
cook
it,'
and
she
hurried
off
so
happy
wasn't
it
good
of
him
oh
she
did
look
so
funny
hugging
the
big
slippery
fish
and
hoping
mr
laurence's
bed
in
heaven
would
be
'aisy.'
illustration
mr
laurence
hooked
up
a
big
fish
when
they
had
laughed
at
beth's
story
they
asked
their
mother
for
one
and
after
a
moment's
thought
she
said
soberly,--
as
i
sat
cutting
out
blue
flannel
jackets
to-day
at
the
rooms
i
felt
very
anxious
about
father
and
thought
how
lonely
and
helpless
we
should
be
if
anything
happened
to
him
it
was
not
a
wise
thing
to
do
but
i
kept
on
worrying
till
an
old
man
came
in
with
an
order
for
some
clothes
he
sat
down
near
me
and
i
began
to
talk
to
him
for
he
looked
poor
and
tired
and
anxious
'have
you
sons
in
the
army?'
i
asked
for
the
note
he
brought
was
not
to
me
'yes
ma'am
i
had
four
but
two
were
killed
one
is
a
prisoner
and
i'm
going
to
the
other
who
is
very
sick
in
a
washington
hospital,'
he
answered
quietly
'you
have
done
a
great
deal
for
your
country
sir,'
i
said
feeling
respect
now
instead
of
pity
'not
a
mite
more
than
i
ought
ma'am
i'd
go
myself
if
i
was
any
use
as
i
ain't
i
give
my
boys
and
give
'em
free.'
he
spoke
so
cheerfully
looked
so
sincere
and
seemed
so
glad
to
give
his
all
that
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
i'd
given
one
man
and
thought
it
too
much
while
he
gave
four
without
grudging
them
i
had
all
my
girls
to
comfort
me
at
home
and
his
last
son
was
waiting
miles
away
to
say
'good
by'
to
him
perhaps
i
felt
so
rich
so
happy
thinking
of
my
blessings
that
i
made
him
a
nice
bundle
gave
him
some
money
and
thanked
him
heartily
for
the
lesson
he
had
taught
me
tell
another
story
mother,--one
with
a
moral
to
it
like
this
i
like
to
think
about
them
afterwards
if
they
are
real
and
not
too
preachy
said
jo
after
a
minute's
silence
mrs
march
smiled
and
began
at
once
for
she
had
told
stories
to
this
little
audience
for
many
years
and
knew
how
to
please
them
once
upon
a
time
there
were
four
girls
who
had
enough
to
eat
and
drink
and
wear
a
good
many
comforts
and
pleasures
kind
friends
and
parents
who
loved
them
dearly
and
yet
they
were
not
contented
here
the
listeners
stole
sly
looks
at
one
another
and
began
to
sew
diligently
these
girls
were
anxious
to
be
good
and
made
many
excellent
resolutions
but
they
did
not
keep
them
very
well
and
were
constantly
saying
'if
we
only
had
this,'
or
'if
we
could
only
do
that,'
quite
forgetting
how
much
they
already
had
and
how
many
pleasant
things
they
actually
could
do
so
they
asked
an
old
woman
what
spell
they
could
use
to
make
them
happy
and
she
said
'when
you
feel
discontented
think
over
your
blessings
and
be
grateful.'
here
jo
looked
up
quickly
as
if
about
to
speak
but
changed
her
mind
seeing
that
the
story
was
not
done
yet
being
sensible
girls
they
decided
to
try
her
advice
and
soon
were
surprised
to
see
how
well
off
they
were
one
discovered
that
money
couldn't
keep
shame
and
sorrow
out
of
rich
people's
houses
another
that
though
she
was
poor
she
was
a
great
deal
happier
with
her
youth
health
and
good
spirits
than
a
certain
fretful
feeble
old
lady
who
couldn't
enjoy
her
comforts
a
third
that
disagreeable
as
it
was
to
help
get
dinner
it
was
harder
still
to
have
to
go
begging
for
it
and
the
fourth
that
even
carnelian
rings
were
not
so
valuable
as
good
behavior
so
they
agreed
to
stop
complaining
to
enjoy
the
blessings
already
possessed
and
try
to
deserve
them
lest
they
should
be
taken
away
entirely
instead
of
increased
and
i
believe
they
were
never
disappointed
or
sorry
that
they
took
the
old
woman's
advice
now
marmee
that
is
very
cunning
of
you
to
turn
our
own
stories
against
us
and
give
us
a
sermon
instead
of
a
romance
cried
meg
i
like
that
kind
of
sermon
it's
the
sort
father
used
to
tell
us
said
beth
thoughtfully
putting
the
needles
straight
on
jo's
cushion
i
don't
complain
near
as
much
as
the
others
do
and
i
shall
be
more
careful
than
ever
now
for
i've
had
warning
from
susie's
downfall
said
amy
morally
we
needed
that
lesson
and
we
won't
forget
it
if
we
do
you
just
say
to
us
as
old
chloe
did
in
'uncle
tom,'
'tink
ob
yer
marcies
chillen
tink
ob
yer
marcies!'
added
jo
who
could
not
for
the
life
of
her
help
getting
a
morsel
of
fun
out
of
the
little
sermon
though
she
took
it
to
heart
as
much
as
any
of
them

asked
meg
one
snowy
afternoon
as
her
sister
came
tramping
through
the
hall
in
rubber
boots
old
sack
and
hood
with
a
broom
in
one
hand
and
a
shovel
in

going

answered
jo
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
eyes
i
should
think
two
long
walks
this
morning
would
have
been
enough
it's
cold
and
dull
out
and
i
advise
you
to
stay
warm

dry
by

with

not

a

don't
like
to
doze

fire
i
like
adventures
and
i'm
going
to
find
some
meg
went
back
to
toast
her
feet
and
read
ivanhoe
and
jo
began
to
dig
paths
with
great
energy
the
snow
was
light
and
with
her
broom
she
soon
swept
a
path
all
round
the
garden
for
beth
to
walk
in
when
the
sun
came
out
and
the
invalid
dolls
needed
air
now
the
garden
separated
the
marches'
house
from
that
of
mr
laurence
both
stood
in
a
suburb
of
the
city
which
was
still
country-like
with
groves
and
lawns
large
gardens
and
quiet
streets
a
low
hedge
parted
the
two
estates
on
one
side
was
an
old
brown
house
looking
rather
bare
and
shabby
robbed
of
the
vines
that
in
summer
covered
its
walls
and
the
flowers
which
then
surrounded
it
on
the
other
side
was
a
stately
stone
mansion
plainly
betokening
every
sort
of
comfort
and
luxury
from
the
big
coach-house
and
well-kept
grounds
to
the
conservatory
and
the
glimpses
of
lovely
things
one
caught
between
the
rich
curtains
yet
it
seemed
a
lonely
lifeless
sort
of
house
for
no
children
frolicked
on
the
lawn
no
motherly
face
ever
smiled
at
the
windows
and
few
people
went
in
and
out
except
the
old
gentleman
and
his
grandson
to
jo's
lively
fancy
this
fine
house
seemed
a
kind
of
enchanted
palace
full
of
splendors
and
delights
which
no
one
enjoyed
she
had
long
wanted
to
behold
these
hidden
glories
and
to
know
the
laurence
boy
who
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
be
known
if
he
only
knew
how
to
begin
since
the
party
she
had
been
more
eager
than
ever
and
had
planned
many
ways
of
making
friends
with
him
but
he
had
not
been
seen
lately
and
jo
began
to
think
he
had
gone
away
when
she
one
day
spied
a
brown
face
at
an
upper
window
looking
wistfully
down
into
their
garden
where
beth
and
amy
were
snow-balling
one
another
that
boy
is
suffering
for
society
and
fun
she
said
to
herself
his
grandpa
does
not
know
what's
good
for
him
and
keeps
him
shut
up
all
alone
he
needs
a
party
of
jolly
boys
to
play
with
or
somebody
young
and
lively
i've
a
great
mind
to
go
over
and
tell
the
old
gentleman
so
the
idea
amused
jo
who
liked
to
do
daring
things
and
was
always
scandalizing
meg
by
her
queer
performances
the
plan
of
going
over
was
not
forgotten
and
when
the
snowy
afternoon
came
jo
resolved
to
try
what
could
be
done
she
saw
mr
laurence
drive
off
and
then
sallied
out
to
dig
her
way
down
to
the
hedge
where
she
paused
and
took
a
survey
all
quiet,--curtains
down
at
the
lower
windows
servants
out
of
sight
and
nothing
human
visible
but
a
curly
black
head
leaning
on
a
thin
hand
at
the
upper
window
there
he
is
thought
jo
poor
boy
all
alone
and
sick
this
dismal
day
it's
a
shame
i'll
toss
up
a
snow-ball
and
make
him
look
out
and
then
say
a
kind
word
to
him
up
went
a
handful
of
soft
snow
and
the
head
turned
at
once
showing
a
face
which
lost
its
listless
look
in
a
minute
as
the
big
eyes
brightened
and
the
mouth
began
to
smile
jo
nodded
and
laughed
and
flourished
her
broom
as
she
called
out,--
how
do
you
do
are
you
sick
illustration
laurie
opened
the
window
laurie
opened
the
window
and
croaked
out
as
hoarsely
as
a
raven,--

thank
you
i've
had
a
bad
cold
and
been
shut
up
a
week
i'm
sorry

won't

me
can't
somebody

you
grandpa

him
and
i
hate
to
ask

the
time

some
one
come
and
see
you
then
there
isn't
any
one
i'd
like
to

a
row
and
my
head
is

jo
then

and
stopped
so
i
do
will
you
come
please
cried
laurie
i'm
not
quiet
and
nice
but
i'll
come
if
mother
will
let
me
i'll
go
ask
her
shut
that
window
like
a
good
boy
and
wait
till
i
come
with
that
jo
shouldered
her
broom
and
marched
into
the
house
wondering
what
they
would
all
say
to
her
laurie
was
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
at
the
idea
of
having
company
and
flew
about
to
get
ready
for
as
mrs
march
said
he
was
a
little
gentleman
and
did
honor
to
the
coming
guest
by
brushing
his
curly
pate
putting
on
a
fresh
collar
and
trying
to
tidy
up
the
room
which
in
spite
of
half
a
dozen
servants
was
anything
but
neat
presently
there
came
a
loud
ring
then
a
decided
voice
asking
for
mr
laurie
and
a
surprised-looking
servant
came
running
up
to
announce
a
young
lady
all
right
show
her
up
it's
miss
jo
said
laurie
going
to
the
door
of
his
little
parlor
to
meet
jo
who
appeared
looking
rosy
and
kind
and
quite
at
her
ease
with
a
covered
dish
in
one
hand
and
beth's
three
kittens
in
the
other
here
i
am
bag
and
baggage
she
said
briskly
mother
sent
her
love
and
was
glad
if
i
could
do
anything
for
you
meg
wanted
me
to
bring
some
of
her
blanc-mange
she
makes
it
very
nicely
and
beth
thought
her
cats
would
be
comforting
i
knew
you'd
laugh
at
them
but
i
couldn't
refuse
she
was
so
anxious
to
do
something
it
so
happened
that
beth's
funny
loan
was
just
the
thing
for
in
laughing
over
the
kits
laurie
forgot
his
bashfulness
and
grew
sociable
at
once
that
looks
too
pretty
to
eat
he
said
smiling
with
pleasure
as
jo
uncovered
the
dish
and
showed
the
blanc-mange
surrounded
by
a
garland
of
green
leaves
and
the
scarlet
flowers
of
amy's
pet
geranium
it
isn't
anything
only
they
all
felt
kindly
and
wanted
to
show
it
tell
the
girl
to
put
it
away
for
your
tea
it's
so
simple
you
can
eat
it
and
being
soft
it
will
slip
down
without
hurting
your
sore
throat
what
a
cosy
room
this
is
it
might
be
if
it
was
kept
nice
but
the
maids
are
lazy
and
i
don't
know
how
to
make
them
mind
it
worries
me
though
i'll
right
it
up
in
two
minutes
for
it
only
needs
to
have
the
hearth
brushed
so,--and
the
things
made
straight
on
the
mantel-piece
so,--and
the
books
put
here
and
the
bottles
there
and
your
sofa
turned
from
the
light
and
the
pillows
plumped
up
a
bit
now
then
you're
fixed
and
so
he
was
for
as
she
laughed
and
talked
jo
had
whisked
things
into
place
and
given
quite
a
different
air
to
the
room
laurie
watched
her
in
respectful
silence
and
when
she
beckoned
him
to
his
sofa
he
sat
down
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
saying
gratefully,--
how
kind
you
are
yes
that's
what
it
wanted
now
please
take
the
big
chair
and
let
me
do
something
to
amuse
my
company
no
i
came
to
amuse
you
shall
i
read
aloud
and
jo
looked
affectionately
toward
some
inviting
books
near
by
thank
you
i've
read
all
those
and
if
you
don't
mind
i'd
rather
talk
answered
laurie
not
a
bit
i'll
talk
all
day
if
you'll
only
set
me
going
beth
says
i
never
know
when
to
stop
is
beth
the
rosy
one
who
stays
at
home
a
good
deal
and
sometimes
goes
out
with
a
little
basket
asked
laurie
with
interest
yes
that's
beth
she's
my
girl
and
a
regular
good
one
she
is
too
the
pretty
one
is
meg
and
the
curly-haired
one
is
amy
i
believe
how
did
you
find
that
out
laurie
colored
up
but
answered
frankly
why
you
see
i
often
hear
you
calling
to
one
another
and
when
i'm
alone
up
here
i
can't
help
looking
over
at
your
house
you
always
seem
to
be
having
such
good
times
i
beg
your
pardon
for
being
so
rude
but
sometimes
you
forget
to
put
down
the
curtain
at
the
window
where
the
flowers
are
and
when
the
lamps
are
lighted
it's
like
looking
at
a
picture
to
see
the
fire
and
you
all
round
the
table
with
your
mother
her
face
is
right
opposite
and
it
looks
so
sweet
behind
the
flowers
i
can't
help
watching
it
i
haven't
got
any
mother
you
know
and
laurie
poked
the
fire
to
hide
a
little
twitching
of
the
lips
that
he
could
not
control
the
solitary
hungry
look
in
his
eyes
went
straight
to
jo's
warm
heart
she
had
been
so
simply
taught
that
there
was
no
nonsense
in
her
head
and
at
fifteen
she
was
as
innocent
and
frank
as
any
child
laurie
was
sick
and
lonely
and
feeling
how
rich
she
was
in
home-love
and
happiness
she
gladly
tried
to
share
it
with
him
her
face
was
very
friendly
and
her
sharp
voice
unusually
gentle
as
she
said,--
we'll
never
draw
that
curtain
any
more
and
i
give
you
leave
to
look
as
much
as
you
like
i
just
wish
though
instead
of
peeping
you'd
come
over
and
see
us
mother
is
so
splendid
she'd
do
you
heaps
of
good
and
beth
would
sing
to
you
if
_i_
begged
her
to
and
amy
would
dance
meg
and
i
would
make
you
laugh
over
our
funny
stage
properties
and
we'd
have
jolly
times
wouldn't
your
grandpa
let
you
i
think
he
would
if
your
mother
asked
him
he's
very
kind
though
he
does
not
look
so
and
he
lets
me
do
what
i
like
pretty
much
only
he's
afraid
i
might
be
a
bother
to
strangers
began
laurie
brightening
more
and
more
we
are
not
strangers
we
are
neighbors
and
you
needn't
think
you'd
be
a
bother
we
_want_
to
know
you
and
i've
been
trying
to
do
it
this
ever
so
long
we
haven't
been
here
a
great
while
you
know
but
we
have
got
acquainted
with
all
our
neighbors
but
you
you
see
grandpa
lives
among
his
books
and
doesn't
mind
much
what
happens
outside
mr
brooke
my
tutor
doesn't
stay
here
you
know
and
i
have
no
one
to
go
about
with
me
so
i
just
stop
at
home
and
get
on
as
i
can
that's
bad
you
ought
to
make
an
effort
and
go
visiting
everywhere
you
are
asked
then
you'll
have
plenty
of
friends
and
pleasant
places
to
go
to
never
mind
being
bashful
it
won't
last
long
if
you
keep
going
laurie
turned
red
again
but
wasn't
offended
at
being
accused
of
bashfulness
for
there
was
so
much
good-will
in
jo
it
was
impossible
not
to
take
her
blunt
speeches
as
kindly
as
they
were
meant
do
you
like
your
school
asked
the
boy
changing
the
subject
after
a
little
pause
during
which
he
stared
at
the
fire
and
jo
looked
about
her
well
pleased
don't
go
to
school
i'm
a
business
man--girl
i
mean
i
go
to
wait
on
my
great-aunt
and
a
dear
cross
old
soul
she
is
too
answered
jo
laurie
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
another
question
but
remembering
just
in
time
that
it
wasn't
manners
to
make
too
many
inquiries
into
people's
affairs
he
shut
it
again
and
looked
uncomfortable
jo
liked
his
good
breeding
and
didn't
mind
having
a
laugh
at
aunt
march
so
she
gave
him
a
lively
description
of
the
fidgety
old
lady
her
fat
poodle
the
parrot
that
talked
spanish
and
the
library
where
she
revelled
laurie
enjoyed
that
immensely
and
when
she
told
about
the
prim
old
gentleman
who
came
once
to
woo
aunt
march
and
in
the
middle
of
a
fine
speech
how
poll
had
tweaked
his
wig
off
to
his
great
dismay
the
boy
lay
back
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
a
maid
popped
her
head
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
illustration
poll
tweaked
off
his
wig
oh
that
does
me
no
end
of
good
tell
on
please
he
said
taking
his
face
out
of
the
sofa-cushion
red
and
shining
with
merriment
much
elated
with
her
success
jo
did
tell
on
all
about
their
plays
and
plans
their
hopes
and
fears
for
father
and
the
most
interesting
events
of
the
little
world
in
which
the
sisters
lived
then
they
got
to
talking
about
books
and
to
jo's
delight
she
found
that
laurie
loved
them
as
well
as
she
did
and
had
read
even
more
than
herself
if
you
like
them
so
much
come
down
and
see
ours
grandpa
is
out
so
you
needn't
be
afraid
said
laurie
getting
up
i'm
not
afraid
of
anything
returned
jo
with
a
toss
of
the
head
i
don't
believe
you
are
exclaimed
the
boy
looking
at
her
with
much
admiration
though
he
privately
thought
she
would
have
good
reason
to
be
a
trifle
afraid
of
the
old
gentleman
if
she
met
him
in
some
of
his
moods
the
atmosphere
of
the
whole
house
being
summer-like
laurie
led
the
way
from
room
to
room
letting
jo
stop
to
examine
whatever
struck
her
fancy
and
so
at
last
they
came
to
the
library
where
she
clapped
her
hands
and
pranced
as
she
always
did
when
especially
delighted
it
was
lined
with
books
and
there
were
pictures
and
statues
and
distracting
little
cabinets
full
of
coins
and
curiosities
and
sleepy-hollow
chairs
and
queer
tables
and
bronzes
and
best
of
all
a
great
open
fireplace
with
quaint
tiles
all
round
it
what
richness
sighed
jo
sinking
into
the
depth
of
a
velvet
chair
and
gazing
about
her
with
an
air
of
intense
satisfaction
theodore
laurence
you
ought
to
be
the
happiest
boy
in
the
world
she
added
impressively
a
fellow
can't
live
on
books
said
laurie
shaking
his
head
as
he
perched
on
a
table
opposite
before
he
could
say
more
a
bell
rung
and
jo
flew
up
exclaiming
with
alarm
mercy
me
it's
your
grandpa
well
what
if
it
is
you
are
not
afraid
of
anything
you
know
returned
the
boy
looking
wicked
i
think
i
am
a
little
bit
afraid
of
him
but
i
don't
know
why
i
should
be
marmee
said
i
might
come
and
i
don't
think
you're
any
the
worse
for
it
said
jo
composing
herself
though
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
door
i'm
a
great
deal
better
for
it
and
ever
so
much
obliged
i'm
only
afraid
you
are
very
tired
talking
to
me
it
was
_so_
pleasant
i
couldn't
bear
to
stop
said
laurie
gratefully
the
doctor
to
see
you
sir
and
the
maid
beckoned
as
she
spoke
would
you
mind
if
i
left
you
for
a
minute
i
suppose
i
must
see
him
said
laurie
don't
mind
me
i'm
as
happy
as
a
cricket
here
answered
jo
laurie
went
away
and
his
guest
amused
herself
in
her
own
way
she
was
standing
before
a
fine
portrait
of
the
old
gentleman
when
the
door
opened
again
and
without
turning
she
said
decidedly
i'm
sure
now
that
i
shouldn't
be
afraid
of
him
for
he's
got
kind
eyes
though
his
mouth
is
grim
and
he
looks
as
if
he
had
a
tremendous
will
of
his
own
he
isn't
as
handsome
as
_my_
grandfather
but
i
like
him
thank
you
ma'am
said
a
gruff
voice
behind
her
and
there
to
her
great
dismay
stood
old
mr
laurence
poor
jo
blushed
till
she
couldn't
blush
any
redder
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
uncomfortably
fast
as
she
thought
what
she
had
said
for
a
minute
a
wild
desire
to
run
away
possessed
her
but
that
was
cowardly
and
the
girls
would
laugh
at
her
so
she
resolved
to
stay
and
get
out
of
the
scrape
as
she
could
a
second
look
showed
her
that
the
living
eyes
under
the
bushy
gray
eyebrows
were
kinder
even
than
the
painted
ones
and
there
was
a
sly
twinkle
in
them
which
lessened
her
fear
a
good
deal
the
gruff
voice
was
gruffer
than
ever
as
the
old
gentleman
said
abruptly
after
that
dreadful
pause
so
you're
not
afraid
of
me
hey
not
much
sir
and
you
don't
think
me
as
handsome
as
your
grandfather
not
quite
sir
and
i've
got
a
tremendous
will
have
i
i
only
said
i
thought
so
but
you
like
me
in
spite
of
it
yes
i
do
sir
that
answer
pleased
the
old
gentleman
he
gave
a
short
laugh
shook
hands
with
her
and
putting
his
finger
under
her
chin
turned
up
her
face
examined
it
gravely
and
let
it
go
saying
with
a
nod
you've
got
your
grandfather's
spirit
if
you
haven't
his
face
he
_was_
a
fine
man
my
dear
but
what
is
better
he
was
a
brave
and
an
honest
one
and
i
was
proud
to
be
his
friend
illustration
putting
his
finger
under
her
chin
thank
you
sir
and
jo
was
quite
comfortable
after
that
for
it
suited
her
exactly
what
have
you
been
doing
to
this
boy
of
mine
hey
was
the
next
question
sharply
put
only
trying
to
be
neighborly
sir
and
jo
told
how
her
visit
came
about
you
think
he
needs
cheering
up
a
bit
do
you
yes
sir
he
seems
a
little
lonely
and
young
folks
would
do
him
good
perhaps
we
are
only
girls
but
we
should
be
glad
to
help
if
we
could
for
we
don't
forget
the
splendid
christmas
present
you
sent
us
said
jo
eagerly
tut
tut
tut
that
was
the
boy's
affair
how
is
the
poor
woman
doing
nicely
sir
and
off
went
jo
talking
very
fast
as
she
told
all
about
the
hummels
in
whom
her
mother
had
interested
richer
friends
than
they
were
just
her
father's
way
of
doing
good
i
shall
come
and
see
your
mother
some
fine
day
tell
her
so
there's
the
tea-bell
we
have
it
early
on
the
boy's
account
come
down
and
go
on
being
neighborly
if
you'd
like
to
have
me
sir
shouldn't
ask
you
if
i
didn't
and
mr
laurence
offered
her
his
arm
with
old-fashioned
courtesy
what
_would_
meg
say
to
this
thought
jo
as
she
was
marched
away
while
her
eyes
danced
with
fun
as
she
imagined
herself
telling
the
story
at
home
hey
why
what
the
dickens
has
come
to
the
fellow
said
the
old
gentleman
as
laurie
came
running
down
stairs
and
brought
up
with
a
start
of
surprise
at
the
astonishing
sight
of
jo
arm-in-arm
with
his
redoubtable
grandfather
i
didn't
know
you'd
come
sir
he
began
as
jo
gave
him
a
triumphant
little
glance
that's
evident
by
the
way
you
racket
down
stairs
come
to
your
tea
sir
and
behave
like
a
gentleman
and
having
pulled
the
boy's
hair
by
way
of
a
caress
mr
laurence
walked
on
while
laurie
went
through
a
series
of
comic
evolutions
behind
their
backs
which
nearly
produced
an
explosion
of
laughter
from
jo
the
old
gentleman
did
not
say
much
as
he
drank
his
four
cups
of
tea
but
he
watched
the
young
people
who
soon
chatted
away
like
old
friends
and
the
change
in
his
grandson
did
not
escape
him
there
was
color
light
and
life
in
the
boy's
face
now
vivacity
in
his
manner
and
genuine
merriment
in
his
laugh
she's
right
the
lad
_is_
lonely
i'll
see
what
these
little
girls
can
do
for
him
thought
mr
laurence
as
he
looked
and
listened
he
liked
jo
for
her
odd
blunt
ways
suited
him
and
she
seemed
to
understand
the
boy
almost
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
one
herself
if
the
laurences
had
been
what
jo
called
prim
and
poky
she
would
not
have
got
on
at
all
for
such
people
always
made
her
shy
and
awkward
but
finding
them
free
and
easy
she
was
so
herself
and
made
a
good
impression
when
they
rose
she
proposed
to
go
but
laurie
said
he
had
something
more
to
show
her
and
took
her
away
to
the
conservatory
which
had
been
lighted
for
her
benefit
it
seemed
quite
fairylike
to
jo
as
she
went
up
and
down
the
walks
enjoying
the
blooming
walls
on
either
side
the
soft
light
the
damp
sweet
air
and
the
wonderful
vines
and
trees
that
hung
above
her,--while
her
new
friend
cut
the
finest
flowers
till
his
hands
were
full
then
he
tied
them
up
saying
with
the
happy
look
jo
liked
to
see
please
give
these
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
i
like
the
medicine
she
sent
me
very
much
illustration
please
give
these
to
your
mother
they
found
mr
laurence
standing
before
the
fire
in
the
great
drawing-room
but
jo's
attention
was
entirely
absorbed
by
a
grand
piano
which
stood
open
do
you
play
she
asked
turning
to
laurie
with
a
respectful
expression
sometimes
he
answered
modestly
please
do
now
i
want
to
hear
it
so
i
can
tell
beth
won't
you
first
don't
know
how
too
stupid
to
learn
but
i
love
music
dearly
so
laurie
played
and
jo
listened
with
her
nose
luxuriously
buried
in
heliotrope
and
tea-roses
her
respect
and
regard
for
the
laurence
boy
increased
very
much
for
he
played
remarkably
well
and
didn't
put
on
any
airs
she
wished
beth
could
hear
him
but
she
did
not
say
so
only
praised
him
till
he
was
quite
abashed
and
his
grandfather
came
to
the
rescue
that

do
that
will
do
young
lady
too
many
sugar-plums
are
not
good
for
him
his
music

bad
but

hope

well
in
more
important
things

i'm
much
obliged
to

and
i
hope
you'll
come

my
respects
to
your
mother
good-night
doctor
jo
he
shook
hands
kindly
but
looked
as
if
something
did
not
please
him
when
they
got
into
the
hall
jo
asked
laurie
if
she
had
said
anything
amiss
he
shook
his
head
no
it
was
me
he
doesn't
like
to
hear

play
why
not
i'll
tell
you
some
day
john
is
going
home
with
you
as
i
can't
no
need
of
that
i
am
not
a
young
lady
and
it's
only
a
step
take
care
of
yourself
won't
you
yes
but
you
will
come
again
i
hope
if
you
promise
to
come
and
see
us
after
you
are
well
i
will
good-night
laurie
good-night
jo
good-night
when
all
the
afternoon's
adventures
had
been
told
the
family
felt
inclined
to
go
visiting
in
a
body
for
each
found
something
very
attractive
in
the
big
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
mrs
march
wanted
to
talk
of
her
father
with
the
old
man
who
had
not
forgotten
him
meg
longed
to
walk
in
the
conservatory
beth
sighed
for
the
grand
piano
and
amy
was
eager
to
see
the
fine
pictures
and
statues
mother
why
didn't
mr
laurence
like
to
have
laurie
play
asked
jo
who
was
of
an
inquiring
disposition
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
it
was
because
his
son
laurie's
father
married
an
italian
lady
a
musician
which
displeased
the
old
man
who
is
very
proud
the
lady
was
good
and
lovely
and
accomplished
but
he
did
not
like
her
and
never
saw
his
son
after
he
married
they
both
died
when
laurie
was
a
little
child
and
then
his
grandfather
took
him
home
i
fancy
the
boy
who
was
born
in
italy
is
not
very
strong
and
the
old
man
is
afraid
of
losing
him
which
makes
him
so
careful
laurie
comes
naturally
by
his
love
of
music
for
he
is
like
his
mother
and
i
dare
say
his
grandfather
fears
that
he
may
want
to
be
a
musician
at
any
rate
his
skill
reminds
him
of
the
woman
he
did
not
like
and
so
he
'glowered,'
as
jo
said
dear
me
how
romantic
exclaimed
meg
how
silly
said
jo
let
him
be
a
musician
if
he
wants
to
and
not
plague
his
life
out
sending
him
to
college
when
he
hates
to
go
that's
why
he
has
such
handsome
black
eyes
and
pretty
manners
i
suppose
italians
are
always
nice
said
meg
who
was
a
little
sentimental
what
do
you
know
about
his
eyes
and
his
manners
you
never
spoke
to
him
hardly
cried
jo
who
was
_not_
sentimental
i
saw
him
at
the
party
and
what
you
tell
shows
that
he
knows
how
to
behave
that
was
a
nice
little
speech
about
the
medicine
mother
sent
him
he
meant
the
blanc-mange
i
suppose
how
stupid
you
are
child
he
meant
you
of
course
did
he
and
jo
opened
her
eyes
as
if
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
i
never
saw
such
a
girl
you
don't
know
a
compliment
when
you
get
it
said
meg
with
the
air
of
a
young
lady
who
knew
all
about
the
matter
i
think
they
are
great
nonsense
and
i'll
thank
you
not
to
be
silly
and
spoil
my
fun
laurie's
a
nice
boy
and
i
like
him
and
i
won't
have
any
sentimental
stuff
about
compliments
and
such
rubbish
we'll
all
be
good
to
him
because
he
hasn't
got
any
mother
and
he
_may_
come
over
and
see
us
mayn't
he
marmee
yes
jo
your
little
friend
is
very
welcome
and
i
hope
meg
will
remember
that
children
should
be
children
as
long
as
they
can
i
don't
call
myself
a
child
and
i'm
not
in
my
teens
yet
observed
amy
what
do
you
say
beth
i
was
thinking
about
our
'pilgrim's
progress,'
answered
beth
who
had
not
heard
a
word
how
we
got
out
of
the
slough
and
through
the
wicket
gate
by
resolving
to
be
good
and
up
the
steep
hill
by
trying
and
that
maybe
the
house
over
there
full
of
splendid
things
is
going
to
be
our
palace
beautiful
we
have
got
to
get
by
the
lions
first
said
jo
as
if
she
rather
liked
the
prospect
illustration
tail-piece
vi
beth
finds
the
palace
beautiful
the
big
house
did
prove
a
palace
beautiful
though
it
took
some
time
for
all
to
get
in
and
beth
found
it
very
hard
to
pass
the
lions
old
mr
laurence
was
the
biggest
one
but
after
he
had
called
said
something
funny
or
kind
to
each
one
of
the
girls
and
talked
over
old
times
with
their
mother
nobody
felt
much
afraid
of
him
except
timid
beth
the
other
lion
was
the
fact
that
they
were
poor
and
laurie
rich
for
this
made
them
shy
of
accepting
favors
which
they
could
not
return
but
after
a
while
they
found
that
he
considered
them
the
benefactors
and
could
not
do
enough
to
show
how
grateful
he
was
for
mrs
march's
motherly
welcome
their
cheerful
society
and
the
comfort
he
took
in
that
humble
home
of
theirs
so
they
soon
forgot
their
pride
and
interchanged
kindnesses
without
stopping
to
think
which
was
the
greater
all
sorts
of
pleasant
things
happened
about
that
time
for
the
new
friendship
flourished
like
grass
in
spring
every
one
liked
laurie
and
he
privately
informed
his
tutor
that
the
marches
were
regularly
splendid
girls
with
the
delightful
enthusiasm
of
youth
they
took
the
solitary
boy
into
their
midst
and
made
much
of
him
and
he
found
something
very
charming
in
the
innocent
companionship
of
these
simple-hearted
girls
never
having
known
mother
or
sisters
he
was
quick
to
feel
the
influences
they
brought
about
him
and
their
busy
lively
ways
made
him
ashamed
of
the
indolent
life
he
led
he
was
tired
of
books
and
found
people
so
interesting
now
that
mr
brooke
was
obliged
to
make
very
unsatisfactory
reports
for
laurie
was
always
playing
truant
and
running
over
to
the
marches
never
mind
let
him
take
a
holiday
and
make
it
up
afterwards
said
the
old
gentleman
the
good
lady
next
door
says
he
is
studying
too
hard
and
needs
young
society
amusement
and
exercise
i
suspect
she
is
right
and
that
i've
been
coddling
the
fellow
as
if
i'd
been
his
grandmother
let
him
do
what
he
likes
as
long
as
he
is
happy
he
can't
get
into
mischief
in
that
little
nunnery
over
there
and
mrs
march
is
doing
more
for
him
than
we
can
what
good
times
they
had
to
be
sure
such
plays
and
tableaux
such
sleigh-rides
and
skating
frolics
such
pleasant
evenings
in
the
old
parlor
and
now
and
then
such
gay
little
parties
at
the
great
house
meg
could
walk
in
the
conservatory
whenever
she
liked
and
revel
in
bouquets
jo
browsed
over
the
new
library
voraciously
and
convulsed
the
old
gentleman
with
her
criticisms
amy
copied
pictures
and
enjoyed
beauty
to
her
heart's
content
and
laurie
played
lord
of
the
manor
in
the
most
delightful
style
but
beth
though
yearning
for
the
grand
piano
could
not
pluck
up
courage
to
go
to
the
mansion
of
bliss
as
meg
called
it
she
went
once
with
jo
but
the
old
gentleman
not
being
aware
of
her
infirmity
stared
at
her
so
hard
from
under
his
heavy
eyebrows
and
said
hey
so
loud
that
he
frightened
her
so
much
her
feet
chattered
on
the
floor
she
told
her
mother
and
she
ran
away
declaring
she
would
never
go
there
any
more
not
even
for
the
dear
piano
no
persuasions
or
enticements
could
overcome
her
fear
till
the
fact
coming
to
mr
laurence's
ear
in
some
mysterious
way
he
set
about
mending
matters
during
one
of
the
brief
calls
he
made
he
artfully
led
the
conversation
to
music
and
talked
away
about
great
singers
whom
he
had
seen
fine
organs
he
had
heard
and
told
such
charming
anecdotes
that
beth
found
it
impossible
to
stay
in
her
distant
corner
but
crept
nearer
and
nearer
as
if
fascinated
at
the
back
of
his
chair
she
stopped
and
stood
listening
with
her
great
eyes
wide
open
and
her
cheeks
red
with
the
excitement
of
this
unusual
performance
taking
no
more
notice
of
her
than
if
she
had
been
a
fly
mr
laurence
talked
on
about
laurie's
lessons
and
teachers
and
presently
as
if
the
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
he
said
to
mrs
march,--
the
boy
neglects
his
music
now
and
i'm
glad
of
it
for
he
was
getting
too
fond
of
it
but
the
piano
suffers
for
want
of
use
wouldn't
some
of
your
girls
like
to
run
over
and
practise
on
it
now
and
then
just
to
keep
it
in
tune
you
know
ma'am
beth
took
a
step
forward
and
pressed
her
hands
tightly
together
to
keep
from
clapping
them
for
this
was
an
irresistible
temptation
and
the
thought
of
practising
on
that
splendid
instrument
quite
took
her
breath
away
before
mrs
march
could
reply
mr
laurence
went
on
with
an
odd
little
nod
and
smile,--
they
needn't
see
or
speak
to
any
one
but
run
in
at
any
time
for
i'm
shut
up
in
my
study
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
laurie
is
out
a
great
deal
and
the
servants
are
never
near
the
drawing-room
after
nine
o'clock
here
he
rose
as
if
going
and
beth
made
up
her
mind
to
speak
for
that
last
arrangement
left
nothing
to
be
desired
please
tell
the
young
ladies
what
i
say
and
if
they
don't
care
to
come
why
never
mind
here
a
little
hand
slipped
into
his
and
beth
looked
up
at
him
with
a
face
full
of
gratitude
as
she
said
in
her
earnest
yet
timid
way,--
o
sir
they
do
care
very
very
much
illustration
o
sir
they
do
care
very
much
are
you
the
musical
girl
he
asked
without
any
startling
hey
as
he
looked
down
at
her
very
kindly
i'm
beth
i
love
it
dearly
and
i'll
come
if
you
are
quite
sure
nobody
will
hear
me--and
be
disturbed
she
added
fearing
to
be
rude
and
trembling
at
her
own
boldness
as
she
spoke
not
a
soul
my
dear
the
house
is
empty
half
the
day
so
come
and
drum
away
as
much
as
you
like
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
how
kind
you
are
sir
beth
blushed
like
a
rose
under
the
friendly
look
he
wore
but
she
was
not
frightened
now
and
gave
the
big
hand
a
grateful
squeeze
because
she
had
no
words
to
thank
him
for
the
precious
gift
he
had
given
her
the
old
gentleman
softly
stroked
the
hair
off
her
forehead
and
stooping
down
he
kissed
her
saying
in
a
tone
few
people
ever
heard,--
i
had
a
little
girl
once
with
eyes
like
these
god
bless
you
my
dear
good
day
madam
and
away
he
went
in
a
great
hurry
beth
had
a
rapture
with
her
mother
and
then
rushed
up
to
impart
the
glorious
news
to
her
family
of
invalids
as
the
girls
were
not
at
home
how
blithely
she
sung
that
evening
and
how
they
all
laughed
at
her
because
she
woke
amy
in
the
night
by
playing
the
piano
on
her
face
in
her
sleep
next
day
having
seen
both
the
old
and
young
gentleman
out
of
the
house
beth
after
two
or
three
retreats
fairly
got
in
at
the
side-door
and
made
her
way
as
noiselessly
as
any
mouse
to
the
drawing-room
where
her
idol
stood
quite
by
accident
of
course
some
pretty
easy
music
lay
on
the
piano
and
with
trembling
fingers
and
frequent
stops
to
listen
and
look
about
beth
at
last
touched
the
great
instrument
and
straightway
forgot
her
fear
herself
and
everything
else
but
the
unspeakable
delight
which
the
music
gave
her
for
it
was
like
the
voice
of
a
beloved
friend
she
stayed
till
hannah
came
to
take
her
home
to
dinner
but
she
had
no
appetite
and
could
only
sit
and
smile
upon
every
one
in
a
general
state
of
beatitude
after
that
the
little
brown
hood
slipped
through
the
hedge
nearly
every
day
and
the
great
drawing-room
was
haunted
by
a
tuneful
spirit
that
came
and
went
unseen
she
never
knew
that
mr
laurence
often
opened
his
study-door
to
hear
the
old-fashioned
airs
he
liked
she
never
saw
laurie
mount
guard
in
the
hall
to
warn
the
servants
away
she
never
suspected
that
the
exercise-books
and
new
songs
which
she
found
in
the
rack
were
put
there
for
her
especial
benefit
and
when
he
talked
to
her
about
music
at
home
she
only
thought
how
kind
he
was
to
tell
things
that
helped
her
so
much
so
she
enjoyed
herself
heartily
and
found
what
isn't
always
the
case
that
her
granted
wish
was
all
she
had
hoped
perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
so
grateful
for
this
blessing
that
a
greater
was
given
her
at
any
rate
she
deserved
both
illustration
mr
laurence
often
opened
his
study
door
mother
i'm
going
to
work
mr
laurence
a
pair
of
slippers
he
is
so
kind
to
me
i
must
thank
him
and
i
don't
know
any
other
way
can
i
do
it
asked
beth
a
few
weeks
after
that
eventful
call
of
his
yes
dear
it
will
please
him
very
much
and
be
a
nice
way
of
thanking
him
the
girls
will
help
you
about
them
and
i
will
pay
for
the
making
up
replied
mrs
march
who
took
peculiar
pleasure
in
granting
beth's
requests
because
she
so
seldom
asked
anything
for
herself
after
many
serious
discussions
with
meg
and
jo
the
pattern
was
chosen
the
materials
bought
and
the
slippers
begun
a
cluster
of
grave
yet
cheerful
pansies
on
a
deeper
purple
ground
was
pronounced
very
appropriate
and
pretty
and
beth
worked
away
early
and
late
with
occasional
lifts
over
hard
parts
she
was
a
nimble
little
needle-woman
and
they
were
finished
before
any
one
got
tired
of
them
then
she
wrote
a
very
short
simple
note
and
with
laurie's
help
got
them
smuggled
on
to
the
study-table
one
morning
before
the
old
gentleman
was
up
when
this
excitement
was
over
beth
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
all
that
day
passed
and
a
part
of
the
next
before
any
acknowledgment
arrived
and
she
was
beginning
to
fear
she
had
offended
her
crotchety
friend
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
she
went
out
to
do
an
errand
and
give
poor
joanna
the
invalid
doll
her
daily
exercise
as
she
came
up
the
street
on
her
return
she
saw
three
yes
four
heads
popping
in
and
out
of
the
parlor
windows
and
the
moment
they
saw
her
several
hands
were
waved
and
several
joyful
voices
screamed,--
here's
a
letter
from
the
old
gentleman
come
quick
and
read
it
o
beth
he's
sent
you--
began
amy
gesticulating
with
unseemly
energy
but
she
got
no
further
for
jo
quenched
her
by
slamming
down
the
window
beth
hurried
on
in
a
flutter
of
suspense
at
the
door
her
sisters
seized
and
bore
her
to
the
parlor
in
a
triumphal
procession
all
pointing
and
all
saying
at
once
look
there
look
there
beth
did
look
and
turned
pale
with
delight
and
surprise
for
there
stood
a
little
cabinet-piano
with
a
letter
lying
on
the
glossy
lid
directed
like
a
sign-board
to
miss
elizabeth
march
for
me
gasped
beth
holding
on
to
jo
and
feeling
as
if
she
should
tumble
down
it
was
such
an
overwhelming
thing
altogether
yes
all
for
you
my
precious
isn't
it
splendid
of
him
don't
you
think
he's
the
dearest
old
man
in
the
world
here's
the
key
in
the
letter
we
didn't
open
it
but
we
are
dying
to
know
what
he
says
cried
jo
hugging
her
sister
and
offering
the
note
you
read
it
i
can't
i
feel
so
queer
oh
it
is
too
lovely
and
beth
hid
her
face
in
jo's
apron
quite
upset
by
her
present
jo
opened
the
paper
and
began
to
laugh
for
the
first
words
she
saw
were,--
miss
march
_dear
madam_,--
how
nice
it
sounds
i
wish
some
one
would
write
to
me
so
said
amy
who
thought
the
old-fashioned
address
very
elegant
'i
have
had
many
pairs
of
slippers
in
my
life
but
i
never
had
any
that
suited
me
so
well
as
yours,'
continued
jo
'heart's-ease
is
my
favorite
flower
and
these
will
always
remind
me
of
the
gentle
giver
i
like
to
pay
my
debts
so
i
know
you
will
allow
the
old
gentleman
to
send
you
something
which
once
belonged
to
the
little
granddaughter
he
lost
with
hearty
thanks
and
best
wishes
i
remain
'your
grateful
friend
and
humble
servant
'james
laurence.'
there
beth
that's
an
honor
to
be
proud
of
i'm
sure
laurie
told
me
how
fond
mr
laurence
used
to
be
of
the
child
who
died
and
how
he
kept
all
her
little
things
carefully
just
think
he's
given
you
her
piano
that
comes
of
having
big
blue
eyes
and
loving
music
said
jo
trying
to
soothe
beth
who
trembled
and
looked
more
excited
than
she
had
ever
been
before
see
the
cunning
brackets
to
hold
candles
and
the
nice
green
silk
puckered
up
with
a
gold
rose
in
the
middle
and
the
pretty
rack
and
stool
all
complete
added
meg
opening
the
instrument
and
displaying
its
beauties
'your
humble
servant
james
laurence'
only
think
of
his
writing
that
to
you
i'll
tell
the
girls
they'll
think
it's
splendid
said
amy
much
impressed
by
the
note
try
it
honey
let's
hear
the
sound
of
the
baby-pianny
said
hannah
who
always
took
a
share
in
the
family
joys
and
sorrows
so
beth
tried
it
and
every
one
pronounced
it
the
most
remarkable
piano
ever
heard
it
had
evidently
been
newly
tuned
and
put
in
apple-pie
order
but
perfect
as
it
was
i
think
the
real
charm
of
it
lay
in
the
happiest
of
all
happy
faces
which
leaned
over
it
as
beth
lovingly
touched
the
beautiful
black
and
white
keys
and
pressed
the
bright
pedals
you'll
have
to
go
and
thank
him
said
jo
by
way
of
a
joke
for
the
idea
of
the
child's
really
going
never
entered
her
head
yes
i
mean
to
i
guess
i'll
go
now
before
i
get
frightened
thinking
about
it
and
to
the
utter
amazement
of
the
assembled
family
beth
walked
deliberately
down
the
garden
through
the
hedge
and
in
at
the
laurences'
door
well
i
wish
i
may
die
if
it
ain't
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
see
the
pianny
has
turned
her
head
she'd
never
have
gone
in
her
right
mind
cried
hannah
staring
after
her
while
the
girls
were
rendered
quite
speechless
by
the
miracle
they
would
have
been
still
more
amazed
if
they
had
seen
what
beth
did
afterward
if
you
will
believe
me
she
went
and
knocked
at
the
study-door
before
she
gave
herself
time
to
think
and
when
a
gruff
voice
called
out
come
in
she
did
go
in
right
up
to
mr
laurence
who
looked
quite
taken
aback
and
held
out
her
hand
saying
with
only
a
small
quaver
in
her
voice
i
came
to
thank
you
sir
for--
but
she
didn't
finish
for
he
looked
so
friendly
that
she
forgot
her
speech
and
only
remembering
that
he
had
lost
the
little
girl
he
loved
she
put
both
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
illustration
she
put
both
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
if
the
roof
of
the
house
had
suddenly
flown
off
the
old
gentleman
wouldn't
have
been
more
astonished
but
he
liked
it,--oh
dear
yes
he
liked
it
amazingly!--and
was
so
touched
and
pleased
by
that
confiding
little
kiss
that
all
his
crustiness
vanished
and
he
just
set
her
on
his
knee
and
laid
his
wrinkled
cheek
against
her
rosy
one
feeling
as
if
he
had
got
his
own
little
granddaughter
back
again
beth
ceased
to
fear
him
from
that
moment
and
sat
there
talking
to
him
as
cosily
as
if
she
had
known
him
all
her
life
for
love
casts
out
fear
and
gratitude
can
conquer
pride
when
she
went
home
he
walked
with
her
to
her
own
gate
shook
hands
cordially
and
touched
his
hat
as
he
marched
back
again
looking
very
stately
and
erect
like
a
handsome
soldierly
old
gentleman
as
he
was
when
the
girls
saw
that
performance
jo
began
to
dance
a
jig
by
way
of
expressing
her
satisfaction
amy
nearly
fell
out
of
the
window
in
her
surprise
and
meg
exclaimed
with
uplifted
hands
well
i
do
believe
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
vii
amy's
valley
of
humiliation
illustration
the
cyclops
that
boy
is
a
perfect
cyclops
isn't
he
said
amy
one
day
as
laurie
clattered
by
on
horseback
with
a
flourish
of
his
whip
as
he
passed
how
dare
you
say
so
when
he's
got
both
his
eyes
and
very
handsome
ones
they
are
too
cried
jo
who
resented
any
slighting
remarks
about
her
friend
i
didn't
say
anything
about
his
eyes
and
i
don't
see
why
you
need
fire
up
when
i
admire
his
riding
oh
my
goodness
that
little
goose
means
a
centaur
and
she
called
him
a
cyclops
exclaimed
jo
with
a
burst
of
laughter
you
needn't
be
so
rude
it's
only
a
'lapse
of
lingy,'
as
mr
davis
says
retorted
amy
finishing
jo
with
her
latin
i
just
wish
i
had
a
little
of
the
money
laurie
spends
on
that
horse
she
added
as
if
to
herself
yet
hoping
her
sisters
would
hear
why
asked
meg
kindly
for
jo
had
gone
off
in
another
laugh
at
amy's
second
blunder
i
need
it
so
much
i'm
dreadfully
in
debt
and
it
won't
be
my
turn
to
have
the
rag-money
for
a
month
in
debt
amy
what
do
you
mean
and
meg
looked
sober
why
i
owe
at
least
a
dozen
pickled
limes
and
i
can't
pay
them
you
know
till
i
have
money
for
marmee
forbade
my
having
anything
charged
at
the
shop
tell
me
all
about
it
are
limes
the
fashion
now
it
used
to
be
pricking
bits
of
rubber
to
make
balls
and
meg
tried
to
keep
her
countenance
amy
looked
so
grave
and
important
why
you
see
the
girls
are
always
buying
them
and
unless
you
want
to
be
thought
mean
you
must
do
it
too
it's
nothing
but
limes
now
for
every
one
is
sucking
them
in
their
desks
in
school-time
and
trading
them
off
for
pencils
bead-rings
paper
dolls
or
something
else
at
recess
if
one
girl
likes
another
she
gives
her
a
lime
if
she's
mad
with
her
she
eats
one
before
her
face
and
don't
offer
even
a
suck
they
treat
by
turns
and
i've
had
ever
so
many
but
haven't
returned
them
and
i
ought
for
they
are
debts
of
honor
you
know
how
much
will
pay
them
off
and
restore
your
credit
asked
meg
taking
out
her
purse
a
quarter
would
more
than
do
it
and
leave
a
few
cents
over
for
a
treat
for
you
don't
you
like
limes
not
much
you
may
have
my
share
here's
the
money
make
it
last
as
long
as
you
can
for
it
isn't
very
plenty
you
know
oh
thank
you
it
must
be
so
nice
to
have
pocket-money
i'll
have
a
grand
feast
for
i
haven't
tasted
a
lime
this
week
i
felt
delicate
about
taking
any
as
i
couldn't
return
them
and
i'm
actually
suffering
for
one
next
day
amy
was
rather
late
at
school
but
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
displaying
with
pardonable
pride
a
moist
brown-paper
parcel
before
she
consigned
it
to
the
inmost
recesses
of
her
desk
during
the
next
few
minutes
the
rumor
that
amy
march
had
got
twenty-four
delicious
limes
she
ate
one
on
the
way
and
was
going
to
treat
circulated
through
her
set
and
the
attentions
of
her
friends
became
quite
overwhelming
katy
brown
invited
her
to
her
next
party
on
the
spot
mary
kingsley
insisted
on
lending
her
her
watch
till
recess
and
jenny
snow
a
satirical
young
lady
who
had
basely
twitted
amy
upon
her
limeless
state
promptly
buried
the
hatchet
and
offered
to
furnish
answers
to
certain
appalling
sums
but
amy
had
not
forgotten
miss
snow's
cutting
remarks
about
some
persons
whose
noses
were
not
too
flat
to
smell
other
people's
limes
and
stuck-up
people
who
were
not
too
proud
to
ask
for
them
and
she
instantly
crushed
that
snow
girl's
hopes
by
the
withering
telegram
you
needn't
be
so
polite
all
of
a
sudden
for
you
won't
get
any
a
distinguished
personage
happened
to
visit
the
school
that
morning
and
amy's
beautifully
drawn
maps
received
praise
which
honor
to
her
foe
rankled
in
the
soul
of
miss
snow
and
caused
miss
march
to
assume
the
airs
of
a
studious
young
peacock
but
alas
alas
pride
goes
before
a
fall
and
the
revengeful
snow
turned
the
tables
with
disastrous
success
no
sooner
had
the
guest
paid
the
usual
stale
compliments
and
bowed
himself
out
than
jenny
under
pretence
of
asking
an
important
question
informed
mr
davis
the
teacher
that
amy
march
had
pickled
limes
in
her
desk
now
mr
davis
had
declared
limes
a
contraband
article
and
solemnly
vowed
to
publicly
ferrule
the
first
person
who
was
found
breaking
the
law
this
much-enduring
man
had
succeeded
in
banishing
chewing-gum
after
a
long
and
stormy
war
had
made
a
bonfire
of
the
confiscated
novels
and
newspapers
had
suppressed
a
private
post-office
had
forbidden
distortions
of
the
face
nicknames
and
caricatures
and
done
all
that
one
man
could
do
to
keep
half
a
hundred
rebellious
girls
in
order
boys
are
trying
enough
to
human
patience
goodness
knows
but
girls
are
infinitely
more
so
especially
to
nervous
gentlemen
with
tyrannical
tempers
and
no
more
talent
for
teaching
than
dr
blimber
mr
davis
knew
any
quantity
of
greek
latin
algebra
and
ologies
of
all
sorts
so
he
was
called
a
fine
teacher
and
manners
morals
feelings
and
examples
were
not
considered
of
any
particular
importance
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
moment
for
denouncing
amy
and
jenny
knew
it
mr
davis
had
evidently
taken
his
coffee
too
strong
that
morning
there
was
an
east
wind
which
always
affected
his
neuralgia
and
his
pupils
had
not
done
him
the
credit
which
he
felt
he
deserved
therefore
to
use
the
expressive
if
not
elegant
language
of
a
school-girl
he
was
as
nervous
as
a
witch
and
as
cross
as
a
bear
the
word
limes
was
like
fire
to
powder
his
yellow
face
flushed
and
he
rapped
on
his
desk
with
an
energy
which
made
jenny
skip
to
her
seat
with
unusual
rapidity
young
ladies
attention
if
you
please
at
the
stern
order
the
buzz
ceased
and
fifty
pairs
of
blue
black
gray
and
brown
eyes
were
obediently
fixed
upon
his
awful
countenance
miss
march
come
to
the
desk
amy
rose
to
comply
with
outward
composure
but
a
secret
fear
oppressed
her
for
the
limes
weighed
upon
her
conscience
bring
with
you
the
limes
you
have
in
your
desk
was
the
unexpected
command
which
arrested
her
before
she
got
out
of
her
seat
don't
take
all
whispered
her
neighbor
a
young
lady
of
great
presence
of
mind
amy
hastily
shook
out
half
a
dozen
and
laid
the
rest
down
before
mr
davis
feeling
that
any
man
possessing
a
human
heart
would
relent
when
that
delicious
perfume
met
his
nose
unfortunately
mr
davis
particularly
detested
the
odor
of
the
fashionable
pickle
and
disgust
added
to
his
wrath
is
that
all
not
quite
stammered
amy
bring
the
rest
immediately
with
a
despairing
glance
at
her
set
she
obeyed
you
are
sure
there
are
no
more
i
never
lie
sir
so
i
see
now
take
these
disgusting
things
two
by
two
and
throw
them
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
simultaneous
sigh
which
created
quite
a
little
gust
as
the
last
hope
fled
and
the
treat
was
ravished
from
their
longing
lips
scarlet
with
shame
and
anger
amy
went
to
and
fro
six
dreadful
times
and
as
each
doomed
couple--looking
oh
so
plump
and
juicy--fell
from
her
reluctant
hands
a
shout
from
the
street
completed
the
anguish
of
the
girls
for
it
told
them
that
their
feast
was
being
exulted
over
by
the
little
irish
children
who
were
their
sworn
foes
this--this
was
too
much
all
flashed
indignant
or
appealing
glances
at
the
inexorable
davis
and
one
passionate
lime-lover
burst
into
tears
as
amy
returned
from
her
last
trip
mr
davis
gave
a
portentous
hem
and
said
in
his
most
impressive
manner,--
young
ladies
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
a
week
ago
i
am
sorry
this
has
happened
but
i
never
allow
my
rules
to
be
infringed
and
i
_never_
break
my
word
miss
march
hold
out
your
hand
amy
started
and
put
both
hands
behind
her
turning
on
him
an
imploring
look
which
pleaded
for
her
better
than
the
words
she
could
not
utter
she
was
rather
a
favorite
with
old
davis
as
of
course
he
was
called
and
it's
my
private
belief
that
he
_would_
have
broken
his
word
if
the
indignation
of
one
irrepressible
young
lady
had
not
found
vent
in
a
hiss
that
hiss
faint
as
it
was
irritated
the
irascible
gentleman
and
sealed
the
culprit's
fate
your
hand
miss
march
was
the
only
answer
her
mute
appeal
received
and
too
proud
to
cry
or
beseech
amy
set
her
teeth
threw
back
her
head
defiantly
and
bore
without
flinching
several
tingling
blows
on
her
little
palm
they
were
neither
many
nor
heavy
but
that
made
no
difference
to
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
been
struck
and
the
disgrace
in
her
eyes
was
as
deep
as
if
he
had
knocked
her
down
illustration
amy
bore
without
flinching
several
tingling
blows
you
will
now
stand
on
the
platform
till
recess
said
mr
davis
resolved
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
since
he
had
begun
that
was
dreadful
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
to
go
to
her
seat
and
see
the
pitying
faces
of
her
friends
or
the
satisfied
ones
of
her
few
enemies
but
to
face
the
whole
school
with
that
shame
fresh
upon
her
seemed
impossible
and
for
a
second
she
felt
as
if
she
could
only
drop
down
where
she
stood
and
break
her
heart
with
crying
a
bitter
sense
of
wrong
and
the
thought
of
jenny
snow
helped
her
to
bear
it
and
taking
the
ignominious
place
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
stove-funnel
above
what
now
seemed
a
sea
of
faces
and
stood
there
so
motionless
and
white
that
the
girls
found
it
very
hard
to
study
with
that
pathetic
figure
before
them
during
the
fifteen
minutes
that
followed
the
proud
and
sensitive
little
girl
suffered
a
shame
and
pain
which
she
never
forgot
to
others
it
might
seem
a
ludicrous
or
trivial
affair
but
to
her
it
was
a
hard
experience
for
during
the
twelve
years
of
her
life
she
had
been
governed
by
love
alone
and
a
blow
of
that
sort
had
never
touched
her
before
the
smart
of
her
hand
and
the
ache
of
her
heart
were
forgotten
in
the
sting
of
the
thought,--
i
shall
have
to
tell
at
home
and
they
will
be
so
disappointed
in
me
the
fifteen
minutes
seemed
an
hour
but
they
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
the
word
recess
had
never
seemed
so
welcome
to
her
before
you
can
go
miss
march
said
mr
davis
looking
as
he
felt
uncomfortable
he
did
not
soon
forget
the
reproachful
glance
amy
gave
him
as
she
went
without
a
word
to
any
one
straight
into
the
ante-room
snatched
her
things
and
left
the
place
forever
as
she
passionately
declared
to
herself
she
was
in
a
sad
state
when
she
got
home
and
when
the
older
girls
arrived
some
time
later
an
indignation
meeting
was
held
at
once
mrs
march
did
not
say
much
but
looked
disturbed
and
comforted
her
afflicted
little
daughter
in
her
tenderest
manner
meg
bathed
the
insulted
hand
with
glycerine
and
tears
beth
felt
that
even
her
beloved
kittens
would
fail
as
a
balm
for
griefs
like
this
jo
wrathfully
proposed
that
mr
davis
be
arrested
without
delay
and
hannah
shook
her
fist
at
the
villain
and
pounded
potatoes
for
dinner
as
if
she
had
him
under
her
pestle
no
notice
was
taken
of
amy's
flight
except
by
her
mates
but
the
sharp-eyed
demoiselles
discovered
that
mr
davis
was
quite
benignant
in
the
afternoon
also
unusually
nervous
just
before
school
closed
jo
appeared
wearing
a
grim
expression
as
she
stalked
up
to
the
desk
and
delivered
a
letter
from
her
mother
then
collected
amy's
property
and
departed
carefully
scraping
the
mud
from
her
boots
on
the
door-mat
as
if
she
shook
the
dust
of
the
place
off
her
feet
yes
you
can
have
a
vacation
from
school
but
i
want
you
to
study
a
little
every
day
with
beth
said
mrs
march
that
evening
i
don't
approve
of
corporal
punishment
especially
for
girls
i
dislike
mr
davis's
manner
of
teaching
and
don't
think
the
girls
you
associate
with
are
doing
you
any
good
so
i
shall
ask
your
father's
advice
before
i
send
you
anywhere
else
that's
good
i
wish
all
the
girls
would
leave
and
spoil
his
old
school
it's
perfectly
maddening
to
think
of
those
lovely
limes
sighed
amy
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
i
am
not
sorry
you
lost
them
for
you
broke
the
rules
and
deserved
some
punishment
for
disobedience
was
the
severe
reply
which
rather
disappointed
the
young
lady
who
expected
nothing
but
sympathy
do
you
mean
you
are
glad
i
was
disgraced
before
the
whole
school
cried
amy
i
should
not
have
chosen
that
way
of
mending
a
fault
replied
her
mother
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
won't
do
you
more
good
than
a
milder
method
you
are
getting
to
be
rather
conceited
my
dear
and
it
is
quite
time
you
set
about
correcting
it
you
have
a
good
many
little
gifts
and
virtues
but
there
is
no
need
of
parading
them
for
conceit
spoils
the
finest
genius
there
is
not
much
danger
that
real
talent
or
goodness
will
be
overlooked
long
even
if
it
is
the
consciousness
of
possessing
and
using
it
well
should
satisfy
one
and
the
great
charm
of
all
power
is
modesty
so
it
is
cried
laurie
who
was
playing
chess
in
a
corner
with
jo
i
knew
a
girl
once
who
had
a
really
remarkable
talent
for
music
and
she
didn't
know
it
never
guessed
what
sweet
little
things
she
composed
when
she
was
alone
and
wouldn't
have
believed
it
if
any
one
had
told
her
i
wish
i'd
known
that
nice
girl
maybe
she
would
have
helped
me
i'm
so
stupid
said
beth
who
stood
beside
him
listening
eagerly
you
do
know
her
and
she
helps
you
better
than
any
one
else
could
answered
laurie
looking
at
her
with
such
mischievous
meaning
in
his
merry
black
eyes
that
beth
suddenly
turned
very
red
and
hid
her
face
in
the
sofa-cushion
quite
overcome
by
such
an
unexpected
discovery
illustration
you
do
know
her
jo
let
laurie
win
the
game
to
pay
for
that
praise
of
her
beth
who
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
play
for
them
after
her
compliment
so
laurie
did
his
best
and
sung
delightfully
being
in
a
particularly
lively
humor
for
to
the
marches
he
seldom
showed
the
moody
side
of
his
character
when
he
was
gone
amy
who
had
been
pensive
all
the
evening
said
suddenly
as
if
busy
over
some
new
idea,--
is
laurie
an
accomplished
boy
yes
he
has
had
an
excellent
education
and
has
much
talent
he
will
make
a
fine
man
if
not
spoilt
by
petting
replied
her
mother
and
he
isn't
conceited
is
he
asked
amy
not
in
the
least
that
is
why
he
is
so
charming
and
we
all
like
him
so
much
i
see
it's
nice
to
have
accomplishments
and
be
elegant
but
not
to
show
off
or
get
perked
up
said
amy
thoughtfully
these
things
are
always
seen
and
felt
in
a
person's
manner
and
conversation
if
modestly
used
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
display
them
said
mrs
march
any
more
than
it's
proper
to
wear
all
your
bonnets
and
gowns
and
ribbons
at
once
that
folks
may
know
you've
got
them
added
jo
and
the
lecture
ended
in
a
laugh
illustration
girls
where
are
you
going
viii
jo
meets
apollyon
girls
where
are
you
going
asked
amy
coming
into
their
room
one
saturday
afternoon
and
finding
them
getting
ready
to
go
out
with
an
air
of
secrecy
which
excited
her
curiosity
never
mind
little
girls
shouldn't
ask
questions
returned
jo
sharply
now
if
there
_is_
anything
mortifying
to
our
feelings
when
we
are
young
it
is
to
be
told
that
and
to
be
bidden
to
run
away
dear
is
still
more
trying
to
us
amy
bridled
up
at
this
insult
and
determined
to
find
out
the
secret
if
she
teased
for
an
hour
turning
to
meg
who
never
refused
her
anything
very
long
she
said
coaxingly
do
tell
me
i
should
think
you
might
let
me
go
too
for
beth
is
fussing
over
her
piano
and
i
haven't
got
anything
to
do
and
am
_so_
lonely
i
can't
dear
because
you
aren't
invited
began
meg
but
jo
broke
in
impatiently
now
meg
be
quiet
or
you
will
spoil
it
all
you
can't
go
amy
so
don't
be
a
baby
and
whine
about
it
you
are
going
somewhere
with
laurie
i
know
you
are
you
were
whispering
and
laughing
together
on
the
sofa
last
night
and
you
stopped
when
i
came
in
aren't
you
going
with
him
yes
we
are
now
do
be
still
and
stop
bothering
amy
held
her
tongue
but
used
her
eyes
and
saw
meg
slip
a
fan
into
her
pocket
i
know
i
know
you're
going
to
the
theatre
to
see
the
'seven
castles!'
she
cried
adding
resolutely
and
i
_shall_
go
for
mother
said
i
might
see
it
and
i've
got
my
rag-money
and
it
was
mean
not
to
tell
me
in
time
just
listen
to
me
a
minute
and
be
a
good
child
said
meg
soothingly
mother
doesn't
wish
you
to
go
this
week
because
your
eyes
are
not
well
enough
yet
to
bear
the
light
of
this
fairy
piece
next
week
you
can
go
with
beth
and
hannah
and
have
a
nice
time
i
don't
like
that
half
as
well
as
going
with
you
and
laurie
please
let
me
i've
been
sick
with
this
cold
so
long
and
shut
up
i'm
dying
for
some
fun
do
meg
i'll
be
ever
so
good
pleaded
amy
looking
as
pathetic
as
she
could
suppose
we
take
her
i
don't
believe
mother
would
mind
if
we
bundle
her
up
well
began
meg
if
_she_
goes
_i_
sha'n't
and
if
i
don't
laurie
won't
like
it
and
it
will
be
very
rude
after
he
invited
only
us
to
go
and
drag
in
amy
i
should
think
she'd
hate
to
poke
herself
where
she
isn't
wanted
said
jo
crossly
for
she
disliked
the
trouble
of
overseeing
a
fidgety
child
when
she
wanted
to
enjoy
herself
her
tone
and
manner
angered
amy
who
began
to
put
her
boots
on
saying
in
her
most
aggravating
way
i
_shall_
go
meg
says
i
may
and
if
i
pay
for
myself
laurie
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
it
you
can't
sit
with
us
for
our
seats
are
reserved
and
you
mustn't
sit
alone
so
laurie
will
give
you
his
place
and
that
will
spoil
our
pleasure
or
he'll
get
another
seat
for
you
and
that
isn't
proper
when
you
weren't
asked
you
sha'n't
stir
a
step
so
you
may
just
stay
where
you
are
scolded
jo
crosser
than
ever
having
just
pricked
her
finger
in
her
hurry
sitting
on
the
floor
with
one
boot
on
amy
began
to
cry
and
meg
to
reason
with
her
when
laurie
called
from
below
and
the
two
girls
hurried
down
leaving
their
sister
wailing
for
now
and
then
she
forgot
her
grown-up
ways
and
acted
like
a
spoilt
child
just
as
the
party
was
setting
out
amy
called
over
the
banisters
in
a
threatening
tone
you'll
be
sorry
for
this
jo
march
see
if
you
ain't
fiddlesticks
returned
jo
slamming
the
door
they
had
a
charming
time
for
the
seven
castles
of
the
diamond
lake
were
as
brilliant
and
wonderful
as
heart
could
wish
but
in
spite
of
the
comical
red
imps
sparkling
elves
and
gorgeous
princes
and
princesses
jo's
pleasure
had
a
drop
of
bitterness
in
it
the
fairy
queen's
yellow
curls
reminded
her
of
amy
and
between
the
acts
she
amused
herself
with
wondering
what
her
sister
would
do
to
make
her
sorry
for
it
she
and
amy
had
had
many
lively
skirmishes
in
the
course
of
their
lives
for
both
had
quick
tempers
and
were
apt
to
be
violent
when
fairly
roused
amy
teased
jo
and
jo
irritated
amy
and
semi-occasional
explosions
occurred
of
which
both
were
much
ashamed
afterward
although
the
oldest
jo
had
the
least
self-control
and
had
hard
times
trying
to
curb
the
fiery
spirit
which
was
continually
getting
her
into
trouble
her
anger
never
lasted
long
and
having
humbly
confessed
her
fault
she
sincerely
repented
and
tried
to
do
better
her
sisters
used
to
say
that
they
rather
liked
to
get
jo
into
a
fury
because
she
was
such
an
angel
afterward
poor
jo
tried
desperately
to
be
good
but
her
bosom
enemy
was
always
ready
to
flame
up
and
defeat
her
and
it
took
years
of
patient
effort
to
subdue
it
when
they
got
home
they
found
amy
reading
in
the
parlor
she
assumed
an
injured
air
as
they
came
in
never
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
book
or
asked
a
single
question
perhaps
curiosity
might
have
conquered
resentment
if
beth
had
not
been
there
to
inquire
and
receive
a
glowing
description
of
the
play
on
going
up
to
put
away
her
best
hat
jo's
first
look
was
toward
the
bureau
for
in
their
last
quarrel
amy
had
soothed
her
feelings
by
turning
jo's
top
drawer
upside
down
on
the
floor
everything
was
in
its
place
however
and
after
a
hasty
glance
into
her
various
closets
bags
and
boxes
jo
decided
that
amy
had
forgiven
and
forgotten
her
wrongs
there
jo
was
mistaken
for
next
day
she
made
a
discovery
which
produced
a
tempest
meg
beth
and
amy
were
sitting
together
late
in
the
afternoon
when
jo
burst
into
the
room
looking
excited
and
demanding
breathlessly
has
any
one
taken
my
book
meg
and
beth
said
no
at
once
and
looked
surprised
amy
poked
the
fire
and
said
nothing
jo
saw
her
color
rise
and
was
down
upon
her
in
a
minute
amy
you've
got
it
no
i
haven't
you
know
where
it
is
then
no
i
don't
that's
a
fib
cried
jo
taking
her
by
the
shoulders
and
looking
fierce
enough
to
frighten
a
much
braver
child
than
amy
it
isn't
i
haven't
got
it
don't
know
where
it
is
now
and
don't
care
you
know
something
about
it
and
you'd
better
tell
at
once
or
i'll
make
you
and
jo
gave
her
a
slight
shake
scold
as
much
as
you
like
you'll
never
see
your
silly
old
book
again
cried
amy
getting
excited
in
her
turn
why
not
i
burnt
it
up
illustration
i
burnt
it
up
what
my
little
book
i
was
so
fond
of
and
worked
over
and
meant
to
finish
before
father
got
home
have
you
really
burnt
it
said
jo
turning
very
pale
while
her
eyes
kindled
and
her
hands
clutched
amy
nervously
yes
i
did
i
told
you
i'd
make
you
pay
for
being
so
cross
yesterday
and
i
have
so--
amy
got
no
farther
for
jo's
hot
temper
mastered
her
and
she
shook
amy
till
her
teeth
chattered
in
her
head
crying
in
a
passion
of
grief
and
anger,--
you
wicked
wicked
girl
i
never
can
write
it
again
and
i'll
never
forgive
you
as
long
as
i
live
meg
flew
to
rescue
amy
and
beth
to
pacify
jo
but
jo
was
quite
beside
herself
and
with
a
parting
box
on
her
sister's
ear
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
up
to
the
old
sofa
in
the
garret
and
finished
her
fight
alone
the
storm
cleared
up
below
for
mrs
march
came
home
and
having
heard
the
story
soon
brought
amy
to
a
sense
of
the
wrong
she
had
done
her
sister
jo's
book
was
the
pride
of
her
heart
and
was
regarded
by
her
family
as
a
literary
sprout
of
great
promise
it
was
only
half
a
dozen
little
fairy
tales
but
jo
had
worked
over
them
patiently
putting
her
whole
heart
into
her
work
hoping
to
make
something
good
enough
to
print
she
had
just
copied
them
with
great
care
and
had
destroyed
the
old
manuscript
so
that
amy's
bonfire
had
consumed
the
loving
work
of
several
years
it
seemed
a
small
loss
to
others
but
to
jo
it
was
a
dreadful
calamity
and
she
felt
that
it
never
could
be
made
up
to
her
beth
mourned
as
for
a
departed
kitten
and
meg
refused
to
defend
her
pet
mrs
march
looked
grave
and
grieved
and
amy
felt
that
no
one
would
love
her
till
she
had
asked
pardon
for
the
act
which
she
now
regretted
more
than
any
of
them
when
the
tea-bell
rung
jo
appeared
looking
so
grim
and
unapproachable
that
it
took
all
amy's
courage
to
say
meekly,--
please
forgive
me
jo
i'm
very
very
sorry
i
never
shall
forgive
you
was
jo's
stern
answer
and
from
that
moment
she
ignored
amy
entirely
no
one
spoke
of
the
great
trouble,--not
even
mrs
march,--for
all
had
learned
by
experience
that
when
jo
was
in
that
mood
words
were
wasted
and
the
wisest
course
was
to
wait
till
some
little
accident
or
her
own
generous
nature
softened
jo's
resentment
and
healed
the
breach
it
was
not
a
happy
evening
for
though
they
sewed
as
usual
while
their
mother
read
aloud
from
bremer
scott
or
edgeworth
something
was
wanting
and
the
sweet
home-peace
was
disturbed
they
felt
this
most
when
singing-time
came
for
beth
could
only
play
jo
stood
dumb
as
a
stone
and
amy
broke
down
so
meg
and
mother
sung
alone
but
in
spite
of
their
efforts
to
be
as
cheery
as
larks
the
flute-like
voices
did
not
seem
to
chord
as
well
as
usual
and
all
felt
out
of
tune
as
jo
received
her
good-night
kiss
mrs
march
whispered
gently,--
my
dear
don't
let
the
sun
go
down
upon
your
anger
forgive
each
other
help
each
other
and
begin
again
to-morrow
jo
wanted
to
lay
her
head
down
on
that
motherly
bosom
and
cry
her
grief
and
anger
all
away
but
tears
were
an
unmanly
weakness
and
she
felt
so
deeply
injured
that
she
really
_couldn't_
quite
forgive
yet
so
she
winked
hard
shook
her
head
and
said
gruffly
because
amy
was
listening,--
it
was
an
abominable
thing
and
she
don't
deserve
to
be
forgiven
with
that
she
marched
off
to
bed
and
there
was
no
merry
or
confidential
gossip
that
night
amy
was
much
offended
that
her
overtures
of
peace
had
been
repulsed
and
began
to
wish
she
had
not
humbled
herself
to
feel
more
injured
than
ever
and
to
plume
herself
on
her
superior
virtue
in
a
way
which
was
particularly
exasperating
jo
still
looked
like
a
thunder-cloud
and
nothing
went
well
all
day
it
was
bitter
cold
in
the
morning
she
dropped
her
precious
turn-over
in
the
gutter
aunt
march
had
an
attack
of
fidgets
meg
was
pensive
beth
_would_
look
grieved
and
wistful
when
she
got
home
and
amy
kept
making
remarks
about
people
who
were
always
talking
about
being
good
and
yet
wouldn't
try
when
other
people
set
them
a
virtuous
example
everybody
is
so
hateful
i'll
ask
laurie
to
go
skating
he
is
always
kind
and
jolly
and
will
put
me
to
rights
i
know
said
jo
to
herself
and
off
she
went
amy
heard
the
clash
of
skates
and
looked
out
with
an
impatient
exclamation,--
there
she
promised
i
should
go
next
time
for
this
is
the
last
ice
we
shall
have
but
it's
no
use
to
ask
such
a
cross-patch
to
take
me
don't
say
that
you
_were_
very
naughty
and
it
_is_
hard
to
forgive
the
loss
of
her
precious
little
book
but
i
think
she
might
do
it
now
and
i
guess
she
will
if
you
try
her
at
the
right
minute
said
meg
go
after
them
don't
say
anything
till
jo
has
got
good-natured
with
laurie
then
take
a
quiet
minute
and
just
kiss
her
or
do
some
kind
thing
and
i'm
sure
she'll
be
friends
again
with
all
her
heart
i'll
try
said
amy
for
the
advice
suited
her
and
after
a
flurry
to
get
ready
she
ran
after
the
friends
who
were
just
disappearing
over
the
hill
it
was
not
far
to
the
river
but
both
were
ready
before
amy
reached
them
jo
saw
her
coming
and
turned
her
back
laurie
did
not
see
for
he
was
carefully
skating
along
the
shore
sounding
the
ice
for
a
warm
spell
had
preceded
the
cold
snap
i'll
go
on
to
the
first
bend
and
see
if
it's
all
right
before
we
begin
to
race
amy
heard
him
say
as
he
shot
away
looking
like
a
young
russian
in
his
fur-trimmed
coat
and
cap
jo
heard
amy
panting
after
her
run
stamping
her
feet
and
blowing
her
fingers
as
she
tried
to
put
her
skates
on
but
jo
never
turned
and
went
slowly
zigzagging
down
the
river
taking
a
bitter
unhappy
sort
of
satisfaction
in
her
sister's
troubles
she
had
cherished
her
anger
till
it
grew
strong
and
took
possession
of
her
as
evil
thoughts
and
feelings
always
do
unless
cast
out
at
once
as
laurie
turned
the
bend
he
shouted
back,--
keep
near
the
shore
it
isn't
safe
in
the
middle
jo
heard
but
amy
was
just
struggling
to
her
feet
and
did
not
catch
a
word
jo
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
the
little
demon
she
was
harboring
said
in
her
ear,--
no
matter
whether
she
heard
or
not
let
her
take
care
of
herself
laurie
had
vanished
round
the
bend
jo
was
just
at
the
turn
and
amy
far
behind
striking
out
toward
the
smoother
ice
in
the
middle
of
the
river
for
a
minute
jo
stood
still
with
a
strange
feeling
at
her
heart
then
she
resolved
to
go
on
but
something
held
and
turned
her
round
just
in
time
to
see
amy
throw
up
her
hands
and
go
down
with
the
sudden
crash
of
rotten
ice
the
splash
of
water
and
a
cry
that
made
jo's
heart
stand
still
with
fear
she
tried
to
call
laurie
but
her
voice
was
gone
she
tried
to
rush
forward
but
her
feet
seemed
to
have
no
strength
in
them
and
for
a
second
she
could
only
stand
motionless
staring
with
a
terror-stricken
face
at
the
little
blue
hood
above
the
black
water
something
rushed
swiftly
by
her
and
laurie's
voice
cried
out,--
bring
a
rail
quick
quick
how
she
did
it
she
never
knew
but
for
the
next
few
minutes
she
worked
as
if
possessed
blindly
obeying
laurie
who
was
quite
self-possessed
and
lying
flat
held
amy
up
by
his
arm
and
hockey
till
jo
dragged
a
rail
from
the
fence
and
together
they
got
the
child
out
more
frightened
than
hurt
illustration
held
amy
up
by
his
arms
and
hockey
now
then
we
must
walk
her
home
as
fast
as
we
can
pile
our
things
on
her
while
i
get
off
these
confounded
skates
cried
laurie
wrapping
his
coat
round
amy
and
tugging
away
at
the
straps
which
never
seemed
so
intricate
before
shivering
dripping
and
crying
they
got
amy
home
and
after
an
exciting
time
of
it
she
fell
asleep
rolled
in
blankets
before
a
hot
fire
during
the
bustle
jo
had
scarcely
spoken
but
flown
about
looking
pale
and
wild
with
her
things
half
off
her
dress
torn
and
her
hands
cut
and
bruised
by
ice
and
rails
and
refractory
buckles
when
amy
was
comfortably
asleep
the
house
quiet
and
mrs
march
sitting
by
the
bed
she
called
jo
to
her
and
began
to
bind
up
the
hurt
hands
are
you
sure
she
is
safe
whispered
jo
looking
remorsefully
at
the
golden
head
which
might
have
been
swept
away
from
her
sight
forever
under
the
treacherous
ice
quite
safe
dear
she
is
not
hurt
and
won't
even
take
cold
i
think
you
were
so
sensible
in
covering
and
getting
her
home
quickly
replied
her
mother
cheerfully
laurie
did
it
all
i
only
let
her
go
mother
if
she
_should_
die
it
would
be
my
fault
and
jo
dropped
down
beside
the
bed
in
a
passion
of
penitent
tears
telling
all
that
had
happened
bitterly
condemning
her
hardness
of
heart
and
sobbing
out
her
gratitude
for
being
spared
the
heavy
punishment
which
might
have
come
upon
her
it's
my
dreadful
temper
i
try
to
cure
it
i
think
i
have
and
then
it
breaks
out
worse
than
ever
o
mother
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
cried
poor
jo
in
despair
watch
and
pray
dear
never
get
tired
of
trying
and
never
think
it
is
impossible
to
conquer
your
fault
said
mrs
march
drawing
the
blowzy
head
to
her
shoulder
and
kissing
the
wet
cheek
so
tenderly
that
jo
cried
harder
than
ever
you
don't
know
you
can't
guess
how
bad
it
is
it
seems
as
if
i
could
do
anything
when
i'm
in
a
passion
i
get
so
savage
i
could
hurt
any
one
and
enjoy
it
i'm
afraid
i
_shall_
do
something
dreadful
some
day
and
spoil
my
life
and
make
everybody
hate
me
o
mother
help
me
do
help
me
i
will
my
child
i
will
don't
cry
so
bitterly
but
remember
this
day
and
resolve
with
all
your
soul
that
you
will
never
know
another
like
it
jo
dear
we
all
have
our
temptations
some
far
greater
than
yours
and
it
often
takes
us
all
our
lives
to
conquer
them
you
think
your
temper
is
the
worst
in
the
world
but
mine
used
to
be
just
like
it
yours
mother
why
you
are
never
angry
and
for
the
moment
jo
forgot
remorse
in
surprise
i've
been
trying
to
cure
it
for
forty
years
and
have
only
succeeded
in
controlling
it
i
am
angry
nearly
every
day
of
my
life
jo
but
i
have
learned
not
to
show
it
and
i
still
hope
to
learn
not
to
feel
it
though
it
may
take
me
another
forty
years
to
do
so
the
patience
and
the
humility
of
the
face
she
loved
so
well
was
a
better
lesson
to
jo
than
the
wisest
lecture
the
sharpest
reproof
she
felt
comforted
at
once
by
the
sympathy
and
confidence
given
her
the
knowledge
that
her
mother
had
a
fault
like
hers
and
tried
to
mend
it
made
her
own
easier
to
bear
and
strengthened
her
resolution
to
cure
it
though
forty
years
seemed
rather
a
long
time
to
watch
and
pray
to
a
girl
of
fifteen
mother
are
you
angry
when
you
fold
your
lips
tight
together
and
go
out
of
the
room
sometimes
when
aunt
march
scolds
or
people
worry
you
asked
jo
feeling
nearer
and
dearer
to
her
mother
than
ever
before
yes
i've
learned
to
check
the
hasty
words
that
rise
to
my
lips
and
when
i
feel
that
they
mean
to
break
out
against
my
will
i
just
go
away
a
minute
and
give
myself
a
little
shake
for
being
so
weak
and
wicked
answered
mrs
march
with
a
sigh
and
a
smile
as
she
smoothed
and
fastened
up
jo's
dishevelled
hair
how
did
you
learn
to
keep
still
that
is
what
troubles
me--for
the
sharp
words
fly
out
before
i
know
what
i'm
about
and
the
more
i
say
the
worse
i
get
till
it's
a
pleasure
to
hurt
people's
feelings
and
say
dreadful
things
tell
me
how
you
do
it
marmee
dear
my
good
mother
used
to
help
me--
as
you
do
us--
interrupted
jo
with
a
grateful
kiss
but
i
lost
her
when
i
was
a
little
older
than
you
are
and
for
years
had
to
struggle
on
alone
for
i
was
too
proud
to
confess
my
weakness
to
any
one
else
i
had
a
hard
time
jo
and
shed
a
good
many
bitter
tears
over
my
failures
for
in
spite
of
my
efforts
i
never
seemed
to
get
on
then
your
father
came
and
i
was
so
happy
that
i
found
it
easy
to
be
good
but
by
and
by
when
i
had
four
little
daughters
round
me
and
we
were
poor
then
the
old
trouble
began
again
for
i
am
not
patient
by
nature
and
it
tried
me
very
much
to
see
my
children
wanting
anything
poor
mother
what
helped
you
then
your
father
jo
he
never
loses
patience,--never
doubts
or
complains,--but
always
hopes
and
works
and
waits
so
cheerfully
that
one
is
ashamed
to
do
otherwise
before
him
he
helped
and
comforted
me
and
showed
me
that
i
must
try
to
practise
all
the
virtues
i
would
have
my
little
girls
possess
for
i
was
their
example
it
was
easier
to
try
for
your
sakes
than
for
my
own
a
startled
or
surprised
look
from
one
of
you
when
i
spoke
sharply
rebuked
me
more
than
any
words
could
have
done
and
the
love
respect
and
confidence
of
my
children
was
the
sweetest
reward
i
could
receive
for
my
efforts
to
be
the
woman
i
would
have
them
copy
o
mother
if
i'm
ever
half
as
good
as
you
i
shall
be
satisfied
cried
jo
much
touched
i
hope
you
will
be
a
great
deal
better
dear
but
you
must
keep
watch
over
your
'bosom
enemy,'
as
father
calls
it
or
it
may
sadden
if
not
spoil
your
life
you
have
had
a
warning
remember
it
and
try
with
heart
and
soul
to
master
this
quick
temper
before
it
brings
you
greater
sorrow
and
regret
than
you
have
known
to-day
i
will
try
mother
i
truly
will
but
you
must
help
me
remind
me
and
keep
me
from
flying
out
i
used
to
see
father
sometimes
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
look
at
you
with
a
very
kind
but
sober
face
and
you
always
folded
your
lips
tight
or
went
away
was
he
reminding
you
then
asked
jo
softly
yes
i
asked
him
to
help
me
so
and
he
never
forgot
it
but
saved
me
from
many
a
sharp
word
by
that
little
gesture
and
kind
look
jo
saw
that
her
mother's
eyes
filled
and
her
lips
trembled
as
she
spoke
and
fearing
that
she
had
said
too
much
she
whispered
anxiously
was
it
wrong
to
watch
you
and
to
speak
of
it
i
didn't
mean
to
be
rude
but
it's
so
comfortable
to
say
all
i
think
to
you
and
feel
so
safe
and
happy
here
my
jo
you
may
say
anything
to
your
mother
for
it
is
my
greatest
happiness
and
pride
to
feel
that
my
girls
confide
in
me
and
know
how
much
i
love
them
i
thought
i'd
grieved
you
no
dear
but
speaking
of
father
reminded
me
how
much
i
miss
him
how
much
i
owe
him
and
how
faithfully
i
should
watch
and
work
to
keep
his
little
daughters
safe
and
good
for
him
yet
you
told
him
to
go
mother
and
didn't
cry
when
he
went
and
never
complain
now
or
seem
as
if
you
needed
any
help
said
jo
wondering
i
gave
my
best
to
the
country
i
love
and
kept
my
tears
till
he
was
gone
why
should
i
complain
when
we
both
have
merely
done
our
duty
and
will
surely
be
the
happier
for
it
in
the
end
if
i
don't
seem
to
need
help
it
is
because
i
have
a
better
friend
even
than
father
to
comfort
and
sustain
me
my
child
the
troubles
and
temptations
of
your
life
are
beginning
and
may
be
many
but
you
can
overcome
and
outlive
them
all
if
you
learn
to
feel
the
strength
and
tenderness
of
your
heavenly
father
as
you
do
that
of
your
earthly
one
the
more
you
love
and
trust
him
the
nearer
you
will
feel
to
him
and
the
less
you
will
depend
on
human
power
and
wisdom
his
love
and
care
never
tire
or
change
can
never
be
taken
from
you
but
may
become
the
source
of
life-long
peace
happiness
and
strength
believe
this
heartily
and
go
to
god
with
all
your
little
cares
and
hopes
and
sins
and
sorrows
as
freely
and
confidingly
as
you
come
to
your
mother
jo's
only
answer
was
to
hold
her
mother
close
and
in
the
silence
which
followed
the
sincerest
prayer
she
had
ever
prayed
left
her
heart
without
words
for
in
that
sad
yet
happy
hour
she
had
learned
not
only
the
bitterness
of
remorse
and
despair
but
the
sweetness
of
self-denial
and
self-control
and
led
by
her
mother's
hand
she
had
drawn
nearer
to
the
friend
who
welcomes
every
child
with
a
love
stronger
than
that
of
any
father
tenderer
than
that
of
any
mother
amy
stirred
and
sighed
in
her
sleep
and
as
if
eager
to
begin
at
once
to
mend
her
fault
jo
looked
up
with
an
expression
on
her
face
which
it
had
never
worn
before
i
let
the
sun
go
down
on
my
anger
i
wouldn't
forgive
her
and
to-day
if
it
hadn't
been
for
laurie
it
might
have
been
too
late
how
could
i
be
so
wicked
said
jo
half
aloud
as
she
leaned
over
her
sister
softly
stroking
the
wet
hair
scattered
on
the
pillow
as
if
she
heard
amy
opened
her
eyes
and
held
out
her
arms
with
a
smile
that
went
straight
to
jo's
heart
neither
said
a
word
but
they
hugged
one
another
close
in
spite
of
the
blankets
and
everything
was
forgiven
and
forgotten
in
one
hearty
kiss

give
you
out
of
the
treasure-box
asked
amy
who
had
not
been
present
at
the
opening
of
a
certain
cedar
chest
in
which
mrs
march
kept
a
few
relics
of
past
splendor
as
gifts
for
her
girls
when
the
proper
time
came
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
that
pretty
carved
fan
and
a
lovely
blue
sash
i
wanted
the
violet
silk
but
there
isn't
time
to
make
it
over
so
i
must
be
contented
with
my
old
tarlatan
it
will
look
nicely
over
my
new
muslin
skirt
and
the
sash
will
set
it
off
beautifully
i
wish
i
hadn't
smashed
my
coral
bracelet
for
you
might
have
had
it
said
jo
who
loved
to
give
and
lend
but
whose
possessions
were
usually
too
dilapidated
to
be
of
much
use
there
is
a
lovely
old-fashioned
pearl
set
in
the
treasure-box
but
mother
said
real
flowers
were
the
prettiest
ornament
for
a
young
girl
and
laurie
promised
to
send
me
all
i
want
replied
meg
now
let
me
see
there's
my
new
gray
walking-suit--just
curl
up
the
feather
in
my
hat
beth,--then
my
poplin
for
sunday
and
the
small
party,--it
looks
heavy
for
spring
doesn't
it
the
violet
silk
would
be
so
nice
oh
dear
never
mind
you've
got
the
tarlatan
for
the
big
party
and
you
always
look
like
an
angel
in
white
said
amy
brooding
over
the
little
store
of
finery
in
which
her
soul
delighted
it
isn't
low-necked
and
it
doesn't
sweep
enough
but
it
will
have
to
do
my
blue
house-dress
looks
so
well
turned
and
freshly
trimmed
that
i
feel
as
if
i'd
got
a
new
one
my
silk
sacque
isn't
a
bit
the
fashion
and
my
bonnet
doesn't
look
like
sallie's
i
didn't
like
to
say
anything
but
i
was
sadly
disappointed
in
my
umbrella
i
told
mother
black
with
a
white
handle
but
she
forgot
and
bought
a
green
one
with
a
yellowish
handle
it's
strong
and
neat
so
i
ought
not
to
complain
but
i
know
i
shall
feel
ashamed
of
it
beside
annie's
silk
one
with
a
gold
top
sighed
meg
surveying
the
little
umbrella
with
great
disfavor
change
it
advised
jo
i
won't
be
so
silly
or
hurt
marmee's
feelings
when
she
took
so
much
pains
to
get
my
things
it's
a
nonsensical
notion
of
mine
and
i'm
not
going
to
give
up
to
it
my
silk
stockings
and
two
pairs
of
new
gloves
are
my
comfort
you
are
a
dear
to
lend
me
yours
jo
i
feel
so
rich
and
sort
of
elegant
with
two
new
pairs
and
the
old
ones
cleaned
up
for
common
and
meg
took
a
refreshing
peep
at
her
glove-box
annie
moffat
has
blue
and
pink
bows
on
her
night-caps
would
you
put
some
on
mine
she
asked
as
beth
brought
up
a
pile
of
snowy
muslins
fresh
from
hannah's
hands
no
i
wouldn't
for
the
smart
caps
won't
match
the
plain
gowns
without
any
trimming
on
them
poor
folks
shouldn't
rig
said
jo
decidedly
i
wonder
if
i
shall
_ever_
be
happy
enough
to
have
real
lace
on
my
clothes
and
bows
on
my
caps
said
meg
impatiently
you
said
the
other
day
that
you'd
be
perfectly
happy
if
you
could
only
go
to
annie
moffat's
observed
beth
in
her
quiet
way
so
i
did
well
i
_am_
happy
and
i
_won't_
fret
but
it
does
seem
as
if
the
more
one
gets
the
more
one
wants
doesn't
it
there
now
the
trays
are
ready
and
everything
in
but
my
ball-dress
which
i
shall
leave
for
mother
to
pack
said
meg
cheering
up
as
she
glanced
from
the
half-filled
trunk
to
the
many-times
pressed
and
mended
white
tarlatan
which
she
called
her
ball-dress
with
an
important
air
the
next
day
was
fine
and
meg
departed
in
style
for
a
fortnight
of
novelty
and
pleasure
mrs
march
had
consented
to
the
visit
rather
reluctantly
fearing
that
margaret
would
come
back
more
discontented
than
she
went
but
she
had
begged
so
hard
and
sallie
had
promised
to
take
good
care
of
her
and
a
little
pleasure
seemed
so
delightful
after
a
winter
of
irksome
work
that
the
mother
yielded
and
the
daughter
went
to
take
her
first
taste
of
fashionable
life
the
moffats
_were_
very
fashionable
and
simple
meg
was
rather
daunted
at
first
by
the
splendor
of
the
house
and
the
elegance
of
its
occupants
but
they
were
kindly
people
in
spite
of
the
frivolous
life
they
led
and
soon
put
their
guest
at
her
ease
perhaps
meg
felt
without
understanding
why
that
they
were
not
particularly
cultivated
or
intelligent
people
and
that
all
their
gilding
could
not
quite
conceal
the
ordinary
material
of
which
they
were
made
it
certainly
was
agreeable
to
fare
sumptuously
drive
in
a
fine
carriage
wear
her
best
frock
every
day
and
do
nothing
but
enjoy
herself
it
suited
her
exactly
and
soon
she
began
to
imitate
the
manners
and
conversation
of
those
about
her
to
put
on
little
airs
and
graces
use
french
phrases
crimp
her
hair
take
in
her
dresses
and
talk
about
the
fashions
as
well
as
she
could
the
more
she
saw
of
annie
moffat's
pretty
things
the
more
she
envied
her
and
sighed
to
be
rich
home
now
looked
bare
and
dismal
as
she
thought
of
it
work
grew
harder
than
ever
and
she
felt
that
she
was
a
very
destitute
and
much-injured
girl
in
spite
of
the
new
gloves
and
silk
stockings
she
had
not
much
time
for
repining
however
for
the
three
young
girls
were
busily
employed
in
having
a
good
time
they
shopped
walked
rode
and
called
all
day
went
to
theatres
and
operas
or
frolicked
at
home
in
the
evening
for
annie
had
many
friends
and
knew
how
to
entertain
them
her
older
sisters
were
very
fine
young
ladies
and
one
was
engaged
which
was
extremely
interesting
and
romantic
meg
thought
mr
moffat
was
a
fat
jolly
old
gentleman
who
knew
her
father
and
mrs
moffat
a
fat
jolly
old
lady
who
took
as
great
a
fancy
to
meg
as
her
daughter
had
done
every
one
petted
her
and
daisy
as
they
called
her
was
in
a
fair
way
to
have
her
head
turned
when
the
evening
for
the
small
party
came
she
found
that
the
poplin
wouldn't
do
at
all
for
the
other
girls
were
putting
on
thin
dresses
and
making
themselves
very
fine
indeed
so
out
came
the
tarlatan
looking
older
limper
and
shabbier
than
ever
beside
sallie's
crisp
new
one
meg
saw
the
girls
glance
at
it
and
then
at
one
another
and
her
cheeks
began
to
burn
for
with
all
her
gentleness
she
was
very
proud
no
one
said
a
word
about
it
but
sallie
offered
to
dress
her
hair
and
annie
to
tie
her
sash
and
belle
the
engaged
sister
praised
her
white
arms
but
in
their
kindness
meg
saw
only
pity
for
her
poverty
and
her
heart
felt
very
heavy
as
she
stood
by
herself
while
the
others
laughed
chattered
and
flew
about
like
gauzy
butterflies
the
hard
bitter
feeling
was
getting
pretty
bad
when
the
maid
brought
in
a
box
of
flowers
before
she
could
speak
annie
had
the
cover
off
and
all
were
exclaiming
at
the
lovely
roses
heath
and
fern
within
it's
for
belle
of
course
george
always
sends
her
some
but
these
are
altogether
ravishing
cried
annie
with
a
great
sniff
they
are
for
miss
march
the
man
said
and
here's
a
note
put
in
the
maid
holding
it
to
meg
what
fun
who
are
they
from
didn't
know
you
had
a
lover
cried
the
girls
fluttering
about
meg
in
a
high
state
of
curiosity
and
surprise
the
note
is
from
mother
and
the
flowers
from
laurie
said
meg
simply
yet
much
gratified
that
he
had
not
forgotten
her
oh
indeed
said
annie
with
a
funny
look
as
meg
slipped
the
note
into
her
pocket
as
a
sort
of
talisman
against
envy
vanity
and
false
pride
for
the
few
loving
words
had
done
her
good
and
the
flowers
cheered
her
up
by
their
beauty
feeling
almost
happy
again
she
laid
by
a
few
ferns
and
roses
for
herself
and
quickly
made
up
the
rest
in
dainty
bouquets
for
the
breasts
hair
or
skirts
of
her
friends
offering
them
so
prettily
that
clara
the
elder
sister
told
her
she
was
the
sweetest
little
thing
she
ever
saw
and
they
looked
quite
charmed
with
her
small
attention
somehow
the
kind
act
finished
her
despondency
and
when
all
the
rest
went
to
show
themselves
to
mrs
moffat
she
saw
a
happy
bright-eyed
face
in
the
mirror
as
she
laid
her
ferns
against
her
rippling
hair
and
fastened
the
roses
in
the
dress
that
didn't
strike
her
as
so
_very_
shabby
now
she
enjoyed
herself
very
much
that
evening
for
she
danced
to
her
heart's
content
every
one
was
very
kind
and
she
had
three
compliments
annie
made
her
sing
and
some
one
said
she
had
a
remarkably
fine
voice
major
lincoln
asked
who
the
fresh
little
girl
with
the
beautiful
eyes
was
and
mr
moffat
insisted
on
dancing
with
her
because
she
didn't
dawdle
but
had
some
spring
in
her
as
he
gracefully
expressed
it
so
altogether
she
had
a
very
nice
time
till
she
overheard
a
bit
of
a
conversation
which
disturbed
her
extremely
she
was
sitting
just
inside
the
conservatory
waiting
for
her
partner
to
bring
her
an
ice
when
she
heard
a
voice
ask
on
the
other
side
of
the
flowery
wall,--
how
old
is
he
sixteen
or
seventeen
i
should
say
replied
another
voice
it
would
be
a
grand
thing
for
one
of
those
girls
wouldn't
it
sallie
says
they
are
very
intimate
now
and
the
old
man
quite
dotes
on
them
mrs
m
has
made
her
plans
i
dare
say
and
will
play
her
cards
well
early
as
it
is
the
girl
evidently
doesn't
think
of
it
yet
said
mrs
moffat
she
told
that
fib
about
her
mamma
as
if
she
did
know
and
colored
up
when
the
flowers
came
quite
prettily
poor
thing
she'd
be
so
nice
if
she
was
only
got
up
in
style
do
you
think
she'd
be
offended
if
we
offered
to
lend
her
a
dress
for
thursday
asked
another
voice
she's
proud
but
i
don't
believe
she'd
mind
for
that
dowdy
tarlatan
is
all
she
has
got
she
may
tear
it
to-night
and
that
will
be
a
good
excuse
for
offering
a
decent
one
we'll
see
i
shall
ask
young
laurence
as
a
compliment
to
her
and
we'll
have
fun
about
it
afterward
illustration
meg's
partner
appeared
here
meg's
partner
appeared
to
find
her
looking
much
flushed
and
rather
agitated
she
_was_
proud
and
her
pride
was
useful
just
then
for
it
helped
her
hide
her
mortification
anger
and
disgust
at
what
she
had
just
heard
for
innocent
and
unsuspicious
as
she
was
she
could
not
help
understanding
the
gossip
of
her
friends
she
tried
to
forget
it
but
could
not
and
kept
repeating
to
herself
mrs
m
has
made
her
plans
that
fib
about
her
mamma
and
dowdy
tarlatan
till
she
was
ready
to
cry
and
rush
home
to
tell
her
troubles
and
ask
for
advice
as
that
was
impossible
she
did
her
best
to
seem
gay
and
being
rather
excited
she
succeeded
so
well
that
no
one
dreamed
what
an
effort
she
was
making
she
was
very
glad
when
it
was
all
over
and
she
was
quiet
in
her
bed
where
she
could
think
and
wonder
and
fume
till
her
head
ached
and
her
hot
cheeks
were
cooled
by
a
few
natural
tears
those
foolish
yet
well-meant
words
had
opened
a
new
world
to
meg
and
much
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
old
one
in
which
till
now
she
had
lived
as
happily
as
a
child
her
innocent
friendship
with
laurie
was
spoilt
by
the
silly
speeches
she
had
overheard
her
faith
in
her
mother
was
a
little
shaken
by
the
worldly
plans
attributed
to
her
by
mrs
moffat
who
judged
others
by
herself
and
the
sensible
resolution
to
be
contented
with
the
simple
wardrobe
which
suited
a
poor
man's
daughter
was
weakened
by
the
unnecessary
pity
of
girls
who
thought
a
shabby
dress
one
of
the
greatest
calamities
under
heaven
poor
meg
had
a
restless
night
and
got
up
heavy-eyed
unhappy
half
resentful
toward
her
friends
and
half
ashamed
of
herself
for
not
speaking
out
frankly
and
setting
everything
right
everybody
dawdled
that
morning
and
it
was
noon
before
the
girls
found
energy
enough
even
to
take
up
their
worsted
work
something
in
the
manner
of
her
friends
struck
meg
at
once
they
treated
her
with
more
respect
she
thought
took
quite
a
tender
interest
in
what
she
said
and
looked
at
her
with
eyes
that
plainly
betrayed
curiosity
all
this
surprised
and
flattered
her
though
she
did
not
understand
it
till
miss
belle
looked
up
from
her
writing
and
said
with
a
sentimental
air,--
daisy
dear
i've
sent
an
invitation
to
your
friend
mr
laurence
for
thursday
we
should
like
to
know
him
and
it's
only
a
proper
compliment
to
you
meg
colored
but
a
mischievous
fancy
to
tease
the
girls
made
her
reply
demurely,--
you
are
very
kind
but
i'm
afraid
he
won't
come
why
not
_chérie_
asked
miss
belle
he's
too
old
my
child
what
do
you
mean
what
is
his
age
i
beg
to
know
cried
miss
clara
nearly
seventy
i
believe
answered
meg
counting
stitches
to
hide
the
merriment
in
her
eyes
you
sly
creature
of
course
we
meant
the
young
man
exclaimed
miss
belle
laughing
there
isn't
any
laurie
is
only
a
little
boy
and
meg
laughed
also
at
the
queer
look
which
the
sisters
exchanged
as
she
thus
described
her
supposed
lover
about
your
age
nan
said
nearer
my
sister
jo's
_i_
am
seventeen
in
august
returned
meg
tossing
her
head
it's
very
nice
of
him
to
send
you
flowers
isn't
it
said
annie
looking
wise
about
nothing
yes
he
often
does
to
all
of
us
for
their
house
is
full
and
we
are
so
fond
of
them
my
mother
and
old
mr
laurence
are
friends
you
know
so
it
is
quite
natural
that
we
children
should
play
together
and
meg
hoped
they
would
say
no
more
it's
evident
daisy
isn't
out
yet
said
miss
clara
to
belle
with
a
nod
quite
a
pastoral
state
of
innocence
all
round
returned
miss
belle
with
a
shrug
i'm
going
out
to
get
some
little
matters
for
my
girls
can
i
do
anything
for
you
young
ladies
asked
mrs
moffat
lumbering
in
like
an
elephant
in
silk
and
lace
no
thank
you
ma'am
replied
sallie
i've
got
my
new
pink
silk
for
thursday
and
don't
want
a
thing
nor
i,--
began
meg
but
stopped
because
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
_did_
want
several
things
and
could
not
have
them
what
shall
you
wear
asked
sallie
my
old
white
one
again
if
i
can
mend
it
fit
to
be
seen
it
got
sadly
torn
last
night
said
meg
trying
to
speak
quite
easily
but
feeling
very
uncomfortable
why
don't
you
send
home
for
another
said
sallie
who
was
not
an
observing
young
lady
i
haven't
got
any
other
it
cost
meg
an
effort
to
say
that
but
sallie
did
not
see
it
and
exclaimed
in
amiable
surprise,--
only
that
how
funny--
she
did
not
finish
her
speech
for
belle
shook
her
head
at
her
and
broke
in
saying
kindly,--
not
at
all
where
is
the
use
of
having
a
lot
of
dresses
when
she
isn't
out
there's
no
need
of
sending
home
daisy
even
if
you
had
a
dozen
for
i've
got
a
sweet
blue
silk
laid
away
which
i've
outgrown
and
you
shall
wear
it
to
please
me
won't
you
dear
you
are
very
kind
but
i
don't
mind
my
old
dress
if
you
don't
it
does
well
enough
for
a
little
girl
like
me
said
meg
now
do
let
me
please
myself
by
dressing
you
up
in
style
i
admire
to
do
it
and
you'd
be
a
regular
little
beauty
with
a
touch
here
and
there
i
sha'n't
let
any
one
see
you
till
you
are
done
and
then
we'll
burst
upon
them
like
cinderella
and
her
godmother
going
to
the
ball
said
belle
in
her
persuasive
tone
meg
couldn't
refuse
the
offer
so
kindly
made
for
a
desire
to
see
if
she
would
be
a
little
beauty
after
touching
up
caused
her
to
accept
and
forget
all
her
former
uncomfortable
feelings
towards
the
moffats
on
the
thursday
evening
belle
shut
herself
up
with
her
maid
and
between
them
they
turned
meg
into
a
fine
lady
they
crimped
and
curled
her
hair
they
polished
her
neck
and
arms
with
some
fragrant
powder
touched
her
lips
with
coralline
salve
to
make
them
redder
and
hortense
would
have
added
a
_soupçon_
of
rouge
if
meg
had
not
rebelled
they
laced
her
into
a
sky-blue
dress
which
was
so
tight
she
could
hardly
breathe
and
so
low
in
the
neck
that
modest
meg
blushed
at
herself
in
the
mirror
a
set
of
silver
filagree
was
added
bracelets
necklace
brooch
and
even
ear-rings
for
hortense
tied
them
on
with
a
bit
of
pink
silk
which
did
not
show
a
cluster
of
tea-rosebuds
at
the
bosom
and
a
_ruche_
reconciled
meg
to
the
display
of
her
pretty
white
shoulders
and
a
pair
of
high-heeled
blue
silk
boots
satisfied
the
last
wish
of
her
heart
a
laced
handkerchief
a
plumy
fan
and
a
bouquet
in
a
silver
holder
finished
her
off
and
miss
belle
surveyed
her
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
little
girl
with
a
newly
dressed
doll
mademoiselle
is
charmante
très
jolie
is
she
not
cried
hortense
clasping
her
hands
in
an
affected
rapture
come
and
show
yourself
said
miss
belle
leading
the
way
to
the
room
where
the
others
were
waiting
as
meg
went
rustling
after
with
her
long
skirts
trailing
her
ear-rings
tinkling
her
curls
waving
and
her
heart
beating
she
felt
as
if
her
fun
had
really
begun
at
last
for
the
mirror
had
plainly
told
her
that
she
_was_
a
little
beauty
her
friends
repeated
the
pleasing
phrase
enthusiastically
and
for
several
minutes
she
stood
like
the
jackdaw
in
the
fable
enjoying
her
borrowed
plumes
while
the
rest
chattered
like
a
party
of
magpies
while
i
dress
do
you
drill
her
nan
in
the
management
of
her
skirt
and
those
french
heels
or
she
will
trip
herself
up
take
your
silver
butterfly
and
catch
up
that
long
curl
on
the
left
side
of
her
head
clara
and
don't
any
of
you
disturb
the
charming
work
of
my
hands
said
belle
as
she
hurried
away
looking
well
pleased
with
her
success
i'm
afraid
to
go
down
i
feel
so
queer
and
stiff
and
half-dressed
said
meg
to
sallie
as
the
bell
rang
and
mrs
moffat
sent
to
ask
the
young
ladies
to
appear
at
once
you
don't
look
a
bit
like
yourself
but
you
are
very
nice
i'm
nowhere
beside
you
for
belle
has
heaps
of
taste
and
you're
quite
french
i
assure
you
let
your
flowers
hang
don't
be
so
careful
of
them
and
be
sure
you
don't
trip
returned
sallie
trying
not
to
care
that
meg
was
prettier
than
herself
illustration
asked
to
be
introduced
keeping
that
warning
carefully
in
mind
margaret
got
safely
down
stairs
and
sailed
into
the
drawing-rooms
where
the
moffats
and
a
few
early
guests
were
assembled
she
very
soon
discovered
that
there
is
a
charm
about
fine
clothes
which
attracts
a
certain
class
of
people
and
secures
their
respect
several
young
ladies
who
had
taken
no
notice
of
her
before
were
very
affectionate
all
of
a
sudden
several
young
gentlemen
who
had
only
stared
at
her
at
the
other
party
now
not
only
stared
but
asked
to
be
introduced
and
said
all
manner
of
foolish
but
agreeable
things
to
her
and
several
old
ladies
who
sat
on
sofas
and
criticised
the
rest
of
the
party
inquired
who
she
was
with
an
air
of
interest
she
heard
mrs
moffat
reply
to
one
of
them,--
daisy
march--father
a
colonel
in
the
army--one
of
our
first
families
but
reverses
of
fortune
you
know
intimate
friends
of
the
laurences
sweet
creature
i
assure
you
my
ned
is
quite
wild
about
her
dear
me
said
the
old
lady
putting
up
her
glass
for
another
observation
of
meg
who
tried
to
look
as
if
she
had
not
heard
and
been
rather
shocked
at
mrs
moffat's
fibs
the
queer
feeling
did
not
pass
away
but
she
imagined
herself
acting
the
new
part
of
fine
lady
and
so
got
on
pretty
well
though
the
tight
dress
gave
her
a
side-ache
the
train
kept
getting
under
her
feet
and
she
was
in
constant
fear
lest
her
ear-rings
should
fly
off
and
get
lost
or
broken
she
was
flirting
her
fan
and
laughing
at
the
feeble
jokes
of
a
young
gentleman
who
tried
to
be
witty
when
she
suddenly
stopped
laughing
and
looked
confused
for
just
opposite
she
saw
laurie
he
was
staring
at
her
with
undisguised
surprise
and
disapproval
also
she
thought
for
though
he
bowed
and
smiled
yet
something
in
his
honest
eyes
made
her
blush
and
wish
she
had
her
old
dress
on
to
complete
her
confusion
she
saw
belle
nudge
annie
and
both
glance
from
her
to
laurie
who
she
was
happy
to
see
looked
unusually
boyish
and
shy
silly
creatures
to
put
such
thoughts
into
my
head
i
won't
care
for
it
or
let
it
change
me
a
bit
thought
meg
and
rustled
across
the
room
to
shake
hands
with
her
friend
i'm
glad
you
came
i
was
afraid
you
wouldn't
she
said
with
her
most
grown-up
air
jo
wanted
me
to
come
and
tell
her
how
you
looked
so
i
did
answered
laurie
without
turning
his
eyes
upon
her
though
he
half
smiled
at
her
maternal
tone
what
shall
you
tell
her
asked
meg
full
of
curiosity
to
know
his
opinion
of
her
yet
feeling
ill
at
ease
with
him
for
the
first
time
i
shall
say
i
didn't
know
you
for
you
look
so
grown-up
and
unlike
yourself
i'm
quite
afraid
of
you
he
said
fumbling
at
his
glove-button
how
absurd
of
you
the
girls
dressed
me
up
for
fun
and
i
rather
like
it
wouldn't
jo
stare
if
she
saw
me
said
meg
bent
on
making
him
say
whether
he
thought
her
improved
or
not
yes
i
think
she
would
returned
laurie
gravely
don't
you
like
me
so
asked
meg
no
i
don't
was
the
blunt
reply
why
not
in
an
anxious
tone
he
glanced
at
her
frizzled
head
bare
shoulders
and
fantastically
trimmed
dress
with
an
expression
that
abashed
her
more
than
his
answer
which
had
not
a
particle
of
his
usual
politeness
about
it
i
don't
like
fuss
and
feathers
that
was
altogether
too
much
from
a
lad
younger
than
herself
and
meg
walked
away
saying
petulantly,--
you
are
the
rudest
boy
i
ever
saw
feeling
very
much
ruffled
she
went
and
stood
at
a
quiet
window
to
cool
her
cheeks
for
the
tight
dress
gave
her
an
uncomfortably
brilliant
color
as
she
stood
there
major
lincoln
passed
by
and
a
minute
after
she
heard
him
saying
to
his
mother,--
they
are
making
a
fool
of
that
little
girl
i
wanted
you
to
see
her
but
they
have
spoilt
her
entirely
she's
nothing
but
a
doll
to-night
oh
dear
sighed
meg
i
wish
i'd
been
sensible
and
worn
my
own
things
then
i
should
not
have
disgusted
other
people
or
felt
so
uncomfortable
and
ashamed
myself
she
leaned
her
forehead
on
the
cool
pane
and
stood
half
hidden
by
the
curtains
never
minding
that
her
favorite
waltz
had
begun
till
some
one
touched
her
and
turning
she
saw
laurie
looking
penitent
as
he
said
with
his
very
best
bow
and
his
hand
out,--
please
forgive
my
rudeness
and
come
and
dance
with
me
i'm
afraid
it
will
be
too
disagreeable
to
you
said
meg
trying
to
look
offended
and
failing
entirely
not
a
bit
of
it
i'm
dying
to
do
it
come
i'll
be
good
i
don't
like
your
gown
but
i
do
think
you
are--just
splendid
and
he
waved
his
hands
as
if
words
failed
to
express
his
admiration
meg
smiled
and
relented
and
whispered
as
they
stood
waiting
to
catch
the
time,--
take
care
my
skirt
don't
trip
you
up
it's
the
plague
of
my
life
and
i
was
a
goose
to
wear
it
pin
it
round
your
neck
and
then
it
will
be
useful
said
laurie
looking
down
at
the
little
blue
boots
which
he
evidently
approved
of
away
they
went
fleetly
and
gracefully
for
having
practised
at
home
they
were
well
matched
and
the
blithe
young
couple
were
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
as
they
twirled
merrily
round
and
round
feeling
more
friendly
than
ever
after
their
small
tiff
laurie
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
will
you
said
meg
as
he
stood
fanning
her
when
her
breath
gave
out
which
it
did
very
soon
though
she
would
not
own
why
won't
i
said
laurie
with
alacrity
please
don't
tell
them
at
home
about
my
dress
to-night
they
won't
understand
the
joke
and
it
will
worry
mother
then
why
did
you
do
it
said
laurie's
eyes
so
plainly
that
meg
hastily
added,--
i
shall
tell
them
myself
all
about
it
and
''fess'
to
mother
how
silly
i've
been
but
i'd
rather
do
it
myself
so
you'll
not
tell
will
you
i
give
you
my
word
i
won't
only
what
shall
i
say
when
they
ask
me
just
say
i
looked
pretty
well
and
was
having
a
good
time
i'll
say
the
first
with
all
my
heart
but
how
about
the
other
you
don't
look
as
if
you
were
having
a
good
time
are
you
and
laurie
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
which
made
her
answer
in
a
whisper,--
no
not
just
now
don't
think
i'm
horrid
i
only
wanted
a
little
fun
but
this
sort
doesn't
pay
i
find
and
i'm
getting
tired
of
it
here
comes
ned
moffat
what
does
he
want
said
laurie
knitting
his
black
brows
as
if
he
did
not
regard
his
young
host
in
the
light
of
a
pleasant
addition
to
the
party
he
put
his
name
down
for
three
dances
and
i
suppose
he's
coming
for
them
what
a
bore
said
meg
assuming
a
languid
air
which
amused
laurie
immensely
he
did
not
speak
to
her
again
till
supper-time
when
he
saw
her
drinking
champagne
with
ned
and
his
friend
fisher
who
were
behaving
like
a
pair
of
fools
as
laurie
said
to
himself
for
he
felt
a
brotherly
sort
of
right
to
watch
over
the
marches
and
fight
their
battles
whenever
a
defender
was
needed
illustration
i
wouldn't
meg
you'll
have
a
splitting
headache
to-morrow
if
you
drink
much
of
that
i
wouldn't
meg
your
mother
doesn't
like
it
you
know
he
whispered
leaning
over
her
chair
as
ned
turned
to
refill
her
glass
and
fisher
stooped
to
pick
up
her
fan
i'm
not
meg
to-night
i'm
'a
doll,'
who
does
all
sorts
of
crazy
things
to-morrow
i
shall
put
away
my
'fuss
and
feathers,'
and
be
desperately
good
again
she
answered
with
an
affected
little
laugh
wish
to-morrow
was
here
then
muttered
laurie
walking
off
ill-pleased
at
the
change
he
saw
in
her
meg
danced
and
flirted
chattered
and
giggled
as
the
other
girls
did
after
supper
she
undertook
the
german
and
blundered
through
it
nearly
upsetting
her
partner
with
her
long
skirt
and
romping
in
a
way
that
scandalized
laurie
who
looked
on
and
meditated
a
lecture
but
he
got
no
chance
to
deliver
it
for
meg
kept
away
from
him
till
he
came
to
say
good-night
remember
she
said
trying
to
smile
for
the
splitting
headache
had
already
begun
silence
à
la
mort
replied
laurie
with
a
melodramatic
flourish
as
he
went
away
this
little
bit
of
by-play
excited
annie's
curiosity
but
meg
was
too
tired
for
gossip
and
went
to
bed
feeling
as
if
she
had
been
to
a
masquerade
and
hadn't
enjoyed
herself
as
much
as
she
expected
she
was
sick
all
the
next
day
and
on
saturday
went
home
quite
used
up
with
her
fortnight's
fun
and
feeling
that
she
had
sat
in
the
lap
of
luxury
long
enough
it
does
seem
pleasant
to
be
quiet
and
not
have
company
manners
on
all
the
time
home
_is_
a
nice
place
though
it
isn't
splendid
said
meg
looking
about
her
with
a
restful
expression
as
she
sat
with
her
mother
and
jo
on
the
sunday
evening
i'm
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
dear
for
i
was
afraid
home
would
seem
dull
and
poor
to
you
after
your
fine
quarters
replied
her
mother
who
had
given
her
many
anxious
looks
that
day
for
motherly
eyes
are
quick
to
see
any
change
in
children's
faces
meg
had
told
her
adventures
gayly
and
said
over
and
over
what
a
charming
time
she
had
had
but
something
still
seemed
to
weigh
upon
her
spirits
and
when
the
younger
girls
were
gone
to
bed
she
sat
thoughtfully
staring
at
the
fire
saying
little
and
looking
worried
as
the
clock
struck
nine
and
jo
proposed
bed
meg
suddenly
left
her
chair
and
taking
beth's
stool
leaned
her
elbows
on
her
mother's
knee
saying
bravely,--
marmee
i
want
to
''fess.'
i
thought
so
what
is
it
dear
shall
i
go
away
asked
jo
discreetly
of
course
not
don't
i
always
tell
you
everything
i
was
ashamed
to
speak
of
it
before
the
children
but
i
want
you
to
know
all
the
dreadful
things
i
did
at
the
moffat's
we
are
prepared
said
mrs
march
smiling
but
looking
a
little
anxious
i
told
you
they
dressed
me
up
but
i
didn't
tell
you
that
they
powdered
and
squeezed
and
frizzled
and
made
me
look
like
a
fashion-plate
laurie
thought
i
wasn't
proper
i
know
he
did
though
he
didn't
say
so
and
one
man
called
me
'a
doll.'
i
knew
it
was
silly
but
they
flattered
me
and
said
i
was
a
beauty
and
quantities
of
nonsense
so
i
let
them
make
a
fool
of
me
is
that
all
asked
jo
as
mrs
march
looked
silently
at
the
downcast
face
of
her
pretty
daughter
and
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
blame
her
little
follies
no
i
drank
champagne
and
romped
and
tried
to
flirt
and
was
altogether
abominable
said
meg
self-reproachfully
there
is
something
more
i
think
and
mrs
march
smoothed
the
soft
cheek
which
suddenly
grew
rosy
as
meg
answered
slowly,--
yes
it's
very
silly
but
i
want
to
tell
it
because
i
hate
to
have
people
say
and
think
such
things
about
us
and
laurie
then
she
told
the
various
bits
of
gossip
she
had
heard
at
the
moffats
and
as
she
spoke
jo
saw
her
mother
fold
her
lips
tightly
as
if
ill
pleased
that
such
ideas
should
be
put
into
meg's
innocent
mind
well
if
that
isn't
the
greatest
rubbish
i
ever
heard
cried
jo
indignantly
why
didn't
you
pop
out
and
tell
them
so
on
the
spot
i
couldn't
it
was
so
embarrassing
for
me
i
couldn't
help
hearing
at
first
and
then
i
was
so
angry
and
ashamed
i
didn't
remember
that
i
ought
to
go
away
just
wait
till
_i_
see
annie
moffat
and
i'll
show
you
how
to
settle
such
ridiculous
stuff
the
idea

he's
rich

may

and
by
won't

shout
when
i
tell
him
what
those
silly
things
say
about
us
poor
children
and
jo
laughed
as
if
on
second
thoughts
the
thing
struck
her
as
a
good
joke

you
tell
laurie
i'll
never
forgive
you

mustn't
must

mother
said
meg
looking
distressed
no
never
repeat
that
foolish
gossip
and
forget
it
as
soon
as
you
can
said
mrs
march
gravely
i
was
very
unwise
to
let
you
go
among
people
of
whom
i
know
so
little,--kind
i
dare
say
but
worldly
ill-bred
and
full
of
these
vulgar
ideas
about
young
people
i
am
more
sorry
than
i
can
express
for
the
mischief
this
visit
may
have
done
you
meg
don't
be
sorry
i
won't
let
it
hurt
me
i'll
forget
all
the
bad
and
remember
only
the
good
for
i
did
enjoy
a
great
deal
and
thank
you
very
much
for
letting
me
go
i'll
not
be
sentimental
or
dissatisfied
mother
i
know
i'm
a
silly
little
girl
and
i'll
stay
with
you
till
i'm
fit
to
take
care
of
myself
but
it
_is_
nice
to
be
praised
and
admired
and
i
can't
help
saying
i
like
it
said
meg
looking
half
ashamed
of
the
confession
that
is
perfectly
natural
and
quite
harmless
if
the
liking
does
not
become
a
passion
and
lead
one
to
do
foolish
or
unmaidenly
things
learn
to
know
and
value
the
praise
which
is
worth
having
and
to
excite
the
admiration
of
excellent
people
by
being
modest
as
well
as
pretty
meg
margaret
sat
thinking
a
moment
while
jo
stood
with
her
hands
behind
her
looking
both
interested
and
a
little
perplexed
for
it
was
a
new
thing
to
see
meg
blushing
and
talking
about
admiration
lovers
and
things
of
that
sort
and
jo
felt
as
if
during
that
fortnight
her
sister
had
grown
up
amazingly
and
was
drifting
away
from
her
into
a
world
where
she
could
not
follow
mother
do
you
have
'plans,'
as
mrs
moffat
said
asked
meg
bashfully
yes
my
dear
i
have
a
great
many
all
mothers
do
but
mine
differ
somewhat
from
mrs
moffat's
i
suspect
i
will
tell
you
some
of
them
for
the
time
has
come
when
a
word
may
set
this
romantic
little
head
and
heart
of
yours
right
on
a
very
serious
subject
you
are
young
meg
but
not
too
young
to
understand
me
and
mothers'
lips
are
the
fittest
to
speak
of
such
things
to
girls
like
you
jo
your
turn
will
come
in
time
perhaps
so
listen
to
my
'plans,'
and
help
me
carry
them
out
if
they
are
good
jo
went
and
sat
on
one
arm
of
the
chair
looking
as
if
she
thought
they
were
about
to
join
in
some
very
solemn
affair
holding
a
hand
of
each
and
watching
the
two
young
faces

serious

cheery
way,--

&c
i
want
my

to

beautiful
accomplished

good

have
a
happy
youth
to
be
well

wisely

to
lead
useful
pleasant
lives
with
as
little
care
and
sorrow
to
try
them
as
god
sees
fit
to
send
to
be
loved
and
chosen
by
a
good
man
is
the
best
and
sweetest
thing
which
can
happen
to
a
woman
and
i
sincerely
hope
my
girls
may
know
this
beautiful
experience
it
is
natural
to
think
of
it
meg
right
to
hope
and
wait
for
it
and
wise
to
prepare
for
it
so
that
when
the
happy
time
comes
you
may
feel
ready
for
the
duties
and
worthy
of
the
joy
my
dear
girls
i
_am_
ambitious
for
you
but
not
to
have
you
make
a
dash
in
the
world,--marry
rich
men
merely
because
they
are
rich
or
have
splendid
houses
which
are
not
homes
because
love
is
wanting
money
is
a
needful
and
precious
thing,--and
when
well
used
a
noble
thing,--but
i
never
want
you
to
think
it
is
the
first
or
only
prize
to
strive
for
i'd
rather
see
you
poor
men's
wives
if
you
were
happy
beloved
contented
than
queens
on
thrones
without
self-respect
and
peace
poor
girls
don't
stand
any
chance
belle
says
unless
they
put
themselves
forward
sighed
meg
then
we'll
be
old
maids
said
jo
stoutly
right
jo
better
be
happy
old
maids
than
unhappy
wives
or
unmaidenly
girls
running
about
to
find
husbands
said
mrs

decidedly
don't
be
troubled
meg
poverty
seldom
daunts
a
sincere
lover
some
of
the
best
and
most
honored
women
i
know
were
poor
girls
but
so
love-worthy
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
be
old
maids
leave
these
things
to
time
make
this
home
happy
so
that
you
may
be
fit
for
homes
of
your
own
if
they
are
offered
you
and
contented
here
if
they
are

one

remember
my

mother
is
always
ready
to
be
your
confidant

to
be
your

and
both
of

trust

on

new
set
of
amusements
became
the
fashion
and
the
lengthening
days
gave
long
afternoons
for
work
and
play
of
all
sorts
the
garden
had
to
be
put
in
order

had
a
quarter
of

little
plot

roses
and
heliotrope
myrtle
and
a
little
orange-tree
in
it
jo's
bed
was
never
alike
two
seasons
for
she
was
always
trying
experiments
this
year
it
was
to
be
a
plantation
of
sun-flowers
the
seeds
of
which
cheerful
and
aspiring
plant
were
to
feed

and
her
family
of

old-fashioned
fragrant
flowers
in

garden,--sweet
peas
and
mignonette
larkspur
pinks
pansies
and
southernwood
with
chickweed
for
the
bird
and
catnip
for
the
pussies
amy
had
a
bower
in
hers,--rather
small
and
earwiggy
but
very
pretty
to
look
at,--with
honeysuckles
and
morning-glories
hanging
their
colored
horns
and
bells
in
graceful
wreaths
all
over
it
tall
white
lilies
delicate
ferns
and
as
many
brilliant
picturesque
plants
as
would
consent
to
blossom
there
gardening
walks
rows
on
the
river
and
flower-hunts
employed
the
fine
days
and
for
rainy
ones
they
had
house
diversions,--some
old
some
new,--all
more
or
less
original
one
of
these
was
the
p

for
as
secret
societies
were
the
fashion
it
was
thought
proper
to
have

and
as
all
of
the
girls
admired
dickens
they
called
themselves
the
pickwick
club
with
a
few
interruptions
they
had
kept
this
up
for
a
year
and
met
every
saturday

contributed

o'clock

ascended

asked
a
gallant
troubadour
of
the
fairy
queen
who
floated
down
the
hall
upon
his
arm
yes
is
she
not
lovely
though
so
sad
her
dress
is
well
chosen
too
for
in
a
week
she
weds
count
antonio
whom
she
passionately
hates
by
my
faith
i
envy
him
yonder
he
comes
arrayed
like
a
bridegroom
except
the
black
mask
when
that
is
off
we
shall
see
how
he
regards
the
fair
maid
whose
heart
he
cannot
win
though
her
stern
father
bestows
her
hand
returned
the
troubadour
'tis
whispered
that
she
loves
the
young
english
artist
who
haunts
her
steps
and
is
spurned
by
the
old
count
said
the
lady
as
they
joined
the
dance
the
revel
was
at
its
height
when
a
priest
appeared
and
withdrawing
the
young
pair
to
an
alcove
hung
with
purple
velvet
he
motioned
them
to
kneel
instant
silence
fell
upon
the
gay
throng
and
not
a
sound
but
the
dash
of
fountains
or
the
rustle
of
orange-groves
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
broke
the
hush
as
count
de
adelon
spoke
thus:--
my
lords
and
ladies
pardon
the
ruse
by
which
i
have
gathered
you
here
to
witness
the
marriage
of
my
daughter
father
we
wait
your
services
all
eyes
turned
toward
the
bridal
party
and
a
low
murmur
of
amazement
went
through
the
throng
for
neither
bride
nor
groom
removed
their
masks
curiosity
and
wonder
possessed
all
hearts
but
respect
restrained
all
tongues
till
the
holy
rite
was
over
then
the
eager
spectators
gathered
round
the
count
demanding
an
explanation
gladly
would
i
give
it
if
i
could
but
i
only
know
that
it
was
the
whim
of
my
timid
viola
and
i
yielded
to
it
now
my
children
let
the
play
end
unmask
and
receive
my
blessing
but
neither
bent
the
knee
for
the
young
bridegroom
replied
in
a
tone
that
startled
all
listeners
as
the
mask
fell
disclosing
the
noble
face
of
ferdinand
devereux
the
artist
lover
and
leaning
on
the
breast
where
now
flashed
the
star
of
an
english
earl
was
the
lovely
viola
radiant
with
joy
and
beauty
my
lord
you
scornfully
bade
me
claim
your
daughter
when
i
could
boast
as
high
a
name
and
vast
a
fortune
as
the
count
antonio
i
can
do
more
for
even
your
ambitious
soul
cannot
refuse
the
earl
of
devereux
and
de
vere
when
he
gives
his
ancient
name
and
boundless
wealth
in
return
for
the
beloved
hand
of
this
fair
lady
now
my
wife
the
count
stood
like
one
changed
to
stone
and
turning
to
the
bewildered
crowd
ferdinand
added
with
a
gay
smile
of
triumph
to
you
my
gallant
friends
i
can
only
wish
that
your
wooing
may
prosper
as
mine
has
done

of

mr

_sir_:--
i
address
you
upon
the
subject
of
sin
the
sinner
i
mean
is
a
man
named
winkle
who
makes
trouble
in
his
club
by
laughing
and
sometimes
won't
write
his
piece
in
this
fine
paper
i
hope
you
will
pardon
his
badness
and
let
him
send
a
french
fable
because
he
can't
write
out
of
his
head
as
he
has
so
many
lessons
to
do
and
no
brains
in

i
will
try
to
take
time
by
the
fetlock

upon

the

as
the

finished
reading
the
paper
which
i
beg
leave
to
assure
my
readers
is
a
_bona
fide_
copy
of
one
written
by
_bona
fide_
girls
once
upon
a
time
a
round
of
applause
followed
and
then
mr
snodgrass
rose
to
make
a
proposition
mr
president
and
gentlemen
he
began
assuming
a
parliamentary
attitude
and
tone
i
wish
to
propose
the
admission
of
a
new
member,--one
who
highly
deserves
the
honor
would
be
deeply
grateful
for
it
and
would
add
immensely
to
the
spirit
of
the
club
the
literary
value
of
the
paper
and
be
no
end
jolly
and
nice
i
propose
mr
theodore
laurence
as
an
honorary
member
of
the
p
c
come
now
do
have
him
jo's
sudden
change
of
tone
made
the
girls
laugh
but
all
looked
rather
anxious
and
no
one
said
a
word
as
snodgrass
took
his
seat
we'll
put
it
to
vote
said
the
president
all
in
favor
of
this
motion
please
to
manifest
it
by
saying
'ay.'
a
loud
response
from
snodgrass
followed
to
everybody's
surprise
by
a
timid
one
from
beth
contrary
minded
say
'no.'
meg
and
amy
were
contrary
minded
and
mr
winkle
rose
to
say
with
great
elegance
we
don't
wish
any
boys
they
only
joke
and
bounce
about
this
is
a
ladies'
club
and
we
wish
to
be
private
and
proper
i'm
afraid
he'll
laugh
at
our
paper
and
make
fun
of
us
afterward
observed
pickwick
pulling
the
little
curl
on
her
forehead
as
she
always
did
when
doubtful
up
rose
snodgrass
very
much
in
earnest
sir
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
gentleman
laurie
won't
do
anything
of
the
sort
he
likes
to
write
and
he'll
give
a
tone
to
our
contributions
and
keep
us
from
being
sentimental
don't
you
see
we
can
do
so
little
for
him
and
he
does
so
much
for
us
i
think
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
offer
him
a
place
here
and
make
him
welcome
if
he
comes
this
artful
allusion
to
benefits
conferred
brought
tupman
to
his
feet
looking
as
if
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
yes
we
ought
to
do
it
even
if
we
_are_
afraid
i
say
he
_may_
come
and
his
grandpa
too
if
he
likes
this
spirited
burst
from
beth
electrified
the
club
and
jo
left
her
seat
to
shake
hands
approvingly
now
then
vote
again
everybody
remember
it's
our
laurie
and
say
'ay!'
cried
snodgrass
excitedly
ay
ay
ay
replied
three
voices
at
once
good
bless
you
now
as
there's
nothing
like
'taking
time
by
the
_fetlock_,'
as
winkle
characteristically
observes
allow
me
to
present
the
new
member
and
to
the
dismay
of
the
rest
of
the
club
jo
threw
open
the
door
of
the
closet
and
displayed
laurie
sitting
on
a
rag-bag
flushed
and
twinkling
with
suppressed
laughter
illustration
jo
threw
open
the
door
of
the
closet
you
rogue
you
traitor
jo
how
could
you
cried
the
three
girls
as
snodgrass
led
her
friend
triumphantly
forth
and
producing
both
a
chair
and
a
badge
installed
him
in
a
jiffy
the
coolness
of
you
two
rascals
is
amazing
began
mr
pickwick
trying
to
get
up
an
awful
frown
and
only
succeeding
in
producing
an
amiable
smile
but
the
new
member
was
equal
to
the
occasion
and
rising
with
a
grateful
salutation
to
the
chair
said
in
the
most
engaging
manner
mr
president
and
ladies,--i
beg
pardon
gentlemen,--allow
me
to
introduce
myself
as
sam
weller
the
very
humble
servant
of
the
club
good
good
cried
jo
pounding
with
the
handle
of
the
old
warming-pan
on
which
she
leaned
my
faithful
friend
and
noble
patron
continued
laurie
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
who
has
so
flatteringly
presented
me
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
the
base
stratagem
of
to-night
i
planned
it
and
she
only
gave
in
after
lots
of
teasing
come
now
don't
lay
it
all
on
yourself
you
know
i
proposed
the
cupboard
broke
in
snodgrass
who
was
enjoying
the
joke
amazingly
never
you
mind
what
she
says
i'm
the
wretch
that
did
it
sir
said
the
new
member
with
a
welleresque
nod
to
mr
pickwick
but
on
my
honor
i
never
will
do
so
again
and
henceforth
_dewote_
myself
to
the
interest
of
this
immortal
club
hear
hear
cried
jo
clashing
the
lid
of
the
warming-pan
like
a
cymbal
go
on
go
on
added
winkle
and
tupman
while
the
president
bowed
benignly
i
merely
wish
to
say
that
as
a
slight
token
of
my
gratitude
for
the
honor
done
me
and
as
a
means
of
promoting
friendly
relations
between
adjoining
nations
i
have
set
up
a
post-office
in
the
hedge
in
the
lower
corner
of
the
garden
a
fine
spacious
building
with
padlocks
on
the
doors
and
every
convenience
for
the
mails,--also
the
females
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
it's
the
old
martin-house
but
i've
stopped
up
the
door
and
made
the
roof
open
so
it
will
hold
all
sorts
of
things
and
save
our
valuable
time
letters
manuscripts
books
and
bundles
can
be
passed
in
there
and
as
each
nation
has
a
key
it
will
be
uncommonly
nice
i
fancy
allow
me
to
present
the
club
key
and
with
many
thanks
for
your
favor
take
my
seat
great
applause
as
mr
weller
deposited
a
little
key
on
the
table
and
subsided
the
warming-pan
clashed
and
waved
wildly
and
it
was
some
time
before
order
could
be
restored
a
long
discussion
followed
and
every
one
came
out
surprising
for
every
one
did
her
best
so
it
was
an
unusually
lively
meeting
and
did
not
adjourn
till
a
late
hour
when
it
broke
up
with
three
shrill
cheers
for
the
new
member
no
one
ever
regretted
the
admittance
of
sam
weller
for
a
more
devoted
well-behaved
and
jovial
member
no
club
could
have
he
certainly
did
add
spirit
to
the
meetings
and
a
tone
to
the
paper
for
his
orations
convulsed
his
hearers
and
his
contributions
were
excellent
being
patriotic
classical
comical
or
dramatic
but
never
sentimental
jo
regarded
them
as
worthy
of
bacon
milton
or
shakespeare
and
remodelled
her
own
works
with
good
effect
she
thought
the
p
o
was
a
capital
little
institution
and
flourished
wonderfully
for
nearly
as
many
queer
things
passed
through
it
as
through
the
real
office
tragedies
and
cravats
poetry
and
pickles
garden-seeds
and
long
letters
music
and
gingerbread
rubbers
invitations
scoldings
and
puppies
the
old
gentleman
liked
the
fun
and
amused
himself
by
sending
odd
bundles
mysterious
messages
and
funny
telegrams
and
his
gardener
who
was
smitten
with
hannah's
charms
actually
sent
a
love-letter
to
jo's
care
how
they
laughed
when
the
secret
came
out
never
dreaming
how
many
love-letters
that
little
post-office
would
hold
in
the
years
to
come

to-morrow
and
i'm
free
three
months'
vacation,--how
i
shall
enjoy
it
exclaimed
meg
coming
home
one
warm
day
to
find
jo
laid
upon
the
sofa
in
an
unusual
state
of
exhaustion
while
beth
took
off
her
dusty
boots
and
amy
made
lemonade
for
the
refreshment
of
the
whole
party
aunt
march
went
to-day
for
which
oh
be
joyful
said
jo
i
was
mortally
afraid
she'd
ask
me
to
go
with
her
if
she
had
i
should
have
felt
as
if
i
ought
to
do
it
but
plumfield
is
about
as
gay
as
a
churchyard
you
know
and
i'd
rather
be
excused
we
had
a
flurry
getting
the
old
lady
off
and
i
had
a
fright
every
time
she
spoke
to
me
for
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
through
that
i
was
uncommonly
helpful
and
sweet
and
feared
she'd
find
it
impossible
to
part
from
me
i
quaked
till
she
was
fairly
in
the
carriage
and
had
a
final
fright
for
as
it
drove
off
she
popped
out
her
head
saying
'josy-phine
won't
you--?'
i
didn't
hear
any
more
for
i
basely
turned
and
fled
i
did
actually
run
and
whisked
round
the
corner
where
i
felt
safe
poor
old
jo
she
came
in
looking
as
if
bears
were
after
her
said
beth
as
she
cuddled
her
sister's
feet
with
a
motherly
air
aunt
march
is
a
regular
samphire
is
she
not
observed
amy
tasting
her
mixture
critically
she
means
_vampire_
not
sea-weed
but
it
doesn't
matter
it's
too
warm
to
be
particular
about
one's
parts
of
speech
murmured
jo
what
shall
you
do
all
your
vacation
asked
amy
changing
the
subject
with
tact
i
shall
lie
abed
late
and
do
nothing
replied
meg
from
the
depths
of
the
rocking-chair
i've
been
routed
up
early
all
winter
and
had
to
spend
my
days
working
for
other
people
so
now
i'm
going
to
rest
and
revel
to
my
heart's
content
no
said
jo
that
dozy
way
wouldn't
suit
me
i've
laid
in
a
heap
of
books
and
i'm
going
to
improve
my
shining
hours
reading
on
my
perch
in
the

apple-tree

don't
say
'larks!'
implored
amy
as
a
return
snub
for
the
samphire
correction
i'll
say
'nightingales,'
then
with
laurie
that's
proper
and
appropriate
since
he's
a
warbler
don't
let
us
do
any
lessons
beth
for
a
while
but
play
all
the
time
and
rest
as
the
girls
mean
to
proposed
amy
well
i
will
if

doesn't
mind
i
want
to
learn
some
new

my

up

they
are
dreadfully
out

and
really
suffering
for
clothes
may
we
mother
asked
meg
turning
to
mrs
march
who
sat
sewing
in
what
they
called
marmee's
corner
you
may
try
your
experiment
for
a
week
and
see
how
you
like
it
i
think
by
saturday
night
you
will
find
that
all
play
and
no
work
is
as
bad
as
all
work
and
no
play
oh
dear
no
it
will
be
delicious
i'm
sure
said
meg
complacently
i
now
propose
a
toast
as
my
'friend
and
pardner
sairy
gamp,'
says
fun
forever
and
no
grubbing
cried
jo
rising
glass
in
hand
as
the
lemonade
went
round
they
all
drank
it
merrily
and
began
the
experiment
by
lounging
for
the
rest
of
the
day
next
morning
meg
did
not
appear
till
ten
o'clock
her
solitary
breakfast
did
not
taste
nice
and
the
room
seemed
lonely
and
untidy
for
jo
had
not
filled
the
vases
beth
had
not
dusted
and
amy's
books
lay
scattered
about
nothing
was
neat
and
pleasant
but
marmee's
corner
which
looked
as
usual
and
there
meg
sat
to
rest
and
read
which
meant
yawn
and
imagine
what
pretty
summer
dresses
she
would
get
with
her
salary
jo
spent
the
morning
on
the
river
with
laurie
and
the
afternoon
reading
and
crying
over
the
wide
wide
world
up
in
the
apple-tree
beth
began
by
rummaging
everything
out
of
the
big
closet
where
her
family
resided
but
getting
tired
before
half
done
she
left
her
establishment
topsy-turvy
and
went
to
her
music
rejoicing
that
she
had
no
dishes
to
wash
amy
arranged
her
bower
put
on
her
best
white
frock
smoothed
her
curls
and
sat
down
to
draw
under
the
honeysuckles
hoping
some
one
would
see
and
inquire
who
the
young
artist
was
as
no
one
appeared
but
an
inquisitive
daddy-long-legs
who
examined
her
work
with
interest
she
went
to
walk
got
caught
in
a
shower
and
came
home
dripping
illustration
amy
sat
down
to
draw
at
tea-time
they
compared
notes
and
all
agreed
that
it
had
been
a
delightful
though
unusually
long
day
meg
who
went
shopping
in
the
afternoon
and
got
a
sweet
blue
muslin
had
discovered
after
she
had
cut
the
breadths
off
that
it
wouldn't
wash
which
mishap
made
her
slightly
cross
jo
had
burnt
the
skin
off
her
nose
boating
and
got
a
raging
headache
by
reading
too
long
beth
was
worried
by
the
confusion
of
her
closet
and
the
difficulty
of
learning
three
or
four
songs
at
once
and
amy
deeply
regretted
the
damage
done
her
frock
for
katy
brown's
party
was
to
be
the
next
day
and
now
like
flora
mcflimsey
she
had
nothing
to
wear
but
these
were
mere
trifles
and
they
assured
their
mother
that
the
experiment
was
working
finely
she
smiled
said
nothing
and
with
hannah's
help
did
their
neglected
work
keeping
home
pleasant
and
the
domestic
machinery
running
smoothly
it
was
astonishing
what
a
peculiar
and
uncomfortable
state
of
things
was
produced
by
the
resting
and
revelling
process
the
days
kept
getting
longer
and
longer
the
weather
was
unusually
variable
and
so
were
tempers
an
unsettled
feeling
possessed
every
one
and
satan
found
plenty
of
mischief
for
the
idle
hands
to
do
as
the
height
of
luxury
meg
put
out
some
of
her
sewing
and
then
found
time
hang
so
heavily
that
she
fell
to
snipping
and
spoiling
her
clothes
in
her
attempts
to
furbish
them
up
à
la
moffat
jo
read
till
her
eyes
gave
out
and
she
was
sick
of
books
got
so
fidgety
that
even
good-natured
laurie
had
a
quarrel
with
her
and
so
reduced
in
spirits
that
she
desperately
wished
she
had
gone
with
aunt
march
beth
got
on
pretty
well
for
she
was
constantly
forgetting
that
it
was
to
be
_all
play
and
no
work_
and
fell
back
into
her
old
ways
now
and
then
but
something
in
the
air
affected
her
and
more
than
once
her
tranquillity
was
much
disturbed
so
much
so
that
on
one
occasion
she
actually
shook
poor
dear
joanna
and
told
her
she
was
a
fright
amy
fared
worst
of
all
for
her
resources
were
small
and
when
her
sisters
left
her
to
amuse
and
care
for
herself
she
soon
found
that
accomplished
and
important
little
self
a
great
burden
she
didn't
like
dolls
fairy-tales
were
childish
and
one
couldn't
draw
all
the
time
tea-parties
didn't
amount
to
much
neither
did
picnics
unless
very
well
conducted
if
one
could
have
a
fine
house
full
of
nice
girls
or
go
travelling
the
summer
would
be
delightful
but
to
stay
at
home
with
three
selfish
sisters
and
a
grown-up
boy
was
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
a
boaz
complained
miss
malaprop
after
several
days
devoted
to
pleasure
fretting
and
_ennui_
no
one
would
own
that
they
were
tired
of
the
experiment
but
by
friday
night
each
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
was
glad
the
week
was
nearly
done
hoping
to
impress
the
lesson
more
deeply
mrs
march
who
had
a
good
deal
of
humor
resolved
to
finish
off
the
trial
in
an
appropriate
manner
so
she
gave
hannah
a
holiday
and
let
the
girls
enjoy
the
full
effect
of
the
play
system
when
they
got
up
on
saturday
morning
there
was
no
fire
in
the
kitchen
no
breakfast
in
the
dining-room
and
no
mother
anywhere
to
be
seen
mercy
on
us
what
_has_
happened
cried
jo
staring
about
her
in
dismay
meg
ran
upstairs
and
soon
came
back
again
looking
relieved
but
rather
bewildered
and
a
little
ashamed
mother
isn't
sick
only
very
tired
and
she
says
she
is
going
to
stay
quietly
in
her
room
all
day
and
let
us
do
the
best
we
can
it's
a
very
queer
thing
for
her
to
do
she
doesn't
act
a
bit
like
herself
but
she
says
it
has
been
a
hard
week
for
her
so
we
mustn't
grumble
but
take
care
of
ourselves
that's
easy
enough
and
i
like
the
idea
i'm
aching
for
something
to
do--that
is
some
new
amusement
you
know
added
jo
quickly
in
fact
it
_was_
an
immense
relief
to
them
all
to
have
a
little
work
and
they
took
hold
with
a
will
but
soon
realized
the
truth
of
hannah's
saying
housekeeping
ain't
no
joke
there
was
plenty
of
food
in
the
larder
and
while
beth
and
amy
set
the
table
meg
and
jo
got
breakfast
wondering
as
they
did
so
why
servants
ever
talked
about
hard
work
i
shall
take
some
up
to
mother
though
she
said
we
were
not
to
think
of
her
for
she'd
take
care
of
herself
said
meg
who
presided
and
felt
quite
matronly
behind
the
teapot
so
a
tray
was
fitted
out
before
any
one
began
and
taken
up
with
the
cook's
compliments
the
boiled
tea
was
very
bitter
the
omelette
scorched
and
the
biscuits
speckled
with
saleratus
but
mrs
march
received
her
repast
with
thanks
and
laughed
heartily
over
it
after
jo
was
gone
poor
little
souls
they
will
have
a
hard
time
i'm
afraid
but
they
won't
suffer
and
it
will
do
them
good
she
said
producing
the
more
palatable
viands
with
which
she
had
provided
herself
and
disposing
of
the
bad
breakfast
so
that
their
feelings
might
not
be
hurt,--a
motherly
little
deception
for
which
they
were
grateful
many
were
the
complaints
below
and
great
the
chagrin
of
the
head
cook
at
her
failures
never
mind
i'll
get
the
dinner
and
be
servant
you
be
mistress
keep
your
hands
nice
see
company
and
give
orders
said
jo
who
knew
still
less
than
meg
about
culinary
affairs
this
obliging
offer
was
gladly
accepted
and
margaret
retired
to
the
parlor
which
she
hastily
put
in
order
by
whisking
the
litter
under
the
sofa
and
shutting
the
blinds
to
save
the
trouble
of
dusting
jo
with
perfect
faith
in
her
own
powers
and
a
friendly
desire
to
make
up
the
quarrel
immediately
put
a
note
in
the
office
inviting
laurie
to
dinner
you'd
better
see
what
you
have
got
before
you
think
of
having
company
said
meg
when
informed
of
the
hospitable
but
rash
act
oh
there's
corned
beef
and
plenty
of
potatoes
and
i
shall
get
some
asparagus
and
a
lobster
'for
a
relish,'
as
hannah
says
we'll
have
lettuce
and
make
a
salad
i
don't
know
how
but
the
book
tells
i'll
have
blanc-mange
and
strawberries
for
dessert
and
coffee
too
if
you
want
to
be
elegant
don't
try
too
many
messes
jo
for
you
can't
make
anything
but
gingerbread
and
molasses
candy
fit
to
eat
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
dinner-party
and
since
you
have
asked
laurie
on
your
own
responsibility
you
may
just
take
care
of
him
i
don't
want
you
to
do
anything
but
be
civil
to
him
and
help
to
the
pudding
you'll
give
me
your
advice
if
i
get
in
a
muddle
won't
you
asked
jo
rather
hurt
yes
but
i
don't
know
much
except
about
bread
and
a
few
trifles
you
had
better
ask
mother's
leave
before
you
order
anything
returned
meg
prudently
of
course
i
shall
i'm
not
a
fool
and
jo
went
off
in
a
huff
at
the
doubts
expressed
of
her
powers
get
what
you
like
and
don't
disturb
me
i'm
going
out
to
dinner
and
can't
worry
about
things
at
home
said
mrs
march
when
jo
spoke
to
her
i
never
enjoyed
housekeeping
and
i'm
going
to
take
a
vacation
to-day
and
read
write
go
visiting
and
amuse
myself
the
unusual
spectacle
of
her
busy
mother
rocking
comfortably
and
reading
early
in
the
morning
made
jo
feel
as
if
some
natural
phenomenon
had
occurred
for
an
eclipse
an
earthquake
or
a
volcanic
eruption
would
hardly
have
seemed
stranger
everything
is
out
of
sorts
somehow
she
said
to
herself
going
down
stairs
there's
beth
crying
that's
a
sure
sign
that
something
is
wrong
with
this
family
if
amy
is
bothering
i'll
shake
her
feeling
very
much
out
of
sorts
herself
jo
hurried
into
the
parlor
to
find
beth
sobbing
over
pip
the
canary
who
lay
dead
in
the
cage
with
his
little
claws
pathetically
extended
as
if
imploring
the
food
for
want
of
which
he
had
died
it's
all
my
fault--i
forgot
him--there
isn't
a
seed
or
a
drop
left
o
pip
o
pip
how
could
i
be
so
cruel
to
you
cried
beth
taking
the
poor
thing
in
her
hands
and
trying
to
restore
him
illustration
o
pip
o
pip
jo
peeped
into
his
half-open
eye
felt
his
little
heart
and
finding
him
stiff
and
cold
shook
her
head
and
offered
her
domino-box
for
a
coffin
put
him
in
the
oven
and
maybe
he
will
get
warm
and
revive
said
amy
hopefully
he's
been
starved
and
he
sha'n't
be
baked
now
he's
dead
i'll
make
him
a
shroud
and
he
shall
be
buried
in
the
garden
and
i'll
never
have
another
bird
never
my
pip
for
i
am
too
bad
to
own
one
murmured
beth
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
pet
folded
in
her
hands
the
funeral
shall
be
this
afternoon
and
we
will
all
go
now
don't
cry
bethy
it's
a
pity
but
nothing
goes
right
this
week
and
pip
has
had
the
worst
of
the
experiment
make
the
shroud
and
lay
him
in
my
box
and
after
the
dinner-party
we'll
have
a
nice
little
funeral
said
jo
beginning
to
feel
as
if
she
had
undertaken
a
good
deal
leaving
the
others
to
console
beth
she
departed
to
the
kitchen
which
was
in
a
most
discouraging
state
of
confusion
putting
on
a
big
apron
she
fell
to
work
and
got
the
dishes
piled
up
ready
for
washing
when
she
discovered
that
the
fire
was
out
here's
a
sweet
prospect
muttered
jo
slamming
the
stove-door
open
and
poking
vigorously
among
the
cinders
having
rekindled
the
fire
she
thought
she
would
go
to
market
while
the
water
heated
the
walk
revived
her
spirits
and
flattering
herself
that
she
had
made
good
bargains
she
trudged
home
again
after
buying
a
very
young
lobster
some
very
old
asparagus
and
two
boxes
of
acid
strawberries
by
the
time
she
got
cleared
up
the
dinner
arrived
and
the
stove
was
red-hot
hannah
had
left
a
pan
of
bread
to
rise
meg
had
worked
it
up
early
set
it
on
the
hearth
for
a
second
rising
and
forgotten
it
meg
was
entertaining
sallie
gardiner
in
the
parlor
when
the
door
flew
open
and
a
floury
crocky
flushed
and
dishevelled
figure
appeared
demanding
tartly,--
i
say
isn't
bread
'riz'
enough
when
it
runs
over
the
pans
sallie
began
to
laugh
but
meg
nodded
and
lifted
her
eyebrows
as
high
as
they
would
go
which
caused
the
apparition
to
vanish
and
put
the
sour
bread
into
the
oven
without
further
delay
mrs
march
went
out
after
peeping
here
and
there
to
see
how
matters
went
also
saying
a
word
of
comfort
to
beth
who
sat
making
a
winding-sheet
while
the
dear
departed
lay
in
state
in
the
domino-box
a
strange
sense
of
helplessness
fell
upon
the
girls
as
the
gray
bonnet
vanished
round
the
corner
and
despair
seized
them
when
a
few
minutes
later
miss
crocker
appeared
and
said
she'd
come
to
dinner
now
this
lady
was
a
thin
yellow
spinster
with
a
sharp
nose
and
inquisitive
eyes
who
saw
everything
and
gossiped
about
all
she
saw
they
disliked
her
but
had
been
taught
to
be
kind
to
her
simply
because
she
was
old
and
poor
and
had
few
friends
so
meg
gave
her
the
easy-chair
and
tried
to
entertain
her
while
she
asked
questions
criticised
everything
and
told
stories
of
the
people
whom
she
knew
language
cannot
describe
the
anxieties
experiences
and
exertions
which
jo
underwent
that
morning
and
the
dinner
she
served
up
became
a
standing
joke
fearing
to
ask
any
more
advice
she
did
her
best
alone
and
discovered
that
something
more
than
energy
and
good-will
is
necessary
to
make
a
cook
she
boiled
the
asparagus
for
an
hour
and
was
grieved
to
find
the
heads
cooked
off
and
the
stalks
harder
than
ever
the
bread
burnt
black
for
the
salad-dressing
so
aggravated
her
that
she
let
everything
else
go
till
she
had
convinced
herself
that
she
could
not
make
it
fit
to
eat
the
lobster
was
a
scarlet
mystery
to
her
but
she
hammered
and
poked
till
it
was
unshelled
and
its
meagre
proportions
concealed
in
a
grove
of
lettuce-leaves
the
potatoes
had
to
be
hurried
not
to
keep
the
asparagus
waiting
and
were
not
done
at
last
the
blanc-mange
was
lumpy
and
the
strawberries
not
as
ripe
as
they
looked
having
been
skilfully
deaconed
well
they
can
eat
beef
and
bread
and
butter
if
they
are
hungry
only
it's
mortifying
to
have
to
spend
your
whole
morning
for
nothing
thought
jo
as
she
rang
the
bell
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
and
stood
hot
tired
and
dispirited
surveying
the
feast
spread
for
laurie
accustomed
to
all
sorts
of
elegance
and
miss
crocker
whose
curious
eyes
would
mark
all
failures
and
whose
tattling
tongue
would
report
them
far
and
wide
poor
jo
would
gladly
have
gone
under
the
table
as
one
thing
after
another
was
tasted
and
left
while
amy
giggled
meg
looked
distressed
miss
crocker
pursed
up
her
lips
and
laurie
talked
and
laughed
with
all
his
might
to
give
a
cheerful
tone
to
the
festive
scene
jo's
one
strong
point
was
the
fruit
for
she
had
sugared
it
well
and
had
a
pitcher
of
rich
cream
to
eat
with
it
her
hot
cheeks
cooled
a
trifle
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
as
the
pretty
glass
plates
went
round
and
every
one
looked
graciously
at
the
little
rosy
islands
floating
in
a
sea
of
cream
miss
crocker
tasted
first
made
a
wry
face
and
drank
some
water
hastily
jo
who
had
refused
thinking
there
might
not
be
enough
for
they
dwindled
sadly
after
the
picking
over
glanced
at
laurie
but
he
was
eating
away
manfully
though
there
was
a
slight
pucker
about
his
mouth
and
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
his
plate
amy
who
was
fond
of
delicate
fare
took
a
heaping
spoonful
choked
hid
her
face
in
her
napkin
and
left
the
table
precipitately
illustration
miss
crocker
made
a
wry
face
oh
what
is
it
exclaimed
jo
trembling
salt
instead
of
sugar
and
the
cream
is
sour
replied
meg
with
a
tragic
gesture
jo
uttered
a
groan
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
remembering
that
she
had
given
a
last
hasty
powdering
to
the
berries
out
of
one
of
the
two
boxes
on
the
kitchen
table
and
had
neglected
to
put
the
milk
in
the
refrigerator
she
turned
scarlet
and
was
on
the
verge
of
crying
when
she
met
laurie's
eyes
which
_would_
look
merry
in
spite
of
his
heroic
efforts
the
comical
side
of
the
affair
suddenly
struck
her
and
she
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
so
did
every
one
else
even
croaker
as
the
girls
called
the
old
lady
and
the
unfortunate
dinner
ended
gayly
with
bread
and
butter
olives
and
fun
i
haven't
strength
of
mind
enough
to
clear
up
now
so
we
will
sober
ourselves
with
a
funeral
said
jo
as
they
rose
and
miss
crocker
made
ready
to
go
being
eager
to
tell
the
new
story
at
another
friend's
dinner-table
they
did
sober
themselves
for
beth's
sake
laurie
dug
a
grave
under
the
ferns
in
the
grove
little
pip
was
laid
in
with
many
tears
by
his
tender-hearted
mistress
and
covered
with
moss
while
a
wreath
of
violets
and
chickweed
was
hung
on
the
stone
which
bore
his
epitaph
composed
by
jo
while
she
struggled
with
the
dinner:--
here
lies
pip
march
who
died
the
7th
of
june
loved
and
lamented
sore
and
not
forgotten
soon
at
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremonies
beth
retired
to
her
room
overcome
with
emotion
and
lobster
but
there
was
no
place
of
repose
for
the
beds
were
not
made
and
she
found
her
grief
much
assuaged
by
beating
up
pillows
and
putting
things
in
order
meg
helped
jo
clear
away
the
remains
of
the
feast
which
took
half
the
afternoon
and
left
them
so
tired
that
they
agreed
to
be
contented
with
tea
and
toast
for
supper
laurie
took
amy
to
drive
which
was
a
deed
of
charity
for
the
sour
cream
seemed
to
have
had
a
bad
effect
upon
her
temper
mrs
march
came
home
to
find
the
three
older
girls
hard
at
work
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
a
glance
at
the
closet
gave
her
an
idea
of
the
success
of
one
part
of
the
experiment
before
the
housewives
could
rest
several
people
called
and
there
was
a
scramble
to
get
ready
to
see
them
then
tea
must
be
got
errands
done
and
one
or
two
necessary
bits
of
sewing
neglected
till
the
last
minute
as
twilight
fell
dewy
and
still
one
by
one
they
gathered
in
the
porch
where
the
june
roses
were
budding
beautifully
and
each
groaned
or
sighed
as
she
sat
down
as
if
tired
or
troubled
what
a
dreadful
day
this
has
been
begun
jo
usually
the
first
to
speak
it
has
seemed
shorter
than
usual
but
_so_
uncomfortable
said
meg
not
a
bit
like
home
added
amy
it
can't
seem
so
without
marmee
and
little
pip
sighed
beth
glancing
with
full
eyes
at
the
empty
cage
above
her
head
here's
mother
dear
and
you
shall
have
another
bird
to-morrow
if
you
want
it
as
she
spoke
mrs
march
came
and
took
her
place
among
them
looking
as
if
her
holiday
had
not
been
much
pleasanter
than
theirs
are
you
satisfied
with
your
experiment
girls
or
do
you
want
another
week
of
it
she
asked
as
beth
nestled
up
to
her
and
the
rest
turned
toward
her
with
brightening
faces
as
flowers
turn
toward
the
sun
i
don't
cried
jo
decidedly
nor
i
echoed
the
others
you
think
then
that
it
is
better
to
have
a
few
duties
and
live
a
little
for
others
do
you
lounging
and
larking
doesn't
pay
observed
jo
shaking
her
head
i'm
tired
of
it
and
mean
to
go
to
work
at
something
right
off
suppose
you
learn
plain
cooking
that's
a
useful
accomplishment
which
no
woman
should
be
without
said
mrs
march
laughing
inaudibly
at
the
recollection
of
jo's
dinner-party
for
she
had
met
miss
crocker
and
heard
her
account
of
it
mother
did
you
go
away
and
let
everything
be
just
to
see
how
we'd
get
on
cried
meg
who
had
had
suspicions
all
day
yes
i
wanted
you
to
see
how
the
comfort
of
all
depends
on
each
doing
her
share
faithfully
while
hannah
and
i
did
your
work
you
got
on
pretty
well
though
i
don't
think
you
were
very
happy
or
amiable
so
i
thought
as
a
little
lesson
i
would
show
you
what
happens
when
every
one
thinks
only
of
herself
don't
you
feel
that
it
is
pleasanter
to
help
one
another
to
have
daily
duties
which
make
leisure
sweet
when
it
comes
and
to
bear
and
forbear
that
home
may
be
comfortable
and
lovely
to
us
all
we
do
mother
we
do
cried
the
girls
then
let
me
advise
you
to
take
up
your
little
burdens
again
for
though
they
seem
heavy
sometimes
they
are
good
for
us
and
lighten
as
we
learn
to
carry
them
work
is
wholesome
and
there
is
plenty
for
every
one
it
keeps
us
from
_ennui_
and
mischief
is
good
for
health
and
spirits
and
gives
us
a
sense
of
power
and
independence
better
than
money
or
fashion
we'll
work
like
bees
and
love
it
too
see
if
we
don't
said
jo
i'll
learn
plain
cooking
for
my
holiday
task
and
the
next
dinner-party
i
have
shall
be
a
success
i'll
make
the
set
of
shirts
for
father
instead
of
letting
you
do
it
marmee
i
can
and
i
will
though
i'm
not
fond
of
sewing
that
will
be
better
than
fussing
over
my
own
things
which
are
plenty
nice
enough
as
they
are
said
meg
i'll
do
my
lessons
every
day
and
not
spend
so
much
time
with
my
music
and
dolls
i
am
a
stupid
thing
and
ought
to
be
studying
not
playing
was
beth's
resolution
while
amy
followed
their
example
by
heroically
declaring
i
shall
learn
to
make
button-holes
and
attend
to
my
parts
of
speech
very
good
then
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
the
experiment
and
fancy
that
we
shall
not
have
to
repeat
it
only
don't
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
delve
like
slaves
have
regular
hours
for
work
and
play
make
each
day
both
useful
and
pleasant
and
prove
that
you
understand
the
worth
of
time
by
employing
it
well
then
youth
will
be
delightful
old
age
will
bring
few
regrets
and
life
become
a
beautiful
success
in
spite
of
poverty
we'll
remember
mother
and
they
did
illustration
we'll
work
like
bees

beth
was
post-mistress
for
being
most
at
home
she
could
attend
to
it
regularly
and
dearly
liked
the
daily
task
of
unlocking
the
little
door
and
distributing
the
mail
one
july
day
she
came
in
with
her
hands
full
and
went
about
the
house
leaving
letters
and
parcels
like
the
penny
post
here's
your
posy
mother
laurie
never
forgets
that
she
said
putting
the
fresh

that
stood
in

corner
and
was
kept
supplied
by
the
affectionate

a
glove

delivering
the
articles
to

who
sat
near
her

stitching
wristbands
why
i
left
a
pair
over
there
and
here
is
only
one

looking
at
the
gray
cotton
glove
didn't
you
drop
the
other
in
the
garden
no
i'm
sure
i
didn't
for
there
was
only
one
in
the
office
i
hate
to
have
odd
gloves
never
mind
the
other

be
found
my

of

mrs
march
glanced
at
meg
who
was
looking
very
pretty
in
her
gingham
morning-gown
with
the
little
curls
blowing
about
her
forehead
and
very
womanly
as
she
sat
sewing
at
her
little
work-table
full
of
tidy
white
rolls
so
unconscious
of
the
thought
in
her
mother's
mind
as
she
sewed
and
sung
while
her
fingers
flew
and
her
thoughts
were
busied
with
girlish
fancies
as
innocent
and
fresh
as
the
pansies
in
her
belt
that
mrs
march
smiled
and
was
satisfied
two
letters
for
doctor
jo
a
book
and
a
funny
old
hat
which
covered
the
whole
post-office
stuck
outside
said
beth
laughing
as
she
went
into
the
study
where
jo
sat
writing
what
a
sly
fellow
laurie
is
i
said
i
wished
bigger
hats
were
the
fashion
because
i
burn
my
face
every
hot
day
he
said
'why
mind
the
fashion
wear
a
big
hat
and
be
comfortable!'
i
said
i
would
if
i
had
one
and
he
has
sent
me
this
to
try
me
i'll
wear
it
for
fun
and
show
him
i
_don't_
care
for
the
fashion
and
hanging
the
antique
broad-brim
on
a
bust
of
plato
jo
read
her
letters
one
from
her
mother
made
her
cheeks
glow
and
her
eyes
fill
for
it
said
to
her,--
my
dear
i
write
a
little
word
to
tell
you
with
how
much
satisfaction
i
watch
your
efforts
to
control
your
temper
you
say
nothing
about
your
trials
failures
or
successes
and
think
perhaps
that
no
one
sees
them
but
the
friend
whose
help
you
daily
ask
if
i
may
trust
the
well-worn
cover
of
your
guide-book
_i_
too
have
seen
them
all
and
heartily
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
your
resolution
since
it
begins
to
bear
fruit
go
on
dear
patiently
and
bravely
and
always
believe
that
no
one
sympathizes
more
tenderly
with
you
than
your
loving
mother
that
does
me
good
that's
worth
millions
of
money
and
pecks
of
praise
o
marmee
i
do
try
i
will
keep
on
trying
and
not
get
tired
since
i
have
you
to
help
me
laying
her
head
on
her
arms
jo
wet
her
little
romance
with
a
few
happy
tears
for
she
_had_
thought
that
no
one
saw
and
appreciated
her
efforts
to
be
good
and
this
assurance
was
doubly
precious
doubly
encouraging
because
unexpected
and
from
the
person
whose
commendation
she
most
valued
feeling
stronger
than
ever
to
meet
and
subdue
her
apollyon
she
pinned
the
note
inside
her
frock
as
a
shield
and
a
reminder
lest
she
be
taken
unaware
and
proceeded
to
open
her
other
letter
quite
ready
for
either
good
or
bad
news
in
a
big
dashing
hand
laurie
wrote,--
dear
jo
what
ho
some
english
girls
and
boys
are
coming
to
see
me
to-morrow
and
i
want
to
have
a
jolly
time
if
it's
fine
i'm
going
to
pitch
my
tent
in
longmeadow
and
row
up
the
whole
crew
to
lunch
and
croquet,--have
a
fire
make
messes
gypsy
fashion
and
all
sorts
of
larks
they
are
nice
people
and
like
such
things
brooke
will
go
to
keep
us
boys
steady
and
kate
vaughn
will
play
propriety
for
the
girls
i
want
you
all
to
come
can't
let
beth
off
at
any
price
and
nobody
shall
worry
her
don't
bother
about
rations,--i'll
see

that
and
everything
else,--only
do
come
there's
a
good
fellow
in
a
tearing
hurry

jo

in
to
tell

of
course

such
a
help
to
laurie
for
i

meg
see

useful
in
some
way
i
hope
the
vaughns

not
fine
grown-up
people
do
you
know
anything
about
them
jo
asked
meg
only
that
there
are
four
of
them
kate
is
older
than
you
fred
and
frank
twins
about
my
age
and
a
little
girl
grace
who
is
nine
or
ten
laurie
knew
them
abroad
and
liked
the
boys
i
fancied
from
the
way
he
primmed
up
his
mouth
in
speaking
of
her
that
he
didn't
admire
kate
much
i'm
so
glad
my
french
print
is
clean
it's
just
the
thing
and
so
becoming
observed
meg
complacently
have
you
anything
decent
jo
scarlet
and
gray
boating
suit
good
enough
for
me
i
shall
row
and
tramp
about
so
i
don't
want
any
starch
to
think
of
you'll
come
bethy
if
you
won't
let
any
of
the
boys
talk
to
me
not
a
boy
i
like
to
please
laurie
and
i'm
not
afraid
of
mr
brooke
he
is
so
kind
but
i
don't
want
to
play
or
sing
or
say
anything
i'll
work
hard
and
not
trouble
any
one
and
you'll
take
care
of
me
jo
so
i'll
go
that's
my
good
girl
you
do
try
to
fight
off
your
shyness
and
i
love
you
for
it
fighting
faults
isn't
easy
as
i
know
and
a
cheery
word
kind
of
gives
a
lift
thank
you
mother
and
jo
gave
the
thin
cheek
a
grateful
kiss
more
precious
to
mrs
march
than
if
it
had
given
back
the
rosy
roundness
of
her
youth
i
had
a
box
of
chocolate
drops
and
the
picture
i
wanted
to
copy
said
amy
showing
her
mail
and
i
got
a
note
from
mr
laurence
asking
me
to
come
over
and
play
to
him
to-night
before
the
lamps
are
lighted
and
i
shall
go
added
beth
whose
friendship
with
the
old
gentleman
prospered
finely
now
let's
fly
round
and
do
double
duty
to-day
so
that
we
can
play
to-morrow
with
free
minds
said
jo
preparing
to
replace
her
pen
with
a
broom
when
the
sun
peeped
into
the
girls'
room
early
next
morning
to
promise
them
a
fine
day
he
saw
a
comical
sight
each
had
made
such
preparation
for
the
fête
as
seemed
necessary
and
proper
meg
had
an
extra
row
of
little
curl-papers
across
her
forehead
jo
had
copiously
anointed
her
afflicted
face
with
cold
cream
beth
had
taken
joanna
to
bed
with
her
to
atone
for
the
approaching
separation
and
amy
had
capped
the
climax
by
putting
a
clothes-pin
on
her
nose
to
uplift
the
offending
feature
it
was
one
of
the
kind
artists
use
to
hold
the
paper
on
their
drawing-boards
therefore
quite
appropriate
and
effective
for
the
purpose
to
which
it
was
now
put
this
funny
spectacle
appeared
to
amuse
the
sun
for
he
burst
out
with
such
radiance
that
jo
woke
up
and
roused
all
her
sisters
by
a
hearty
laugh
at
amy's
ornament
illustration
amy
capped
the
climax
by
putting
a
clothes-pin
on
her
nose
sunshine
and
laughter
were
good
omens
for
a
pleasure
party
and
soon
a
lively
bustle
began
in
both
houses
beth
who
was
ready
first
kept
reporting
what
went
on
next
door
and
enlivened
her
sisters'
toilets
by
frequent
telegrams
from
the
window
there
goes
the
man
with
the
tent
i
see
mrs
barker
doing
up
the
lunch
in
a
hamper
and
a
great
basket
now
mr
laurence
is
looking
up
at
the
sky
and
the
weathercock
i
wish
he
would
go
too
there's
laurie
looking
like
a
sailor,--nice
boy
oh
mercy
me
here's
a
carriage
full
of
people--a
tall
lady
a
little
girl
and
two
dreadful
boys
one
is
lame
poor
thing
he's
got
a
crutch
laurie
didn't
tell
us
that
be
quick
girls
it's
getting
late
why
there
is
ned
moffat
i
do
declare
look
meg
isn't
that
the
man
who
bowed
to
you
one
day
when
we
were
shopping
so
it
is
how
queer
that
he
should
come
i
thought
he
was
at
the
mountains
there
is
sallie
i'm
glad
she
got
back
in
time
am
i
all
right
jo
cried
meg
in
a
flutter
a
regular
daisy
hold
up
your
dress
and
put
your
hat
straight
it
looks
sentimental
tipped
that
way
and
will
fly
off
at
the
first
puff
now
then
come
on
o
jo
you
are
not
going
to
wear
that
awful
hat
it's
too
absurd
you
shall
_not_
make
a
guy
of
yourself
remonstrated
meg
as
jo
tied
down
with
a
red
ribbon
the
broad-brimmed
old-fashioned
leghorn
laurie
had
sent
for
a
joke
i
just
will
though
for
it's
capital,--so
shady
light
and
big
it
will
make
fun
and
i
don't
mind
being
a
guy
if
i'm
comfortable
with
that
jo
marched
straight
away
and
the
rest
followed,--a
bright
little
band
of
sisters
all
looking
their
best
in
summer
suits
with
happy
faces
under
the
jaunty
hat-brims
laurie
ran
to
meet
and
present
them
to
his
friends
in
the
most
cordial
manner
the
lawn
was
the
reception-room
and
for
several
minutes
a
lively
scene
was
enacted
there
meg
was
grateful
to
see
that
miss
kate
though
twenty
was
dressed
with
a
simplicity
which
american
girls
would
do
well
to
imitate
and
she
was
much
flattered
by
mr
ned's
assurances
that
he
came
especially
to
see
her
jo
understood
why
laurie
primmed
up
his
mouth
when
speaking
of
kate
for
that
young
lady
had
a
stand-off-don't-touch-me
air
which
contrasted
strongly
with
the
free
and
easy
demeanor
of
the
other
girls
beth
took
an
observation
of
the
new
boys
and
decided
that
the
lame
one
was
not
dreadful
but
gentle
and
feeble
and
she
would
be
kind
to
him
on
that
account
amy
found
grace
a
well-mannered
merry
little
person
and
after
staring
dumbly
at
one
another
for
a
few
minutes
they
suddenly
became
very
good
friends
tents
lunch
and
croquet
utensils
having
been
sent
on
beforehand
the
party
was
soon
embarked
and
the
two
boats
pushed
off
together
leaving
mr
laurence
waving
his
hat
on
the
shore
laurie
and
jo
rowed
one
boat
mr
brooke
and
ned
the
other
while
fred
vaughn
the
riotous
twin
did
his
best
to
upset
both
by
paddling
about
in
a
wherry
like
a
disturbed
water-bug
jo's
funny
hat
deserved
a
vote
of
thanks
for
it
was
of
general
utility
it
broke
the
ice
in
the
beginning
by
producing
a
laugh
it
created
quite
a
refreshing
breeze
flapping
to
and
fro
as
she
rowed
and
would
make
an
excellent
umbrella
for
the
whole
party
if
a
shower
came
up
she
said
kate
looked
rather
amazed
at
jo's
proceedings
especially
as
she
exclaimed
christopher
columbus
when
she
lost
her
oar
and
laurie
said
my
dear
fellow
did
i
hurt
you
when
he
tripped
over
her
feet
in
taking
his
place
but
after
putting
up
her
glass
to
examine
the
queer
girl
several
times
miss
kate
decided
that
she
was
odd
but
rather
clever
and
smiled
upon
her
from
afar
illustration
mr
laurence
waving
his
hat
meg
in
the
other
boat
was
delightfully
situated
face
to
face
with
the
rowers
who
both
admired
the
prospect
and
feathered
their
oars
with
uncommon
skill
and
dexterity
mr
brooke
was
a

never

he
looked
at

a
good
deal

that

not

it
their

mr

chose
meg
kate
and
fred
laurie
took
sallie
jo
and
ned
the
englishers
played
well
but
the
americans
played
better
and
contested
every
inch
of
the
ground
as
strongly
as
if
the
spirit
of
'76
inspired
them
jo
and
fred
had
several
skirmishes
and
once
narrowly
escaped
high
words
jo
was
through
the
last
wicket
and
had
missed
the
stroke
which
failure
ruffled
her
a
good
deal
fred
was
close
behind
her
and
his
turn
came
before
hers
he
gave
a
stroke
his
ball
hit
the
wicket
and
stopped
an
inch
on
the
wrong
side
no
one
was
very
near
and
running
up
to
examine
he
gave
it
a
sly
nudge
with
his
toe
which
put
it
just
an
inch
on
the
right
side
i'm
through
now
miss
jo
i'll
settle
you
and
get
in
first

the
young

his

you
pushed
it
i
saw
you
it's
my
turn

jo
sharply
upon
my
word
i
didn't
move
it
it
rolled
a
bit
perhaps
but
that
is
allowed
so
stand
off
please
and
let
me
have
a
go
at
the
stake
we
don't
cheat
in
america
but
you
can
if
you
choose
said
jo
angrily
yankees
are
a
deal
the
most
tricky
everybody
knows
there
you
go
returned
fred
croqueting
her
ball
far
away
jo
opened
her
lips
to
say
something
rude
but
checked
herself
in
time
colored
up
to
her
forehead
and
stood
a
minute
hammering
down
a
wicket
with
all
her
might
while
fred
hit
the
stake
and
declared
himself
out
with
much
exultation
she
went
off
to
get
her
ball
and
was
a
long
time
finding
it
among
the
bushes
but
she
came
back
looking
cool
and
quiet
and
waited
her
turn
patiently
it
took
several
strokes
to
regain
the
place
she
had
lost
and
when
she
got
there
the
other
side
had
nearly
won
for
kate's
ball
was
the
last
but
one
and
lay
near
the
stake
by
george
it's
all
up
with
us
good-by
kate
miss
jo
owes
me
one
so
you
are
finished
cried
fred
excitedly
as
they
all
drew
near
to
see
the
finish
yankees
have
a
trick
of
being
generous
to
their
enemies
said
jo
with
a
look
that
made
the
lad
redden
especially
when
they
beat
them
she
added
as
leaving
kate's
ball
untouched
she
won
the
game
by
a
clever
stroke
laurie
threw
up
his
hat
then
remembered
that
it
wouldn't
do
to
exult
over
the
defeat
of
his
guests
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
cheer
to
whisper
to
his
friend,--
good
for
you
jo
he
did
cheat
i
saw
him
we
can't
tell
him
so
but
he
won't
do
it
again
take
my
word
for
it
meg
drew
her
aside
under
pretence
of
pinning
up
a
loose
braid
and
said
approvingly,--
it
was
dreadfully
provoking
but
you
kept
your
temper
and
i'm
so
glad
jo
don't
praise
me
meg
for
i
could
box
his
ears
this
minute
i
should
certainly
have
boiled
over
if
i
hadn't
stayed
among
the
nettles
till
i
got
my
rage
under
enough
to
hold
my
tongue
it's
simmering
now
so
i
hope
he'll
keep
out
of
my
way

her

glowered

you

i
thought

suit
brooke
but
he
keeps
talking

kate
just
stares
at
them
through
that
ridiculous
glass
of
hers
i'm
going
so
you
needn't
try
to
preach
propriety
for
you
can't

jo
miss

did
know
several
new
games
and
as
the

not
and
the

could
not
eat

they
all
adjourned
to
the
drawing-room
to
play
rigmarole
one

a
story
any
nonsense
you
like
and
tells
as
long
as

taking
care
to
stop
short
at
some
exciting
point
when
the
next
takes
it
up
and
does
the
same
it's
very
funny
when
well
done
and
makes
a
perfect
jumble
of
tragical
comical
stuff
to
laugh
over
please
start
it
mr
brooke
said
kate
with
a
commanding
air
which
surprised
meg
who
treated
the
tutor
with
as
much
respect
as
any
other
gentleman
lying
on
the
grass
at
the
feet
of
the
two
young
ladies
mr
brooke
obediently
began
the
story
with
the
handsome
brown
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
the
sunshiny
river
once
on
a
time
a
knight
went
out
into
the
world
to
seek
his
fortune
for
he
had
nothing
but
his
sword
and
his
shield
he
travelled
a
long
while
nearly
eight-and-twenty
years
and
had
a
hard
time
of
it
till
he
came
to
the
palace
of
a
good
old
king
who
had
offered
a
reward
to
any
one
who
would
tame
and
train
a
fine
but
unbroken
colt
of
which
he
was
very
fond
the
knight
agreed
to
try
and
got
on
slowly
but
surely
for
the
colt
was
a
gallant
fellow
and
soon
learned
to
love
his
new
master
though
he
was
freakish
and
wild
every
day
when
he
gave
his
lessons
to
this
pet
of
the
king's
the
knight
rode
him
through
the
city
and
as
he
rode
he
looked
everywhere
for
a
certain
beautiful
face
which
he
had
seen
many
times
in
his
dreams
but
never
found
one
day
as
he
went
prancing
down
a
quiet
street
he
saw
at
the
window
of
a
ruinous
castle
the
lovely
face
he
was
delighted
inquired
who
lived
in
this
old
castle
and
was
told
that
several
captive
princesses
were
kept
there
by
a
spell
and
spun
all
day
to
lay
up
money
to
buy
their
liberty
the
knight
wished
intensely
that
he
could
free
them
but
he
was
poor
and
could
only
go
by
each
day
watching
for
the
sweet
face
and
longing
to
see
it
out
in
the
sunshine
at
last
he
resolved
to
get
into
the
castle
and
ask
how
he
could
help
them
he
went
and
knocked
the
great
door
flew
open
and
he
beheld--
illustration
he
went
prancing
down
a
quiet
street
a
ravishingly
lovely
lady
who
exclaimed
with
a
cry
of
rapture
'at
last
at
last!'
continued
kate
who
had
read
french
novels
and
admired
the
style
''tis
she!'
cried
count
gustave
and
fell
at
her
feet
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
'oh
rise!'
she
said
extending
a
hand
of
marble
fairness
'never
till
you
tell
me
how
i
may
rescue
you,'
swore
the
knight
still
kneeling
'alas
my
cruel
fate
condemns
me
to
remain
here
till
my
tyrant
is
destroyed.'
'where
is
the
villain?'
'in
the
mauve
salon
go
brave
heart
and
save
me
from
despair.'
'i
obey
and
return
victorious
or
dead!'
with
these
thrilling
words
he
rushed
away
and
flinging
open
the
door
of
the
mauve
salon
was
about
to
enter
when
he
received--
illustration
oh
rise
she
said
a
stunning
blow
from
the
big
greek
lexicon
which
an
old
fellow
in
a
black
gown
fired
at
him
said
ned
instantly
sir
what's-his-name
recovered
himself
pitched
the
tyrant
out
of
the
window
and
turned
to
join
the
lady
victorious
but
with
a
bump
on
his
brow
found
the
door
locked
tore
up
the
curtains
made
a
rope
ladder
got
half-way
down
when
the
ladder
broke
and
he
went
head
first
into
the
moat
sixty
feet
below
could
swim
like
a
duck
paddled
round
the
castle
till
he
came
to
a
little
door
guarded
by
two
stout
fellows
knocked
their
heads
together
till
they
cracked
like
a
couple
of
nuts
then
by
a
trifling
exertion
of
his
prodigious
strength
he
smashed
in
the
door
went
up
a
pair
of
stone
steps
covered
with
dust
a
foot
thick
toads
as
big
as
your
fist
and
spiders
that
would
frighten
you
into
hysterics
miss
march
at
the
top
of
these
steps
he
came
plump
upon
a
sight
that
took
his
breath
away
and
chilled
his
blood--
illustration
a
stunning
blow
from
the
big
greek
lexicon
a
tall
figure
all
in
white
with
a
veil
over
its
face
and
a
lamp
in
its
wasted
hand
went
on
meg
it
beckoned
gliding
noiselessly
before
him
down
a
corridor
as
dark
and
cold
as
any
tomb
shadowy
effigies
in
armor
stood
on
either
side
a
dead
silence
reigned
the
lamp
burned
blue
and
the
ghostly
figure
ever
and
anon
turned
its
face
toward
him
showing
the
glitter
of
awful
eyes
through
its
white
veil
they
reached
a
curtained
door
behind
which
sounded
lovely
music
he
sprang
forward
to
enter
but
the
spectre
plucked
him
back
and
waved
threateningly
before
him
a--
snuff-box
said
jo
in
a
sepulchral
tone
which
convulsed
the
audience
'thankee,'
said
the
knight
politely
as
he
took
a
pinch
and
sneezed
seven
times
so
violently
that
his
head
fell
off
'ha
ha!'
laughed
the
ghost
and
having
peeped
through
the
key-hole
at
the
princesses
spinning
away
for
dear
life
the
evil
spirit
picked
up
her
victim
and
put
him
in
a
large
tin
box
where
there
were
eleven
other
knights
packed
together
without
their
heads
like
sardines
who
all
rose
and
began
to--

jo
paused
for

they
danced

in

'up

roared
the

sallie
as

ended
his
rigmarole
in

he
had
jumbled
together
pell-mell
nautical
phrases
and
facts
out
of
one
of
his
favorite
books
well
they
went
to
the
bottom
and
a
nice
mermaid
welcomed
them
but
was
much
grieved
on
finding
the
box
of
headless
knights
and
kindly
pickled
them
in
brine
hoping
to
discover
the
mystery
about
them
for
being
a
woman
she
was
curious
by
and
by
a
diver
came
down
and
the
mermaid
said
'i'll
give
you
this
box
of
pearls
if
you
can
take
it
up;'
for
she
wanted
to
restore
the
poor
things
to
life
and
couldn't
raise
the
heavy
load
herself
so
the
diver
hoisted
it
up
and
was
much
disappointed
on
opening
it
to
find
no
pearls
he
left
it
in
a
great
lonely
field
where
it
was
found
by
a--
little
goose-girl
who
kept
a
hundred
fat
geese
in
the
field
said
amy
when
sallie's
invention
gave
out
the
little
girl
was
sorry
for
them
and
asked
an
old
woman
what
she
should
do
to
help
them
'your
geese
will
tell
you
they
know
everything,'
said
the
old
woman
so
she
asked
what
she
should
use
for
new
heads
since
the
old
ones
were
lost
and
all
the
geese
opened
their
hundred
mouths
and
screamed--
'cabbages!'
continued
laurie
promptly
'just
the
thing,'
said
the
girl
and
ran
to
get
twelve

ones
from
her
garden
she
put
them
on
the
knights
revived
at
once
thanked
her
and
went
on
their
way
rejoicing
never
knowing
the
difference
for
there
were
so
many
other
heads
like
them
in
the
world
that
no
one
thought
anything
of
it
the
knight
in
whom
i'm
interested
went
back
to
find
the
pretty
face
and
learned
that
the
princesses
had
spun
themselves
free
and
all
gone
to
be
married
but
one
he
was
in
a
great
state
of
mind
at
that
and
mounting
the
colt
who
stood
by
him
through
thick
and
thin
rushed
to
the
castle
to
see
which
was
left
peeping
over
the
hedge
he
saw
the
queen
of
his
affections
picking
flowers
in
her
garden
'will
you
give
me
a
rose?'
said
he
'you
must
come
and
get
it
i
can't
come
to
you
it
isn't
proper,'
said
she
as
sweet
as
honey
he
tried
to
climb
over
the
hedge
but
it
seemed
to
grow
higher
and
higher
then
he
tried
to
push
through
but
it
grew
thicker
and
thicker
and
he
was
in
despair
so
he
patiently
broke
twig
after
twig
till
he
had
made
a
little
hole
through
which
he
peeped
saying
imploringly
'let
me
in
let
me
in!'
but
the
pretty
princess
did
not
seem
to
understand
for
she
picked
her
roses
quietly
and
left
him
to
fight
his
way
in
whether
he
did
or
not
frank
will
tell
you
illustration
will
you
give
me
a
rose
i
can't
i'm
not
playing
i
never
do
said
frank
dismayed
at
the
sentimental
predicament
out
of
which
he
was
to
rescue
the
absurd
couple
beth
had
disappeared
behind
jo
and
grace
was
asleep
so
the
poor
knight
is
to
be
left
sticking
in
the
hedge
is
he
asked
mr
brooke
still
watching
the
river
and
playing
with
the
wild
rose
in
his
button-hole
i
guess
the
princess
gave
him
a
posy
and
opened
the
gate
after
a
while
said
laurie
smiling
to
himself
as
he
threw
acorns
at
his
tutor
what
a
piece
of
nonsense
we
have
made
with
practice
we
might
do
something
quite
clever
do
you
know
'truth'
asked
sallie
after
they
had
laughed
over
their
story
i
hope
so
said
meg
soberly
the
game
i
mean
what
is
it
said
fred
why
you
pile
up
your
hands
choose
a
number
and
draw
out
in
turn
and
the
person
who
draws
at
the
number
has
to
answer
truly
any
questions
put
by
the
rest
it's
great
fun
let's
try
it
said
jo
who
liked
new
experiments
miss
kate
and
mr
brooke
meg
and
ned
declined
but
fred
sallie
jo
and
laurie
piled
and
drew
and
the
lot
fell
to
laurie
who
are
your
heroes
asked
jo
grandfather
and
napoleon
which
lady
here
do
you
think
prettiest
said
sallie
margaret
which
do
you
like
best
from
fred
jo
of
course
what
silly
questions
you
ask
and
jo
gave
a
disdainful
shrug
as
the
rest
laughed
at
laurie's
matter-of-fact
tone
try
again
truth
isn't
a
bad
game
said
fred
it's
a
very
good
one
for
you
retorted
jo
in
a
low
voice
her
turn
came
next
what
is
your
greatest
fault
asked
fred
by
way
of
testing
in
her
the
virtue
he
lacked
himself
a
quick
temper
what
do
you
most
wish
for
said
laurie
a
pair
of
boot-lacings
returned
jo
guessing
and
defeating
his
purpose
not
a
true
answer
you
must
say
what
you
really
do
want
most
genius
don't
you
wish
you
could
give
it
to
me
laurie
and
she
slyly
smiled
in
his
disappointed
face
what
virtues
do
you
most
admire
in
a
man
asked
sallie
courage
and
honesty
now
my
turn
said
fred
as
his
hand
came
last
let's
give
it
to
him
whispered
laurie
to
jo
who
nodded
and
asked
at
once,--
didn't
you
cheat
at
croquet
well
yes
a
little
bit
good
didn't
you
take
your
story
out
of
'the
sea-lion?'
said
laurie
rather
don't
you
think
the
english
nation
perfect
in
every
respect
asked
sallie
i
should
be
ashamed
of
myself
if
i
didn't
he's
a
true
john
bull
now
miss
sallie
you
shall
have
a
chance
without
waiting
to
draw
i'll
harrow
up
your
feelings
first
by
asking
if
you
don't
think
you
are
something
of
a
flirt
said
laurie
as
jo
nodded
to
fred
as
a
sign
that
peace
was
declared
you
impertinent
boy
of
course
i'm
not
exclaimed
sallie
with
an
air
that
proved
the
contrary
what
do
you
hate
most
asked
fred
spiders
and
rice-pudding
what
do
you
like
best
asked
jo
dancing
and
french
gloves
well
_i_
think
truth
is
a
very
silly
play
let's
have
a
sensible
game
of
authors
to
refresh
our
minds
proposed
jo
ned
frank
and
the
little
girls
joined
in
this
and
while
it
went
on
the
three
elders
sat
apart
talking
miss
kate
took
out
her
sketch
again
and
margaret
watched
her
while
mr
brooke
lay
on
the
grass
with
a
book
which
he
did
not
read
how
beautifully
you
do
it
i
wish
i
could
draw
said
meg
with
mingled
admiration
and
regret
in
her
voice
why
don't
you
learn
i
should
think
you
had
taste
and
talent
for
it
replied
miss
kate
graciously
i
haven't
time
your
mamma
prefers
other
accomplishments
i
fancy
so
did
mine
but
i
proved
to
her
that
i
had
talent
by
taking
a
few
lessons
privately
and
then
she
was
quite
willing
i
should
go
on
can't
you
do
the
same
with
your
governess
i
have
none
i
forgot
young
ladies
in
america
go
to
school
more
than
with
us
very
fine
schools
they
are
too
papa
says
you
go
to
a
private
one
i
suppose
i
don't
go
at
all
i
am
a
governess
myself
oh
indeed
said
miss
kate
but
she
might
as
well
have
said
dear
me
how
dreadful
for
her
tone
implied
it
and
something
in
her
face
made
meg
color
and
wish
she
had
not
been
so
frank
mr
brooke
looked
up
and
said
quickly
young
ladies
in
america
love
independence
as
much
as
their
ancestors
did
and
are
admired
and
respected
for
supporting
themselves
oh
yes
of
course
it's
very
nice
and
proper
in
them
to
do
so
we
have
many
most
respectable
and
worthy
young
women
who
do
the
same
and
are
employed
by
the
nobility
because
being
the
daughters
of
gentlemen
they
are
both
well-bred
and
accomplished
you
know
said
miss
kate
in
a
patronizing
tone
that
hurt
meg's
pride
and
made
her
work
seem
not
only
more
distasteful
but
degrading
did
the
german
song
suit
miss
march
inquired
mr
brooke
breaking
an
awkward
pause
oh
yes
it
was
very
sweet
and
i'm
much
obliged
to
whoever
translated
it
for
me
and
meg's
downcast
face
brightened
as
she
spoke
don't
you
read
german
asked
miss
kate
with
a
look
of
surprise
not
very
well
my
father
who
taught
me
is
away
and
i
don't
get
on
very
fast
alone
for
i've
no
one
to
correct
my
pronunciation
try
a
little
now
here
is
schiller's
'mary
stuart,'
and
a
tutor
who
loves
to
teach
and
mr
brooke
laid
his
book
on
her
lap
with
an
inviting
smile
it's
so
hard
i'm
afraid
to
try
said
meg
grateful
but
bashful
in
the
presence
of
the
accomplished
young
lady
beside
her
i'll
read
a
bit
to
encourage
you
and
miss
kate
read
one
of
the
most
beautiful
passages
in
a
perfectly
correct
but
perfectly
expressionless
manner
mr
brooke
made
no
comment
as
she
returned
the
book
to
meg
who
said
innocently,--
i
thought
it
was
poetry
some
of
it
is
try
this
passage
there
was
a
queer
smile
about
mr
brooke's
mouth
as
he
opened
at
poor
mary's
lament
meg
obediently
following
the
long
grass-blade
which
her
new
tutor
used
to
point
with
read
slowly
and
timidly
unconsciously
making
poetry
of
the
hard
words
by
the
soft
intonation
of
her
musical
voice
down
the
page
went
the
green
guide
and
presently
forgetting
her
listener
in
the
beauty
of
the
sad
scene
meg
read
as
if
alone
giving
a
little
touch
of
tragedy
to
the
words
of
the
unhappy
queen
if
she
had
seen
the
brown
eyes
then
she
would
have
stopped
short
but
she
never
looked
up
and
the
lesson
was
not
spoiled
for
her
very
well
indeed
said
mr
brooke
as
she
paused
quite
ignoring
her
many
mistakes
and
looking
as
if
he
did
indeed
love
to
teach
miss
kate
put
up
her
glass
and
having
taken
a
survey
of
the
little
tableau
before
her
shut
her
sketch-book
saying
with
condescension,--
illustration
miss
kate
put
up
her
glass
you've
a
nice
accent
and
in
time
will
be
a
clever
reader
i
advise
you
to
learn
for
german
is
a
valuable
accomplishment
to
teachers
i
must
look
after
grace
she
is
romping
and
miss
kate
strolled
away
adding
to
herself
with
a
shrug
i
didn't
come
to
chaperone
a
governess
though
she
_is_
young
and
pretty
what
odd
people
these
yankees
are
i'm
afraid
laurie
will
be
quite
spoilt
among
them
i
forgot
that
english
people
rather
turn
up
their
noses
at
governesses
and
don't
treat
them
as
we
do
said
meg
looking
after
the
retreating
figure
with
an
annoyed
expression
tutors
also
have
rather
a
hard
time
of
it
there
as
i
know
to
my
sorrow
there's
no
place
like
america
for
us
workers
miss
margaret
and
mr
brooke
looked
so
contented
and
cheerful
that
meg
was
ashamed
to
lament
her
hard
lot
i'm
glad
i
live
in
it
then
i
don't
like
my
work
but
i
get
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
out
of
it
after
all
so
i
won't
complain
i
only
wish
i
liked
teaching
as
you
do
i
think
you
would
if
you
had
laurie
for
a
pupil
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
lose
him
next
year
said
mr
brooke
busily
punching
holes
in
the
turf
going
to
college
i
suppose
meg's
lips
asked
that
question
but
her
eyes
added
and
what
becomes
of
you
yes
it's
high
time
he
went
for
he
is
ready
and
as
soon
as
he
is
off
i
shall
turn
soldier
i
am
needed
i
am
glad
of
that
exclaimed
meg
i
should
think
every
young
man
would
want
to
go
though
it
is
hard
for
the
mothers
and
sisters
who
stay
at
home
she
added
sorrowfully
i
have
neither
and
very
few
friends
to
care
whether
i
live
or
die
said
mr
brooke
rather
bitterly
as
he
absently
put
the
dead
rose
in
the
hole
he
had
made
and
covered
it
up
like
a
little
grave
laurie
and
his
grandfather
would
care
a
great
deal
and
we
should
all
be
very
sorry
to
have
any
harm
happen
to
you
said
meg
heartily
thank
you
that
sounds
pleasant
began
mr
brooke
looking
cheerful
again
but
before
he
could
finish
his
speech
ned
mounted
on
the
old
horse
came
lumbering
up
to
display
his
equestrian
skill
before
the
young
ladies
and
there
was
no
more
quiet
that
day
don't
you
love
to
ride
asked
grace
of
amy
as
they
stood
resting
after
a
race
round
the
field
with
the
others
led
by
ned
i
dote
upon
it
my
sister
meg
used
to
ride
when
papa
was
rich
but
we
don't
keep
any
horses
now
except
ellen
tree
added
amy
laughing
tell
me
about
ellen
tree
is
it
a
donkey
asked
grace
curiously
illustration
ellen
tree
why
you
see
jo
is
crazy
about
horses
and
so
am
i
but
we've
only
got
an
old
side-saddle
and
no
horse
out
in
our
garden
is
an
apple-tree
that
has
a
nice
low
branch
so
jo
put
the
saddle
on
it
fixed
some
reins
on
the
part
that
turns
up
and
we
bounce
away
on
ellen
tree
whenever
we
like
how
funny
laughed
grace
i
have
a
pony
at
home
and
ride
nearly
every
day
in
the
park
with
fred
and
kate
it's
very
nice
for
my
friends
go
too
and
the
row
is
full
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
dear
how
charming
i
hope
i
shall
go
abroad
some
day
but
i'd
rather
go
to
rome
than
the
row
said
amy
who
had
not
the
remotest
idea
what
the
row
was
and
wouldn't
have
asked
for
the
world
frank
sitting
just
behind
the
little
girls
heard
what
they
were
saying
and
pushed
his
crutch
away
from
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
as
he
watched
the
active
lads
going
through
all
sorts
of
comical
gymnastics
beth
who
was
collecting
the
scattered
author-cards
looked
up
and
said
in
her
shy
yet
friendly
way,--
i'm
afraid
you
are
tired
can
i
do
anything
for
you
talk
to
me
please
it's
dull
sitting
by
myself
answered
frank
who
had
evidently
been
used
to
being
made
much
of
at
home
if
he
had
asked
her
to
deliver
a
latin
oration
it
would
not
have
seemed
a
more
impossible
task
to
bashful
beth
but
there
was
no
place
to
run
to
no
jo
to
hide
behind
now
and
the
poor
boy
looked
so
wistfully
at
her
that
she
bravely
resolved
to
try
what
do
you
like
to
talk
about
she
asked
fumbling
over
the
cards
and
dropping
half
as
she
tried
to
tie
them
up
well
i
like
to
hear
about
cricket
and
boating
and
hunting
said
frank
who
had
not
yet
learned
to
suit
his
amusements
to
his
strength
my
heart
what
shall
i
do
i
don't
know
anything
about
them
thought
beth
and
forgetting
the
boy's
misfortune
in
her
flurry
she
said
hoping
to
make
him
talk
i
never
saw
any
hunting
but
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
i
did
once
but
i
can
never
hunt
again
for
i
got
hurt
leaping
a
confounded
five-barred
gate
so
there
are
no
more
horses
and
hounds
for
me
said
frank
with
a
sigh
that
made
beth
hate
herself
for
her
innocent
blunder
your
deer
are
much
prettier
than
our
ugly
buffaloes
she
said
turning
to
the
prairies
for
help
and
feeling
glad
that
she
had
read
one
of
the
boys'
books
in
which
jo
delighted
buffaloes
proved
soothing
and
satisfactory
and
in
her
eagerness
to
amuse
another
beth
forgot
herself
and
was
quite
unconscious
of
her
sisters'
surprise
and
delight
at
the
unusual
spectacle
of
beth
talking
away
to
one
of
the
dreadful
boys
against
whom
she
had
begged
protection
bless
her
heart
she
pities
him
so
she
is
good
to
him
said
jo
beaming
at
her
from
the
croquet-ground
i
always
said
she
was
a
little
saint
added
meg
as
if
there
could
be
no
further
doubt
of
it
i
haven't
heard
frank
laugh
so
much
for
ever
so
long
said
grace
to
amy
as
they
sat
discussing
dolls
and
making
tea-sets
out
of
the
acorn-cups
my
sister
beth
is
a
very
_fastidious_
girl
when
she
likes
to
be
said
amy
well
pleased
at
beth's
success
she
meant
fascinating
but
as
grace
didn't
know
the
exact
meaning
of
either
word
fastidious
sounded
well
and
made
a
good
impression
an
impromptu
circus
fox
and
geese
and
an
amicable
game
of
croquet
finished
the
afternoon
at
sunset
the
tent
was
struck
hampers
packed
wickets
pulled
up
boats
loaded
and
the
whole
party
floated
down
the
river
singing
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
ned
getting
sentimental
warbled
a
serenade
with
the
pensive
refrain,--
alone
alone
ah
woe
alone
and
at
the
lines--
we
each
are
young
we
each
have
a
heart
oh
why
should
we
stand
thus
coldly
apart
he
looked
at
meg
with
such
a
lackadaisical
expression
that
she
laughed
outright
and
spoilt
his
song
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
to
me
he
whispered
under
cover
of
a
lively
chorus
you've
kept
close
to
that
starched-up
englishwoman
all
day
and
now
you
snub
me
i
didn't
mean
to
but
you
looked
so
funny
i
really
couldn't
help
it
replied
meg
passing
over
the
first
part
of
his
reproach
for
it
was
quite
true
that
she
_had_
shunned
him
remembering
the
moffat
party
and
the
talk
after
it
ned
was
offended
and
turned
to
sallie
for
consolation
saying
to
her
rather
pettishly
there
isn't
a
bit
of
flirt
in
that
girl
is
there
not
a
particle
but
she's
a
dear
returned
sallie
defending
her
friend
even
while
confessing
her
short-comings
she's
not
a
stricken
deer
any
way
said
ned
trying
to
be
witty
and
succeeding
as
well
as
very
young
gentlemen
usually
do
on
the
lawn
where
it
had
gathered
the
little
party

with
cordial
good-nights
and
good-byes

the
vaughns

going
to
canada
as
the
four
sisters
went
home
through
the
garden
miss
kate
looked
after
them
saying
without
the
patronizing
tone
in
her
voice
in
spite
of
their
demonstrative
manners
american
girls
are
very
nice
when
one
knows
them
i
quite
agree
with
you

xiii
castles

laurie
lay
luxuriously
swinging
to
and
fro
in
his
hammock
one
warm
september
afternoon
wondering
what
his
neighbors
were
about
but
too
lazy
to
go
and
find
out
he
was
in
one
of
his
moods
for
the
day
had
been
both
unprofitable
and
unsatisfactory
and
he
was
wishing
he
could
live
it
over
again
the
hot
weather
made
him
indolent
and
he
had
shirked
his
studies
tried
mr
brooke's
patience
to
the
utmost
displeased
his
grandfather
by
practising
half
the
afternoon
frightened
the
maid-servants
half
out
of
their
wits
by
mischievously
hinting
that
one
of
his
dogs
was
going
mad
and
after
high
words
with
the
stable-man
about
some
fancied
neglect
of
his
horse
he
had
flung
himself
into
his
hammock
to
fume
over
the
stupidity
of
the
world
in
general
till
the
peace
of
the
lovely
day
quieted
him
in
spite
of
himself
staring
up
into
the
green
gloom
of
the
horse-chestnut
trees
above
him
he
dreamed
dreams
of
all
sorts
and
was
just
imagining
himself
tossing
on
the
ocean
in
a
voyage
round
the
world
when
the
sound
of
voices
brought
him
ashore
in
a
flash
peeping
through
the
meshes
of
the
hammock
he
saw
the
marches
coming
out
as
if
bound
on
some
expedition
what
in
the
world
are
those
girls
about
now
thought
laurie
opening
his
sleepy
eyes
to
take
a
good
look
for
there
was
something
rather
peculiar
in
the
appearance
of
his
neighbors
each
wore
a
large
flapping
hat
a
brown
linen
pouch
slung
over
one
shoulder
and
carried
a
long
staff
meg
had
a
cushion
jo
a
book
beth
a
basket
and
amy
a
portfolio
all
walked
quietly
through
the
garden
out
at
the
little
back
gate
and
began
to
climb
the
hill
that
lay
between
the
house
and
river
well
that's
cool
said
laurie
to
himself
to
have
a
picnic
and
never
ask
me
they
can't
be
going
in
the
boat
for
they
haven't
got
the
key
perhaps
they
forgot
it
i'll
take
it
to
them
and
see
what's
going
on
though
possessed
of
half
a
dozen
hats
it
took
him
some
time
to
find
one
then
there
was
a
hunt
for
the
key
which
was
at
last
discovered
in
his
pocket
so
that
the
girls
were
quite
out
of
sight
when
he
leaped
the
fence
and
ran
after
them
taking
the
shortest
way
to
the
boat-house
he
waited
for
them
to
appear
but
no
one
came
and
he
went
up
the
hill
to
take
an
observation
a
grove
of
pines
covered
one
part
of
it
and
from
the
heart
of
this
green
spot
came
a
clearer
sound
than
the
soft
sigh
of
the
pines
or
the
drowsy
chirp
of
the
crickets
here's
a
landscape
thought
laurie
peeping
through
the
bushes
and
looking
wide-awake
and
good-natured
already
it
_was_
rather
a
pretty
little
picture
for
the
sisters
sat
together
in
the
shady
nook
with
sun
and
shadow
flickering
over
them
the
aromatic
wind
lifting
their
hair
and
cooling
their
hot
cheeks
and
all
the
little
wood-people
going
on
with
their
affairs
as
if
these
were
no
strangers
but
old
friends
meg
sat
upon
her
cushion
sewing
daintily
with
her
white
hands
and
looking
as
fresh
and
sweet
as
a
rose
in
her
pink
dress
among
the
green
beth
was
sorting
the
cones
that
lay
thick
under
the
hemlock
near
by
for
she
made
pretty
things
of
them
amy
was
sketching
a
group
of
ferns
and
jo
was
knitting
as
she
read
aloud
a
shadow
passed
over
the
boy's
face
as
he
watched
them
feeling
that
he
ought
to
go
away
because
uninvited
yet
lingering
because
home
seemed
very
lonely
and
this
quiet
party
in
the
woods
most
attractive
to
his
restless
spirit
he
stood
so
still
that
a
squirrel
busy
with
its
harvesting
ran
down
a
pine
close
beside
him
saw
him
suddenly
and
skipped
back
scolding
so
shrilly
that
beth
looked
up
espied
the
wistful
face
behind
the
birches
and
beckoned
with
a
reassuring
smile
illustration
it
was
rather
a
pretty
little
picture
may
i
come
in
please
or
shall
i
be
a
bother
he
asked
advancing
slowly
meg
lifted
her
eyebrows
but
jo
scowled
at
her
defiantly
and
said
at
once
of
course
you
may
we
should
have
asked
you
before
only
we
thought
you
wouldn't
care
for
such
a
girl's
game
as
this
i
always
liked
your
games
but
if
meg
doesn't
want
me
i'll
go
away
i've
no
objection
if
you
do
something
it's
against
the
rules
to
be
idle
here
replied
meg
gravely
but
graciously
much
obliged
i'll
do
anything
if
you'll
let
me
stop
a
bit
for
it's
as
dull
as
the
desert
of
sahara
down
there
shall
i
sew
read
cone
draw
or
do
all
at
once
bring
on
your
bears
i'm
ready
and
laurie
sat
down
with
a
submissive
expression
delightful
to
behold
finish
this
story
while
i
set
my
heel
said
jo
handing
him
the
book
yes'm
was
the
meek
answer
as
he
began
doing
his
best
to
prove
his
gratitude
for
the
favor
of
an
admission
into
the
busy
bee
society
the
story
was
not
a
long
one
and
when
it
was
finished
he
ventured
to
ask
a
few
questions
as
a
reward
of
merit
please
ma'am
could
i
inquire
if
this
highly
instructive
and
charming
institution
is
a
new
one
would
you
tell
him
asked
meg
of
her
sisters
he'll
laugh
said
amy
warningly
who
cares
said
jo
i
guess
he'll
like
it
added
beth
of
course
i
shall
i
give
you
my
word
i
won't
laugh
tell
away
jo
and
don't
be
afraid
the
idea
of
being
afraid
of
you
well
you
see
we
used
to
play
'pilgrim's
progress,'
and
we
have
been
going
on
with
it
in
earnest
all
winter
and
summer
yes
i
know
said
laurie
nodding
wisely
who
told
you
demanded
jo
spirits
no
i
did
i
wanted
to
amuse
him
one
night
when
you
were
all
away
and
he
was
rather
dismal
he
did
like
it
so
don't
scold
jo
said
beth
meekly
you
can't
keep
a
secret
never
mind
it
saves
trouble
now
go
on
please
said
laurie
as
jo
became
absorbed
in
her
work
looking
a
trifle
displeased
oh
didn't
she
tell
you
about
this
new
plan
of
ours
well
we
have
tried
not
to
waste
our
holiday
but
each
has
had
a
task
and
worked
at
it
with
a
will
the
vacation
is
nearly
over
the
stints
are
all
done
and
we
are
ever
so
glad
that
we
didn't
dawdle
yes
i
should
think
so
and
laurie
thought
regretfully
of
his
own
idle
days
mother
likes
to
have
us
out
of
doors
as
much
as
possible
so
we
bring
our
work
here
and
have
nice
times
for
the
fun
of
it
we
bring
our
things
in
these
bags
wear
the
old
hats
use
poles
to
climb
the
hill
and
play
pilgrims
as
we
used
to
do
years
ago
we
call
this
hill
the
'delectable
mountain,'
for
we
can
look
far
away
and
see
the
country
where
we
hope
to
live
some
time
jo
pointed
and
laurie
sat
up
to
examine
for
through
an
opening
in
the
wood
one
could
look
across
the
wide
blue
river
the
meadows
on
the
other
side
far
over
the
outskirts
of
the
great
city
to
the
green
hills
that
rose
to
meet
the
sky
the
sun
was
low
and
the
heavens
plowed
with
the
splendor
of
an
autumn
sunset
gold
and
purple
clouds
lay
on
the
hill-tops
and
rising
high
into
the
ruddy
light
were
silvery
white
peaks
that
shone
like
the
airy
spires
of
some
celestial
city
how
beautiful
that
is
said
laurie
softly
for
he
was
quick
to
see
and
feel
beauty
of
any
kind
it's
often
so
and
we
like
to
watch
it
for
it
is
never
the
same
but
always
splendid
replied
amy
wishing
she
could
paint
it
jo
talks
about
the
country
where
we
hope
to
live
some
time,--the
real
country
she
means
with
pigs
and
chickens
and
haymaking
it
would
be
nice
but
i
wish
the
beautiful
country
up
there
was
real
and
we
could
ever
go
to
it
said
beth
musingly
there
is
a
lovelier
country
even
than
that
where
we
_shall_
go
by
and
by
when
we
are
good
enough
answered
meg
with
her
sweet
voice
it
seems
so
long
to
wait
so
hard
to
do
i
want
to
fly
away
at
once
as
those
swallows
fly
and
go
in
at
that
splendid
gate
you'll
get
there
beth
sooner
or
later
no
fear
of
that
said
jo
i'm
the
one
that
will
have
to
fight
and
work
and
climb
and
wait
and
maybe
never
get
in
after
all
you'll
have
me
for
company
if
that's
any
comfort
i
shall
have
to
do
a
deal
of
travelling
before
i
come
in
sight
of
your
celestial
city
if
i
arrive
late
you'll
say
a
good
word
for
me
won't
you
beth
something
in
the
boy's
face
troubled
his
little
friend
but
she
said
cheerfully
with
her
quiet
eyes
on
the
changing
clouds
if
people
really
want
to
go
and
really
try
all
their
lives
i
think
they
will
get
in
for
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
locks
on
that
door
or
any
guards
at
the
gate
i
always
imagine
it
is
as
it
is
in
the
picture
where
the
shining
ones
stretch
out
their
hands
to
welcome
poor
christian
as
he
comes
up
from
the
river
wouldn't
it
be
fun
if
all
the
castles
in
the
air
which
we
make
could
come
true
and
we
could
live
in
them
said
jo
after
a
little
pause
i've
made
such
quantities
it
would
be
hard
to
choose
which
i'd
have
said
laurie
lying
flat
and
throwing
cones
at
the
squirrel
who
had
betrayed
him
you'd
have
to
take
your
favorite
one
what
is
it
asked
meg
if
i
tell
mine
will
you
tell
yours
yes
if
the
girls
will
too
we
will
now
laurie
after
i'd
seen
as
much
of
the
world
as
i
want
to
i'd
like
to
settle
in
germany
and
have
just
as
much
music
as
i
choose
i'm
to
be
a
famous
musician
myself
and
all
creation
is
to
rush
to
hear
me
and
i'm
never
to
be
bothered
about
money
or
business
but
just
enjoy
myself
and
live
for
what
i
like
that's
my
favorite
castle
what's
yours
meg
margaret
seemed
to
find
it
a
little
hard
to
tell
hers
and
waved
a
brake
before
her
face
as
if
to
disperse
imaginary
gnats
while
she
said
slowly
i
should
like
a
lovely
house
full
of
all
sorts
of
luxurious
things,--nice
food
pretty
clothes
handsome
furniture
pleasant
people
and
heaps
of
money
i
am
to
be
mistress
of
it
and
manage
it
as
i
like
with
plenty
of
servants
so
i
never
need
work
a
bit
how
i
should
enjoy
it
for
i
wouldn't
be
idle
but
do
good
and
make
every
one
love
me
dearly

you

'pleasant
people,'

carefully
tied
up
her

so
that

i'd

what
but
i'm
on
the
watch

i
shall
write
books
and
get
rich

famous
that
would
suit

many

the
pet

artist
and
go
to

and
do
fine

wants
to

at

thought
of
a

little
secret

he
fancied
he
knew

colored
behind

expectant
expression

worn
when
he
told
the
story
of

ten
years

me
to
be
an
india
merchant
as
he
was
and
i'd
rather
be
shot
i
hate
tea
and
silk
and
spices
and
every
sort
of
rubbish
his
old
ships
bring
and
i
don't
care
how
soon
they
go
to
the
bottom
when
i
own
them
going
to
college
ought
to
satisfy
him
for
if
i
give
him
four
years
he
ought
to
let
me
off
from
the
business
but
he's
set
and
i
've
got
to
do
just
as
he
did
unless
i
break
away
and
please
myself
as
my
father
did
if
there
was
any
one
left
to
stay
with
the
old
gentleman
i'd
do
it
to-morrow
laurie
spoke
excitedly
and
looked
ready
to
carry
his
threat
into
execution
on
the
slightest
provocation
for
he
was
growing
up
very
fast
and
in
spite
of
his
indolent
ways
had
a
young
man's
hatred
of
subjection
a
young
man's
restless
longing
to
try
the
world
for
himself
i
advise
you
to
sail
away
in
one
of
your
ships
and
never
come
home
again
till
you
have
tried
your
own
way
said
jo
whose
imagination
was
fired
by
the
thought
of
such
a
daring
exploit
and
whose
sympathy
was
excited
by
what
she
called
teddy's
wrongs
that's
not
right
jo
you
mustn't
talk
in
that
way
and
laurie
mustn't
take
your
bad
advice
you
should
do
just
what
your
grandfather
wishes
my
dear
boy
said
meg
in
her
most
maternal
tone
do
your
best
at
college
and
when
he
sees
that
you
try
to
please
him
i'm
sure
he
won't
be
hard
or
unjust
to
you
as
you
say
there
is
no
one
else
to
stay
with
and
love
him
and
you'd
never
forgive
yourself
if
you
left
him
without
his
permission
don't
be
dismal
or
fret
but
do
your
duty
and
you'll
get
your
reward
as
good
mr
brooke
has
by
being
respected
and
loved
what
do
you
know
about
him
asked
laurie
grateful
for
the
good
advice
but
objecting
to
the
lecture
and
glad
to
turn
the
conversation
from
himself
after
his
unusual
outbreak
only
what
your
grandpa
told
us
about
him,--how
he
took
good
care
of
his
own
mother
till
she
died
and
wouldn't
go
abroad
as
tutor
to
some
nice
person
because
he
wouldn't
leave
her
and
how
he
provides
now
for
an
old
woman
who
nursed
his
mother
and
never
tells
any
one
but
is
just
as
generous
and
patient
and
good
as
he
can
be
so
he
is
dear
old
fellow
said
laurie
heartily
as
meg
paused
looking
flushed
and
earnest
with
her
story
it's
like
grandpa
to
find
out
all
about
him
without
letting
him
know
and
to
tell
all
his
goodness
to
others
so
that
they
might
like
him
brooke
couldn't
understand
why
your
mother
was
so
kind
to
him
asking
him
over
with
me
and
treating
him
in
her
beautiful
friendly
way
he
thought
she
was
just
perfect
and
talked
about
it
for
days
and
days
and
went
on
about
you
all
in
flaming
style
if
ever
i
do
get
my
wish
you
see
what
i'll
do
for
brooke
begin
to
do
something
now
by
not
plaguing
his
life
out
said
meg
sharply
how
do
you
know
i
do
miss
i
can
always
tell
by
his
face
when
he
goes
away
if
you
have
been
good
he
looks
satisfied
and
walks
briskly
if
you
have
plagued
him
he's
sober
and
walks
slowly
as
if
he
wanted
to
go
back
and
do
his
work
better
well
i
like
that
so
you
keep
an
account
of
my
good
and
bad
marks
in
brooke's
face
do
you
i
see
him
bow
and
smile
as
he
passes
your
window
but
i
didn't
know
you'd
got
up
a
telegraph
illustration
i
see
him
bow
and
smile
we
haven't
don't
be
angry
and
oh
don't
tell
him
i
said
anything
it
was
only
to
show
that
i
cared
how
you
get
on
and
what
is
said
here
is
said
in
confidence
you
know
cried
meg
much
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
what
might
follow
from
her
careless
speech
_i_
don't
tell
tales
replied
laurie
with
his
high
and
mighty
air
as
jo
called
a
certain
expression
which
he
occasionally
wore
only
if
brooke
is
going
to
be
a
thermometer
i
must
mind
and
have
fair
weather
for
him
to
report
please
don't
be
offended
i
didn't
mean
to
preach
or
tell
tales
or
be
silly
i
only
thought
jo
was
encouraging
you
in
a
feeling
which
you'd
be
sorry
for
by
and
by
you
are
so
kind
to
us
we
feel
as
if
you
were
our
brother
and
say
just
what
we
think
forgive
me
i
meant
it
kindly
and
meg
offered
her
hand
with
a
gesture
both
affectionate
and
timid
ashamed
of
his
momentary
pique
laurie
squeezed
the
kind
little
hand
and
said
frankly
i'm
the
one
to
be
forgiven
i'm
cross
and
have
been
out
of
sorts
all
day
i
like
to
have
you
tell
me
my
faults
and
be
sisterly
so
don't
mind
if
i
am
grumpy
sometimes
i
thank
you
all
the
same
bent
on
showing
that
he
was
not
offended
he
made
himself
as
agreeable
as
possible,--wound
cotton
for
meg
recited
poetry
to
please
jo
shook
down
cones
for
beth
and
helped
amy
with
her
ferns
proving
himself
a
fit
person
to
belong
to
the
busy
bee
society
in
the
midst
of
an
animated
discussion
on
the
domestic
habits
of
turtles
one
of
those
amiable
creatures
having
strolled
up
from
the
river
the
faint
sound
of
a
bell
warned
them
that
hannah
had
put
the
tea
to
draw
and
they
would
just
have
time
to
get
home
to
supper
may
i
come
again
asked
laurie
yes
if
you
are
good
and
love
your
book
as
the
boys
in
the
primer
are
told
to
do
said
meg
smiling
i'll
try
then
you
may
come
and
i'll
teach
you
to
knit
as
the
scotchmen
do
there's
a
demand
for
socks
just
now
added
jo
waving
hers
like
a
big
blue
worsted
banner
as
they
parted
at
the
gate
that
night
when
beth
played
to
mr
laurence
in
the
twilight
laurie
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
curtain
listened
to
the
little
david
whose
simple
music
always
quieted
his
moody
spirit
and
watched
the
old
man
who
sat
with
his
gray
head
on
his
hand
thinking
tender
thoughts
of
the
dead
child
he
had
loved
so
much
remembering
the
conversation
of
the
afternoon
the
boy
said
to
himself
with
the
resolve
to
make
the
sacrifice
cheerfully
i'll
let
my
castle
go
and
stay
with
the
dear
old
gentleman
while
he
needs
me
for
i
am
all
he
has
illustration
tail-piece

jo
was
very
busy
xiv
secrets
jo
was
very
busy
in
the
garret
for
the
october
days
began
to
grow
chilly
and
the
afternoons
were
short
for
two
or
three
hours
the
sun
lay
warmly
in
the
high
window
showing
jo
seated
on
the
old
sofa
writing
busily
with
her
papers
spread
out
upon
a
trunk
before
her
while
scrabble
the
pet
rat
promenaded
the
beams
overhead
accompanied
by
his
oldest
son
a
fine
young
fellow
who
was
evidently
very
proud
of
his
whiskers
quite
absorbed
in
her
work
jo
scribbled
away
till
the
last
page
was
filled
when
she
signed
her
name
with
a
flourish
and
threw
down
her
pen
exclaiming,--
there
i've
done
my
best
if
this
won't
suit
i
shall
have
to
wait
till
i
can
do
better
lying
back
on
the
sofa
she
read
the
manuscript
carefully
through
making
dashes
here
and
there
and
putting
in
many
exclamation
points
which
looked
like
little
balloons
then
she
tied
it
up
with
a
smart
red
ribbon
and
sat
a
minute
looking
at
it
with
a
sober
wistful
expression
which
plainly
showed
how
earnest
her
work
had
been
jo's
desk
up
here
was
an
old
tin
kitchen
which
hung
against
the
wall
in
it
she
kept
her
papers
and
a
few
books
safely
shut
away
from
scrabble
who
being
likewise
of
a
literary
turn
was
fond
of
making
a
circulating
library
of
such
books
as
were
left
in
his
way
by
eating
the
leaves
from
this
tin
receptacle
jo
produced
another
manuscript
and
putting
both
in
her
pocket
crept
quietly
down
stairs
leaving
her
friends
to
nibble
her
pens
and
taste
her
ink
she
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
as
noiselessly
as
possible
and
going
to
the
back
entry
window
got
out
upon
the
roof
of
a
low
porch
swung
herself
down
to
the
grassy
bank
and
took
a
roundabout
way
to
the
road
once
there
she
composed
herself
hailed
a
passing
omnibus
and
rolled
away
to
town
looking
very
merry
and
mysterious
if
any
one
had
been
watching
her
he
would
have
thought
her
movements
decidedly
peculiar
for
on
alighting
she
went
off
at
a
great
pace
till
she
reached
a
certain
number
in
a
certain
busy
street
having
found
the
place
with
some
difficulty
she
went
into
the
door-way
looked
up
the
dirty
stairs
and
after
standing
stock
still
a
minute
suddenly
dived
into
the
street
and
walked
away
as
rapidly
as
she
came
this
manœuvre
she
repeated
several
times
to
the
great
amusement
of
a
black-eyed
young
gentleman
lounging
in
the
window
of
a
building
opposite
on
returning
for
the
third
time
jo
gave
herself
a
shake
pulled
her
hat
over
her
eyes
and
walked
up
the
stairs
looking
as
if
she
were
going
to
have
all
her
teeth
out
there
was
a
dentist's
sign
among
others
which
adorned
the
entrance
and
after
staring
a
moment
at
the
pair
of
artificial
jaws
which
slowly
opened
and
shut
to
draw
attention
to
a
fine
set
of
teeth
the
young
gentleman
put
on
his
coat
took
his
hat
and
went
down
to
post
himself
in
the
opposite
door-way
saying
with
a
smile
and
a
shiver,--
it's
like
her
to
come
alone
but
if
she
has
a
bad
time
she'll
need
some
one
to
help
her
home
in
ten
minutes
jo
came
running
down
stairs
with
a
very
red
face
and
the
general
appearance
of
a
person
who
had
just
passed
through
a
trying
ordeal
of
some
sort
when
she
saw
the
young
gentleman
she
looked
anything
but
pleased
and
passed
him
with
a
nod
but
he
followed
asking
with
an
air
of
sympathy,--
did
you
have
a
bad
time
not
very
you
got
through
quickly
yes
thank
goodness
why
did
you
go
alone
didn't
want
any
one
to
know
you're
the
oddest
fellow
i
ever
saw
how
many
did
you
have
out
jo
looked
at
her
friend
as
if
she
did
not
understand
him
then
began
to
laugh
as
if
mightily
amused
at
something
there
are
two
which
i
want
to
have
come
out
but
i
must
wait
a
week
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
are
up
to
some
mischief
jo
said
laurie
looking
mystified
so
are
you
what
were
you
doing
sir
up
in
that
billiard
saloon
begging
your
pardon
ma'am
it
wasn't
a
billiard
saloon
but
a
gymnasium
and
i
was
taking
a
lesson
in
fencing
i'm
glad
of
that
why
you
can
teach
me
and
then
when
we
play
hamlet
you
can
be
laertes
and
we'll
make
a
fine
thing
of
the
fencing
scene
laurie
burst
out
with
a
hearty
boy's
laugh
which
made
several
passers-by
smile
in
spite
of
themselves
i'll
teach
you
whether
we
play
hamlet
or
not
it's
grand
fun
and
will
straighten
you
up
capitally
but
i
don't
believe
that
was
your
only
reason
for
saying
'i'm
glad,'
in
that
decided
way
was
it
now
no
i
was
glad
that
you
were
not
in
the
saloon
because
i
hope
you
never
go
to
such
places
do
you
not
often
i
wish
you
wouldn't
it's
no
harm
jo
i
have
billiards
at
home
but
it's
no
fun
unless
you
have
good
players
so
as
i'm
fond
of
it
i
come
sometimes
and
have
a
game
with
ned
moffat
or
some
of
the
other
fellows
oh
dear
i'm
so
sorry
for
you'll
get
to
liking
it
better
and
better
and
will
waste
time
and
money
and
grow
like
those
dreadful
boys
i
did
hope
you'd
stay
respectable
and
be
a
satisfaction
to
your
friends
said
jo
shaking
her
head
can't
a
fellow
take
a
little
innocent
amusement
now
and
then
without
losing
his
respectability
asked
laurie
looking
nettled
that
depends
upon
how
and
where
he
takes
it
i
don't
like
ned
and
his
set
and
wish
you'd
keep
out
of
it
mother
won't
let
us
have
him
at
our
house
though
he
wants
to
come
and
if
you
grow
like
him
she
won't
be
willing
to
have
us
frolic
together
as
we
do
now
won't
she
asked
laurie
anxiously
no
she
can't
bear
fashionable
young
men
and
she'd
shut
us
all
up
in
bandboxes
rather
than
have
us
associate
with
them
well
she
needn't
get
out
her
bandboxes
yet
i'm
not
a
fashionable
party
and
don't
mean
to
be
but
i
do
like
harmless
larks
now
and
then
don't
you
yes
nobody
minds
them
so
lark
away
but
don't
get
wild
will
you
or
there
will
be
an
end
of
all
our
good
times
i'll
be
a
double-distilled
saint
i
can't
bear
saints
just
be
a
simple
honest
respectable
boy
and
we'll
never
desert
you
i
don't
know
what
i
_should_
do
if
you
acted
like
mr
king's
son
he
had
plenty
of
money
but
didn't
know
how
to
spend
it
and
got
tipsy
and
gambled
and
ran
away
and
forged
his
father's
name
i
believe
and
was
altogether
horrid
you
think
i'm
likely
to
do
the
same
much
obliged
no
i
don't--oh
_dear_
no!--but
i
hear
people
talking
about
money
being
such
a
temptation
and
i
sometimes
wish
you
were
poor
i
shouldn't
worry
then
do
you
worry
about
me
jo
a
little
when
you
look
moody
or
discontented
as
you
sometimes
do
for
you've
got
such
a
strong
will
if
you
once
get
started
wrong
i'm
afraid
it
would
be
hard
to
stop
you
laurie
walked
in
silence
a
few
minutes
and
jo
watched
him
wishing
she
had
held
her
tongue
for
his
eyes
looked
angry
though
his
lips
still
smiled
as
if
at
her
warnings
are
you
going
to
deliver
lectures
all
the
way
home
he
asked
presently
of
course
not
why
because
if
you
are
i'll
take
a
'bus
if
you
are
not
i'd
like
to
walk
with
you
and
tell
you
something
very
interesting
i
won't
preach
any
more
and
i'd
like
to
hear
the
news
immensely
very
well
then
come
on
it's
a
secret
and
if
i
tell
you
you
must
tell
me
yours
i
haven't
got
any
began
jo
but
stopped
suddenly
remembering
that
she
had
you
know
you
have,--you
can't
hide
anything
so
up
and
'fess
or
i
won't
tell
cried
laurie
is
your
secret
a
nice
one
oh
isn't
it
all
about
people
you
know
and
such
fun
you
ought
to
hear
it
and
i've
been
aching
to
tell
it
this
long
time
come
you
begin
you'll
not
say
anything
about
it
at
home
will
you
not
a
word
and
you
won't
tease
me
in
private
i
never
tease
yes
you
do
you
get
everything
you
want
out
of
people
i
don't
know
how
you
do
it
but
you
are
a
born
wheedler
thank
you
fire
away
well
i've
left
two
stories
with
a
newspaper
man
and
he's
to
give
his
answer
next
week
whispered
jo
in
her
confidant's
ear
hurrah
for
miss
march
the
celebrated
american
authoress
cried
laurie
throwing
up
his
hat
and
catching
it
again
to
the
great
delight
of
two
ducks
four
cats
five
hens
and
half
a
dozen
irish
children

they
were

of

hurrah
for
miss
march
hush
it
won't
come
to
anything
i
dare
say
but
i
couldn't
rest
till
i
had
tried
and
i
said
nothing
about
it
because
i
didn't
want
any
one
else
to
be
disappointed
it
won't
fail
why
jo
your
stories
are
works
of
shakespeare
compared
to
half
the
rubbish
that
is
published
every
day
won't
it
be
fun
to
see
them
in
print
and
sha'n't
we
feel
proud
of
our
authoress
jo's
eyes
sparkled
for
it
is
always
pleasant
to
be
believed
in
and
a
friend's
praise
is
always
sweeter
than
a
dozen
newspaper
puffs
where's
_your_
secret
play
fair
teddy
or
i'll
never
believe
you
again
she
said
trying
to
extinguish
the
brilliant
hopes
that
blazed
up
at
a
word
of
encouragement
i
may
get
into
a
scrape
for
telling
but
i
didn't
promise
not
to
so
i
will
for
i
never
feel
easy
in
my
mind
till
i've
told
you
any
plummy
bit
of
news
i
get
i
know
where
meg's
glove
is
is
that
all
said
jo
looking
disappointed
as
laurie
nodded
and
twinkled
with
a
face
full
of
mysterious
intelligence
it's
quite
enough
for
the
present
as
you'll
agree
when
i
tell
you
where
it
is
tell
then
laurie
bent
and
whispered
three
words
in
jo's
ear
which
produced
a
comical
change
she
stood
and
stared
at
him
for
a
minute
looking
both
surprised
and
displeased
then
walked
on
saying
sharply
how
do
you
know
saw
it
where
pocket
all
this
time
yes
isn't
that
romantic
no
it's
horrid
don't
you
like
it
of
course
i
don't
it's
ridiculous
it
won't
be
allowed
my
patience
what
would
meg
say
you
are
not
to
tell
any
one
mind
that
i
didn't
promise
that
was
understood
and
i
trusted
you
well
i
won't
for
the
present
any
way
but
i'm
disgusted
and
wish
you
hadn't
told
me
i
thought
you'd
be
pleased
at
the
idea
of
anybody
coming
to
take
meg
away
no
thank
you
you'll
feel
better
about
it
when
somebody
comes
to
take
you
away
i'd
like
to
see
any
one
try
it
cried
jo
fiercely
so
should
i
and
laurie
chuckled
at
the
idea
i
don't
think
secrets
agree
with
me
i
feel
rumpled
up
in
my
mind
since
you
told
me
that
said
jo
rather
ungratefully
race
down
this
hill
with
me
and
you'll
be
all
right
suggested
laurie
no
one
was
in
sight
the
smooth
road
sloped
invitingly
before
her
and
finding
the
temptation
irresistible
jo
darted
away
soon
leaving
hat
and
comb
behind
her
and
scattering
hair-pins
as
she
ran
laurie
reached
the
goal
first
and
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
success
of
his
treatment
for
his
atalanta
came
panting
up
with
flying
hair
bright
eyes
ruddy
cheeks
and
no
signs
of
dissatisfaction
in
her
face
illustration
jo
darted
away
i
wish
i
was
a
horse
then
i
could
run
for
miles
in
this
splendid
air
and
not
lose
my
breath
it
was
capital
but
see
what
a
guy
it's
made
me
go
pick
up
my
things
like
a
cherub
as
you
are
said
jo
dropping
down
under
a
maple-tree
which
was
carpeting
the
bank
with
crimson
leaves
laurie
leisurely
departed
to
recover
the
lost
property
and
jo
bundled
up
her
braids
hoping
no
one
would
pass
by
till
she
was
tidy
again
but
some
one
did
pass
and
who
should
it
be
but
meg
looking
particularly
ladylike
in
her
state
and
festival
suit
for
she
had
been
making
calls
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
she
asked
regarding
her
dishevelled
sister
with
well-bred
surprise
getting
leaves
meekly
answered
jo
sorting
the
rosy
handful
she
had
just
swept
up
and
hair-pins
added
laurie
throwing
half
a
dozen
into
jo's
lap
they
grow
on
this
road
meg
so
do
combs
and
brown
straw
hats
you
have
been
running
jo
how
could
you
when
_will_
you
stop
such
romping
ways
said
meg
reprovingly
as
she
settled
her
cuffs
and
smoothed
her
hair
with
which
the
wind
had
taken
liberties
never
till
i'm
stiff
and
old
and
have
to
use
a
crutch
don't
try
to
make
me
grow
up
before
my
time
meg
it's
hard
enough
to
have
you
change
all
of
a
sudden
let
me
be
a
little
girl
as
long
as
i
can
as
she
spoke
jo
bent
over
the
leaves
to
hide
the
trembling
of
her
lips
for
lately
she
had
felt
that
margaret
was
fast
getting
to
be
a
woman
and
laurie's
secret
made
her
dread
the
separation
which
must
surely
come
some
time
and
now
seemed
very
near
he
saw
the
trouble
in
her
face
and
drew
meg's
attention
from
it
by
asking
quickly
where
have
you
been
calling
all
so
fine
at
the
gardiners'
and
sallie
has
been
telling
me
all
about
belle
moffat's
wedding
it
was
very
splendid
and
they
have
gone
to
spend
the
winter
in
paris
just
think
how
delightful
that
must
be
do
you
envy
her
meg
said
laurie
i'm
afraid
i
do
i'm
glad
of
it
muttered
jo
tying
on
her
hat
with
a
jerk
why
asked
meg
looking
surprised
because
if
you
care
much
about
riches
you
will
never
go
and
marry
a
poor
man
said
jo
frowning
at
laurie
who
was
mutely
warning
her
to
mind
what
she
said
i
shall
never
'_go_
and
marry'
any
one
observed
meg
walking
on
with
great
dignity
while
the
others
followed
laughing
whispering
skipping
stones
and
behaving
like
children
as
meg
said
to
herself
though
she
might
have
been
tempted
to
join
them
if
she
had
not
had
her
best
dress
on
for
a
week
or
two
jo
behaved
so
queerly
that
her
sisters
were
quite
bewildered
she
rushed
to
the
door
when
the
postman
rang
was
rude
to
mr
brooke
whenever
they
met
would
sit
looking
at
meg
with
a
woe-begone
face
occasionally
jumping
up
to
shake
and
then
to
kiss
her
in
a
very
mysterious
manner
laurie
and
she
were
always
making
signs
to
one
another
and
talking
about
spread
eagles
till
the
girls
declared
they
had
both
lost
their
wits
on
the
second
saturday
after
jo
got
out
of
the
window
meg
as
she
sat
sewing
at
her
window
was
scandalized
by
the
sight
of
laurie
chasing
jo
all
over
the
garden
and
finally
capturing
her
in
amy's
bower
what
went
on
there
meg
could
not
see
but
shrieks
of
laughter
were
heard
followed
by
the
murmur
of
voices
and
a
great
flapping
of
newspapers
what
shall
we
do
with
that
girl
she
never
_will_
behave
like
a
young
lady
sighed
meg
as
she
watched
the
race
with
a
disapproving
face
i
hope
she
won't
she
is
so
funny
and
dear
as
she
is
said
beth
who
had
never
betrayed
that
she
was
a
little
hurt
at
jo's
having
secrets
with
any
one
but
her
it's
very
trying
but
we
never
can
make
her
_commy
la
fo_
added
amy
who
sat
making
some
new
frills
for
herself
with
her
curls
tied
up
in
a
very
becoming
way,--two
agreeable
things
which
made
her
feel
unusually
elegant
and
ladylike
in
a
few
minutes
jo
bounced
in
laid
herself
on
the
sofa
and
affected
to
read
illustration
jo
laid
herself
on
the
sofa
and
affected
to
read
have
you
anything
interesting
there
asked
meg
with
condescension
nothing
but
a
story
won't
amount
to
much
i
guess
returned
jo
carefully
keeping
the
name
of
the
paper
out
of
sight
you'd
better
read
it
aloud
that
will
amuse
us
and
keep
you
out
of
mischief
said
amy
in
her
most
grown-up
tone
what's
the
name
asked
beth
wondering
why
jo
kept
her
face
behind
the
sheet
the
rival
painters
that
sounds
well
read
it
said
meg
with
a
loud
hem
and
a
long
breath
jo
began
to
read
very
fast
the
girls
listened
with
interest
for
the
tale
was
romantic
and
somewhat
pathetic
as
most
of
the
characters
died
in
the
end
i
like
that
about
the
splendid
picture
was
amy's
approving
remark
as
jo
paused
i
prefer
the
lovering
part
viola
and
angelo
are
two
of
our
favorite
names
isn't
that
queer
said
meg
wiping
her
eyes
for
the
lovering
part
was
tragical
who
wrote
it
asked
beth
who
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
jo's
face
the
reader
suddenly
sat
up
cast
away
the
paper
displaying
a
flushed
countenance
and
with
a
funny
mixture
of
solemnity
and
excitement
replied
in
a
loud
voice
your
sister
you
cried
meg
dropping
her
work
it's
very
good
said
amy
critically
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
o
my
jo
i
_am_
so
proud
and
beth
ran
to
hug
her
sister
and
exult
over
this
splendid
success
dear
me
how
delighted
they
all
were
to
be
sure
how
meg
wouldn't
believe
it
till
she
saw
the
words
miss
josephine
march
actually
printed
in
the
paper
how
graciously
amy
criticised
the
artistic
parts
of
the
story
and
offered
hints
for
a
sequel
which
unfortunately
couldn't
be
carried
out
as
the
hero
and
heroine
were
dead
how
beth
got
excited
and
skipped
and
sung
with
joy
how
hannah
came
in
to
exclaim
sakes
alive
well
i
never
in
great
astonishment
at
that
jo's
doin's
how
proud
mrs
march
was
when
she
knew
it
how
jo
laughed
with
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
declared
she
might
as
well
be
a
peacock
and
done
with
it
and
how
the
spread
eagle
might
be
said
to
flap
his
wings
triumphantly
over
the
house
of
march
as
the
paper
passed
from
hand
to
hand
tell
us
all
about
it
when
did
it
come
how
much
did
you
get
for
it
what
_will_
father
say
won't
laurie
laugh
cried
the
family
all
in
one
breath
as
they
clustered
about
jo
for
these
foolish
affectionate
people
made
a
jubilee
of
every
little
household
joy
stop
jabbering
girls
and
i'll
tell
you
everything
said
jo
wondering
if
miss
burney
felt
any
grander
over
her
evelina
than
she
did
over
her
rival
painters
having
told
how
she
disposed
of
her
tales
jo
added
and
when
i
went
to
get
my
answer
the
man
said
he
liked
them
both
but
didn't
pay
beginners
only
let
them
print
in
his
paper
and
noticed
the
stories
it
was
good
practice
he
said
and
when
the
beginners
improved
any
one
would
pay
so
i
let
him
have
the
two
stories
and
to-day
this
was
sent
to
me
and
laurie
caught
me
with
it
and
insisted
on
seeing
it
so
i
let
him
and
he
said
it
was
good
and
i
shall
write
more
and
he's
going
to
get
the
next
paid
for
and
i
_am_
so
happy
for
in
time
i
may
be
able
to
support
myself
and
help
the
girls
jo's
breath
gave
out
here
and
wrapping
her
head
in
the
paper
she
bedewed
her
little
story
with
a
few
natural
tears
for
to
be
independent
and
earn
the
praise
of
those
she
loved
were
the
dearest
wishes
of
her
heart
and
this
seemed
to
be
the
first
step
toward
that
happy
end
xv
a
telegram
illustration
november
is
the
most
disagreeable
month
in
the
year
november
is
the
most
disagreeable
month
in
the
whole
year
said
margaret
standing
at
the
window
one
dull
afternoon
looking
out
at
the
frost-bitten
garden
that's
the
reason
i
was
born
in
it
observed
jo
pensively
quite
unconscious
of
the
blot
on
her
nose
if
something
very
pleasant
should
happen
now
we
should
think
it
a
delightful
month
said
beth
who
took
a
hopeful
view
of
everything
even
november
i
dare
say
but
nothing
pleasant
ever
_does_
happen
in
this
family
said
meg
who
was
out
of
sorts
we
go
grubbing
along
day
after
day
without
a
bit
of
change
and
very
little
fun
we
might
as
well
be
in
a
treadmill
my
patience
how
blue
we
are
cried
jo
i
don't
much
wonder
poor
dear
for
you
see
other
girls
having
splendid
times
while
you
grind
grind
year
in
and
year
out
oh
don't
i
wish
i
could
manage
things
for
you
as
i
do
for
my
heroines
you're
pretty
enough
and
good
enough
already
so
i'd
have
some
rich
relation
leave
you
a
fortune
unexpectedly
then
you'd
dash
out
as
an
heiress
scorn
every
one
who
has
slighted
you
go
abroad
and
come
home
my
lady
something
in
a
blaze
of
splendor
and
elegance
people
don't
have
fortunes
left
them
in
that
style
now-a-days
men
have
to
work
and
women
to
marry
for
money
it's
a
dreadfully
unjust
world
said
meg
bitterly
jo
and
i
are
going
to
make
fortunes
for
you
all
just
wait
ten
years
and
see
if
we
don't
said
amy
who
sat
in
a
corner
making
mud
pies
as
hannah
called
her
little
clay
models
of
birds
fruit
and
faces
can't
wait
and
i'm
afraid
i
haven't
much
faith
in
ink
and
dirt
though
i'm
grateful
for
your
good
intentions
meg
sighed
and
turned
to
the
frost-bitten
garden
again
jo
groaned
and
leaned
both
elbows
on
the
table
in
a
despondent
attitude
but
amy
spatted
away
energetically
and
beth
who
sat
at
the
other
window
said
smiling
two
pleasant
things
are
going
to
happen
right
away
marmee
is
coming
down
the
street
and
laurie
is
tramping
through
the
garden
as
if
he
had
something
nice
to
tell
in
they
both
came
mrs
march
with
her
usual
question
any
letter
from
father
girls
and
laurie
to
say
in
his
persuasive
way
won't
some
of
you
come
for
a
drive
i've
been
working
away
at
mathematics
till
my
head
is
in
a
muddle
and
i'm
going
to
freshen
my
wits
by
a
brisk
turn
it's
a
dull
day
but
the
air
isn't
bad
and
i'm
going
to
take
brooke
home
so
it
will
be
gay
inside
if
it
isn't
out
come
jo
you
and
beth
will
go
won't
you
of
course
we
will
much
obliged
but
i'm
busy
and
meg
whisked
out
her
work-basket
for
she
had
agreed
with
her
mother
that
it
was
best
for
her
at
least
not
to
drive
often
with
the
young
gentleman
we
three
will
be
ready
in
a
minute
cried
amy
running
away
to
wash
her
hands
can
i
do
anything
for
you
madam
mother
asked
laurie
leaning
over
mrs
march's
chair
with
the
affectionate
look
and
tone
he
always
gave
her
no
thank
you
except
call
at
the
office
if
you'll
be
so
kind
dear
it's
our
day
for
a
letter
and
the
postman
hasn't
been
father
is
as
regular
as
the
sun
but
there's
some
delay
on
the
way
perhaps
a
sharp
ring
interrupted
her
and
a
minute
after
hannah
came
in
with
a
letter
it's
one
of
them
horrid
telegraph
things
mum
she
said
handing
it
as
if
she
was
afraid
it
would
explode
and
do
some
damage
illustration
one
of
them
horrid
telegraph
things
at
the
word
telegraph
mrs
march
snatched
it
read
the
two
lines
it
contained
and
dropped
back
into
her
chair
as
white
as
if
the
little
paper
had
sent
a
bullet
to
her
heart
laurie
dashed
down
stairs
for
water
while
meg
and
hannah
supported
her
and
jo
read
aloud
in
a
frightened
voice,--
mrs
march
your
husband
is
very
ill
come
at
once
s
hale
blank
hospital
washington
how
still
the
room
was
as
they
listened
breathlessly
how
strangely
the
day
darkened
outside
and
how
suddenly
the
whole
world
seemed
to
change
as
the
girls
gathered
about
their
mother
feeling
as
if
all
the
happiness
and
support
of
their
lives
was
about
to
be
taken
from
them
mrs
march
was
herself
again
directly
read
the
message
over
and
stretched
out
her
arms
to
her
daughters
saying
in
a
tone
they
never
forgot
i
shall
go
at
once
but
it
may
be
too
late
o
children
children
help
me
to
bear
it
for
several
minutes
there
was
nothing
but
the
sound
of
sobbing
in
the
room
mingled
with
broken
words
of
comfort
tender
assurances
of
help
and
hopeful
whispers
that
died
away
in
tears
poor
hannah
was
the
first
to
recover
and
with
unconscious
wisdom
she
set
all
the
rest
a
good
example
for
with
her
work
was
the
panacea
for
most
afflictions
the
lord
keep
the
dear
man
i
won't
waste
no
time
a
cryin'
but
git
your
things
ready
right
away
mum
she
said
heartily
as
she
wiped
her
face
on
her
apron
gave
her
mistress
a
warm
shake
of
the
hand
with
her
own
hard
one
and
went
away
to
work
like
three
women
in
one
she's
right
there's
no
time
for
tears
now
be
calm
girls
and
let
me
think
they
tried
to
be
calm
poor
things
as
their
mother
sat
up
looking
pale
but
steady
and
put
away
her
grief
to
think
and
plan
for
them
where's
laurie
she
asked
presently
when
she
had
collected
her
thoughts
and
decided
on
the
first
duties
to
be
done
here
ma'am
oh
let
me
do
something
cried
the
boy
hurrying
from
the
next
room
whither
he
had
withdrawn
feeling
that
their
first
sorrow
was
too
sacred
for
even
his
friendly
eyes
to
see
send
a
telegram
saying
i
will
come
at
once
the
next
train
goes
early
in
the
morning
i'll
take
that
what
else
the
horses
are
ready
i
can
go
anywhere
do
anything
he
said
looking
ready
to
fly
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
leave
a
note
at
aunt
march's
jo
give
me
that
pen
and
paper
tearing
off
the
blank
side
of
one
of
her
newly
copied
pages
jo
drew
the
table
before
her
mother
well
knowing
that
money
for
the
long
sad
journey
must
be
borrowed
and
feeling
as
if
she
could
do
anything
to
add
a
little
to
the
sum
for
her
father
now
go
dear
but
don't
kill
yourself
driving
at
a
desperate
pace
there
is
no
need
of
that
mrs
march's
warning
was
evidently
thrown
away
for
five
minutes
later
laurie
tore
by
the
window
on
his
own
fleet
horse
riding
as
if
for
his
life
jo
run
to
the
rooms
and
tell
mrs
king
that
i
can't
come
on
the
way
get
these
things
i'll
put
them
down
they'll
be
needed
and
i
must
go
prepared
for
nursing
hospital
stores
are
not
always
good
beth
go
and
ask
mr
laurence
for
a
couple
of
bottles
of
old
wine
i'm
not
too
proud
to
beg
for
father
he
shall
have
the
best
of
everything
amy
tell
hannah
to
get
down
the
black
trunk
and
meg
come
and
help
me
find
my
things
for
i'm
half
bewildered
writing
thinking
and
directing
all
at
once
might
well
bewilder
the
poor
lady
and
meg
begged
her
to
sit
quietly
in
her
room
for
a
little
while
and
let
them
work
every
one
scattered
like
leaves
before
a
gust
of
wind
and
the
quiet
happy
household
was
broken
up
as
suddenly
as
if
the
paper
had
been
an
evil
spell
mr
laurence
came
hurrying
back
with
beth
bringing
every
comfort
the
kind
old
gentleman
could
think
of
for
the
invalid
and
friendliest
promises
of
protection
for
the
girls
during
the
mother's
absence
which
comforted
her
very
much
there
was
nothing
he
didn't
offer
from
his
own
dressing-gown
to
himself
as
escort
but
that
last
was
impossible
mrs
march
would
not
hear
of
the
old
gentleman's
undertaking
the
long
journey
yet
an
expression
of
relief
was
visible
when
he
spoke
of
it
for
anxiety
ill
fits
one
for
travelling
he
saw
the
look
knit
his
heavy
eyebrows
rubbed
his
hands
and
marched
abruptly
away
saying
he'd
be
back
directly
no
one
had
time
to
think
of
him
again
till
as
meg
ran
through
the
entry
with
a
pair
of
rubbers
in
one
hand
and
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
other
she
came
suddenly
upon
mr
brooke
illustration
she
came
suddenly
upon
mr
brooke
i'm
very
sorry
to
hear
of
this
miss
march
he
said
in
the
kind
quiet
tone
which
sounded
very
pleasantly
to
her
perturbed
spirit
i
came
to
offer
myself
as
escort
to
your
mother
mr
laurence
has
commissions
for
me
in
washington
and
it
will
give
me
real
satisfaction
to
be
of
service
to
her
there
down
dropped
the
rubbers
and
the
tea
was
very
near
following
as
meg
put
out
her
hand
with
a
face
so
full
of
gratitude
that
mr
brooke
would
have
felt
repaid
for
a
much
greater
sacrifice
than
the
trifling
one
of
time
and
comfort
which
he
was
about
to
make
how
kind
you
all
are
mother
will
accept
i'm
sure
and
it
will
be
such
a
relief
to
know
that
she
has
some
one
to
take
care
of
her
thank
you
very
very
much
meg
spoke
earnestly
and
forgot
herself
entirely
till
something
in
the
brown
eyes
looking
down
at
her
made
her
remember
the
cooling
tea
and
lead
the
way
into
the
parlor
saying
she
would
call
her
mother
everything
was
arranged
by
the
time
laurie
returned
with
a
note
from
aunt
march
enclosing
the
desired
sum
and
a
few
lines
repeating
what
she
had
often
said
before,--that
she
had
always
told
them
it
was
absurd
for
march
to
go
into
the
army
always
predicted
that
no
good
would
come
of
it
and
she
hoped
they
would
take
her
advice
next
time
mrs
march
put
the
note
in
the
fire
the
money
in
her
purse
and
went
on
with
her
preparations
with
her
lips
folded
tightly
in
a
way
which
jo
would
have
understood
if
she
had
been
there
the
short
afternoon
wore
away
all
the
other
errands
were
done
and
meg
and
her
mother
busy
at
some
necessary
needle-work
while
beth
and
amy
got
tea
and
hannah
finished
her
ironing
with
what
she
called
a
slap
and
a
bang
but
still
jo
did
not
come
they
began
to
get
anxious
and
laurie
went
off
to
find
her
for
no
one
ever
knew
what
freak
jo
might
take
into
her
head
he
missed
her
however
and
she
came
walking
in
with
a
very
queer
expression
of
countenance
for
there
was
a
mixture
of
fun
and
fear
satisfaction
and
regret
in
it
which
puzzled
the
family
as
much
as
did
the
roll
of
bills
she
laid
before
her
mother
saying
with
a
little
choke
in
her
voice
that's
my
contribution
towards
making
father
comfortable
and
bringing
him
home
my
dear
where
did
you
get
it
twenty-five
dollars
jo
i
hope
you
haven't
done
anything
rash
no
it's
mine
honestly
i
didn't
beg
borrow
or
steal
it
i
earned
it
and
i
don't
think
you'll
blame
me
for
i
only
sold
what
was
my
own
as
she
spoke
jo
took
off
her
bonnet
and
a
general
outcry
arose
for
all
her
abundant
hair
was
cut
short
your
hair
your
beautiful
hair
o
jo
how
could
you
your
one
beauty
my
dear
girl
there
was
no
need
of
this
she
doesn't
look
like
my
jo
any
more
but
i
love
her
dearly
for
it
as
every
one
exclaimed
and
beth
hugged
the
cropped
head
tenderly
jo
assumed
an
indifferent
air
which
did
not
deceive
any
one
a
particle
and
said
rumpling
up
the
brown
bush
and
trying
to
look
as
if
she
liked
it
it
doesn't
affect
the
fate
of
the
nation
so
don't
wail
beth
it
will
be
good
for
my
vanity
i
was
getting
too
proud
of
my
wig
it
will
do
my
brains
good
to
have
that
mop
taken
off
my
head
feels
deliciously
light
and
cool
and
the
barber
said
i
could
soon
have
a
curly
crop
which
will
be
boyish
becoming
and
easy
to
keep
in
order
i'm
satisfied
so
please
take
the
money
and
let's
have
supper
tell
me
all
about
it
jo
_i_
am
not
quite
satisfied
but
i
can't
blame
you
for
i
know
how
willingly
you
sacrificed
your
vanity
as
you
call
it
to
your
love
but
my
dear
it
was
not
necessary
and
i'm
afraid
you
will
regret
it
one
of
these
days
said
mrs
march
no
i
won't
returned
jo
stoutly
feeling
much
relieved
that
her
prank
was
not
entirely
condemned
what
made
you
do
it
asked
amy
who
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
cutting
off
her
head
as
her
pretty
hair
well
i
was
wild
to
do
something
for
father
replied
jo
as
they
gathered
about
the
table
for
healthy
young
people
can
eat
even
in
the
midst
of
trouble
i
hate
to
borrow
as
much
as
mother
does
and
i
knew
aunt
march
would
croak
she
always
does
if
you
ask
for
a
ninepence
meg
gave
all
her
quarterly
salary
toward
the
rent
and
i
only
got
some
clothes
with
mine
so
i
felt
wicked
and
was
bound
to
have
some
money
if
i
sold
the
nose
off
my
face
to
get
it
you
needn't
feel
wicked
my
child
you
had
no
winter
things
and
got
the
simplest
with
your
own
hard
earnings
said
mrs
march
with
a
look
that
warmed
jo's
heart
i
hadn't
the
least
idea
of
selling
my
hair
at
first
but
as
i
went
along
i
kept
thinking
what
i
could
do
and
feeling
as
if
i'd
like
to
dive
into
some
of
the
rich
stores
and
help
myself
in
a
barber's
window
i
saw
tails
of
hair
with
the
prices
marked
and
one
black
tail
not
so
thick
as
mine
was
forty
dollars
it
came
over
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
i
had
one
thing
to
make
money
out
of
and
without
stopping
to
think
i
walked
in
asked
if
they
bought
hair
and
what
they
would
give
for
mine
i
don't
see
how
you
dared
to
do
it
said
beth
in
a
tone
of
awe
oh
he
was
a
little
man
who
looked
as
if
he
merely
lived
to
oil
his
hair
he
rather
stared
at
first
as
if
he
wasn't
used
to
having
girls
bounce
into
his
shop
and
ask
him
to
buy
their
hair
he
said
he
didn't
care
about
mine
it
wasn't
the
fashionable
color
and
he
never
paid
much
for
it
in
the
first
place
the
work
put
into
it
made
it
dear
and
so
on
it
was
getting
late
and
i
was
afraid
if
it
wasn't
done
right
away
that
i
shouldn't
have
it
done
at
all
and
you
know
when
i
start
to
do
a
thing
i
hate
to
give
it
up
so
i
begged
him
to
take
it
and
told
him
why
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
it
was
silly
i
dare
say
but
it
changed
his
mind
for
i
got
rather
excited
and
told
the
story
in
my
topsy-turvy
way
and
his
wife
heard
and
said
so
kindly,--
'take
it
thomas
and
oblige
the
young
lady
i'd
do
as
much
for
our
jimmy
any
day
if
i
had
a
spire
of
hair
worth
selling.'
who
was
jimmy
asked
amy
who
liked
to
have
things
explained
as
they
went
along
her
son
she
said
who
was
in
the
army
how
friendly
such
things
make
strangers
feel
don't
they
she
talked
away
all
the
time
the
man
clipped
and
diverted
my
mind
nicely
illustration
the
man
clipped
didn't
you
feel
dreadfully
when
the
first
cut
came
asked
meg
with
a
shiver
i
took
a
last
look
at
my
hair
while
the
man
got
his
things
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
i
never
snivel
over
trifles
like
that
i
will
confess
though
i
felt
queer
when
i
saw
the
dear
old
hair
laid
out
on
the
table
and
felt
only
the
short
rough
ends
on
my
head
it
almost
seemed
as
if
i'd
an
arm
or
a
leg
off
the
woman
saw
me
look
at
it
and
picked
out
a
long
lock
for
me
to
keep
i'll
give
it
to
you
marmee
just
to
remember
past
glories
by
for
a
crop
is
so
comfortable
i
don't
think
i
shall
ever
have
a
mane
again
mrs
march
folded
the
wavy
chestnut
lock
and
laid
it
away
with
a
short
gray
one
in
her
desk
she
only
said
thank
you
deary
but
something
in
her
face
made
the
girls
change
the
subject
and
talk
as
cheerfully
as
they
could
about
mr
brooke's
kindness
the
prospect
of
a
fine
day
to-morrow
and
the
happy
times
they
would
have
when
father
came
home
to
be
nursed
no
one
wanted
to
go
to
bed
when
at
ten
o'clock
mrs
march
put
by
the
last
finished
job
and
said
come
girls
beth
went
to
the
piano
and
played
the
father's
favorite
hymn
all
began
bravely
but
broke
down
one
by
one
till
beth
was
left
alone
singing
with
all
her
heart
for
to
her
music
was
always
a
sweet
consoler
go
to
bed
and
don't
talk
for
we
must
be
up
early
and
shall
need
all
the
sleep
we
can
get
good-night
my
darlings
said
mrs
march
as
the
hymn
ended
for
no
one
cared
to
try
another
they
kissed
her
quietly
and
went
to
bed
as
silently
as
if
the
dear
invalid
lay
in
the
next
room
beth
and
amy
soon
fell
asleep
in
spite
of
the
great
trouble
but
meg
lay
awake
thinking
the
most
serious
thoughts
she
had
ever
known
in
her
short
life
jo
lay
motionless
and
her
sister
fancied
that
she
was
asleep
till
a
stifled
sob
made
her
exclaim
as
she
touched
a
wet
cheek,--
jo
dear
what
is
it
are
you
crying
about
father
no
not
now
what
then
my--my
hair
burst
out
poor
jo
trying
vainly
to
smother
her
emotion
in
the
pillow
it
did
not
sound
at
all
comical
to
meg
who
kissed
and
caressed
the
afflicted
heroine
in
the
tenderest
manner
i'm
not
sorry
protested
jo
with
a
choke
i'd
do
it
again
to-morrow
if
i
could
it's
only
the
vain
selfish
part
of
me
that
goes
and
cries
in
this
silly
way
don't
tell
any
one
it's
all
over
now
i
thought
you
were
asleep
so
i
just
made
a
little
private
moan
for
my
one
beauty
how
came
you
to
be
awake
i
can't
sleep
i'm
so
anxious
said
meg
think
about
something
pleasant
and
you'll
soon
drop
off
i
tried
it
but
felt
wider
awake
than
ever
what
did
you
think
of
handsome
faces,--eyes
particularly
answered
meg
smiling
to
herself
in
the
dark
what
color
do
you
like
best
brown--that
is
sometimes
blue
are
lovely
jo
laughed
and
meg
sharply
ordered
her
not
to
talk
then
amiably
promised
to
make
her
hair
curl
and
fell
asleep
to
dream
of
living
in
her
castle
in
the
air
the
clocks
were
striking
midnight
and
the
rooms
were
very
still
as
a
figure
glided
quietly
from
bed
to
bed
smoothing
a
coverlid
here
settling
a
pillow
there
and
pausing
to
look
long
and
tenderly
at
each
unconscious
face
to
kiss
each
with
lips
that
mutely
blessed
and
to
pray
the
fervent
prayers
which
only
mothers
utter
as
she
lifted
the
curtain
to
look
out
into
the
dreary
night
the
moon
broke
suddenly
from
behind
the
clouds
and
shone
upon
her
like
a
bright
benignant
face
which
seemed
to
whisper
in
the
silence
be
comforted
dear
soul
there
is
always
light
behind
the

in
the
cold
gray
dawn
the
sisters
lit
their
lamp
and
read
their
chapter
with
an
earnestness
never
felt
before
for
now
the
shadow
of
a
real
trouble
had
come
the
little
books
were
full
of
help

comfort

as
they
dressed
they
agreed

say
good-by

hopefully
and
send
their
mother
on
her
anxious
journey
unsaddened

looked
unnatural
as
she
flew
about
her
kitchen
with
her
night-cap
on
the
big
trunk
stood
ready
in
the
hall
mother's
cloak
and
bonnet
lay
on
the
sofa
and
mother
herself
sat
trying
to
eat
but
looking
so
pale
and
worn
with
sleeplessness
and
anxiety
that
the
girls
found
it
very
hard
to
keep
their
resolution
meg's
eyes
kept
filling
in
spite
of
herself
jo
was
obliged
to
hide
her
face
in
the
kitchen
roller
more
than
once
and
the
little
girls'
wore
a
grave
troubled
expression
as
if
sorrow
was
a
new
experience
to
them
nobody
talked
much
but
as
the
time
drew
very
near
and
they
sat
waiting
for
the
carriage
mrs
march
said
to
the
girls
who
were
all
busied
about
her
one
folding
her
shawl
another
smoothing
out
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
a
third
putting
on
her
overshoes
and
a
fourth
fastening
up
her
travelling
bag,--

fears
for

yet
i
am
anxious
that
you
should
take
this
trouble
rightly
don't
grieve
and
fret
when
i
am
gone
or
think
that
you
can
comfort
yourselves
by
being
idle
and
trying
to
forget
go
on
with
your
work
as
usual
for
work
is
a
blessed
solace

and

any

brave
girl
ready

little
home
duties
and
you
amy
help
all
you
can
be
obedient
and
keep
happy
safe
at
home
we
will
mother
we
will
the
rattle
of
an
approaching
carriage
made
them
all
start
and
listen
that
was
the
hard
minute
but
the
girls
stood
it
well
no
one
cried
no
one
ran
away
or
uttered
a
lamentation
though
their
hearts
were
very
heavy
as
they
sent
loving
messages
to
father
remembering
as
they
spoke
that
it
might
be
too
late
to
deliver
them
they
kissed
their
mother
quietly
clung
about
her
tenderly
and
tried
to
wave
their
hands
cheerfully
when
she
drove
away
laurie
and
his
grandfather
came
over
to
see
her
off
and
mr
brooke
looked
so
strong
and
sensible
and
kind
that
the
girls
christened
him
mr
greatheart
on
the
spot
good-by
my
darlings
god
bless
and
keep
us
all
whispered
mrs
march
as
she
kissed
one
dear
little
face
after
the
other
and
hurried
into
the
carriage
as
she
rolled
away
the
sun
came
out
and
looking
back
she
saw
it
shining
on
the
group
at
the
gate
like
a
good
omen
they
saw
it
also
and
smiled
and
waved
their
hands
and
the
last
thing
she
beheld
as
she
turned
the
corner
was
the
four
bright
faces
and
behind
them
like
a
body-guard
old
mr
laurence
faithful
hannah
and
devoted
laurie
illustration
she
rolled
away
how
kind
every
one
is
to
us
she
said
turning
to
find
fresh
proof
of
it
in
the
respectful
sympathy
of
the
young
man's
face
i
don't
see
how
they
can
help
it
returned
mr
brooke
laughing
so
infectiously
that
mrs
march
could
not
help
smiling
and
so
the
long
journey
began
with
the
good
omens
of
sunshine
smiles
and
cheerful
words
i
feel
as
if
there
had
been
an
earthquake
said
jo
as
their
neighbors
went
home
to
breakfast
leaving
them
to
rest
and
refresh
themselves
it
seems
as
if
half
the
house
was
gone
added
meg
forlornly
beth
opened
her
lips
to
say
something
but
could
only
point
to
the
pile
of
nicely-mended
hose
which
lay
on
mother's
table
showing
that
even
in
her
last
hurried
moments
she
had
thought
and
worked
for
them
it
was
a
little
thing
but
it
went
straight
to
their
hearts
and
in
spite
of
their
brave
resolutions
they
all
broke
down
and
cried
bitterly
hannah
wisely
allowed
them
to
relieve
their
feelings
and
when
the
shower
showed
signs
of
clearing
up
she
came
to
the
rescue
armed
with
a
coffee-pot
now
my
dear
young
ladies
remember
what
your
ma
said
and
don't
fret
come
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
all
round
and
then
let's
fall
to
work
and
be
a
credit
to
the
family
coffee
was
a
treat
and
hannah
showed
great
tact
in
making
it
that
morning
no
one
could
resist
her
persuasive
nods
or
the
fragrant
invitation
issuing
from
the
nose
of
the
coffee-pot
they
drew
up
to
the
table
exchanged
their
handkerchiefs
for
napkins
and
in
ten
minutes
were
all
right
again
'hope
and
keep
busy;'
that's
the
motto
for
us
so
let's
see
who
will
remember
it
best
i
shall
go
to
aunt
march
as
usual
oh
won't
she
lecture
though
said
jo
as
she
sipped
with
returning
spirit
i
shall
go
to
my
kings
though
i'd
much
rather
stay
at
home
and
attend
to
things
here
said
meg
wishing
she
hadn't
made
her
eyes
so
red
no
need
of
that
beth
and
i
can
keep
house
perfectly
well
put
in
amy
with
an
important
air
hannah
will
tell
us
what
to
do
and
we'll
have
everything
nice
when
you
come
home
added
beth
getting
out
her
mop
and
dish-tub
without
delay
i
think
anxiety
is
very
interesting
observed
amy
eating
sugar
pensively
the
girls
couldn't
help
laughing
and
felt
better
for
it
though
meg
shook
her
head
at
the
young
lady
who
could
find
consolation
in
a
sugar-bowl
the
sight
of
the
turn-overs
made
jo
sober
again
and
when
the
two
went
out
to
their
daily
tasks
they
looked
sorrowfully
back
at
the
window
where
they
were
accustomed
to
see
their
mother's
face
it
was
gone
but
beth
had
remembered
the
little
household
ceremony
and
there
she
was
nodding
away
at
them
like
a
rosy-faced
mandarin
that's
so
like
my
beth
said
jo
waving
her
hat
with
a
grateful
face
good-by
meggy
i
hope
the
kings
won't
train
to-day
don't
fret
about
father
dear
she
added
as
they
parted
and
i
hope
aunt
march
won't
croak
your
hair
_is_
becoming
and
it
looks
very
boyish
and
nice
returned
meg
trying
not
to
smile
at
the
curly
head
which
looked
comically
small
on
her
tall
sister's
shoulders
that's
my
only
comfort
and
touching
her
hat
_à
la_
laurie
away
went
jo
feeling
like
a
shorn
sheep
on
a
wintry
day
news
from
their
father
comforted
the
girls
very
much
for
though
dangerously
ill
the
presence
of
the
best
and
tenderest
of
nurses
had
already
done
him
good
mr
brooke
sent
a
bulletin
every
day
and
as
the
head
of
the
family
meg
insisted
on
reading
the
despatches
which
grew
more
and
more
cheering
as
the
week
passed
at
first
every
one
was
eager
to
write
and
plump
envelopes
were
carefully
poked
into
the
letter-box
by
one
or
other
of
the
sisters
who
felt
rather
important
with
their
washington
correspondence
as
one
of
these
packets
contained
characteristic
notes
from
the
party
we
will
rob
an
imaginary
mail
and
read
them:--
my
dearest
mother,--
it
is
impossible
to
tell
you
how
happy
your
last
letter
made
us
for
the
news
was
so
good
we
couldn't
help
laughing
and
crying
over
it
how
very
kind
mr
brooke
is
and
how
fortunate
that
mr
laurence's
business
detains
him
near
you
so
long
since
he
is
so
useful
to
you
and
father
the
girls
are
all
as
good
as
gold
jo
helps
me
with
the
sewing
and
insists
on
doing
all
sorts
of
hard
jobs
i
should
be
afraid
she
might
overdo
if
i
didn't
know
that
her
'moral
fit'
wouldn't
last
long
beth
is
as
regular
about
her
tasks
as
a
clock
and
never
forgets
what
you
told
her
she
grieves
about
father
and
looks
sober
except
when
she
is
at
her
little
piano
amy
minds
me
nicely
and
i
take
great
care
of
her
she
does
her
own
hair
and
i
am
teaching
her
to
make
button-holes
and
mend
her
stockings
she
tries
very
hard
and
i
know
you
will
be
pleased
with
her
improvement
when
you
come
mr
laurence
watches
over
us
like
a
motherly
old
hen
as
jo
says
and
laurie
is
very
kind
and
neighborly
he
and
jo
keep
us
merry
for
we
get
pretty
blue
sometimes
and
feel
like
orphans
with
you
so
far
away
hannah
is
a
perfect
saint
she
does
not
scold
at
all
and
always
calls
me
miss
'margaret,'
which
is
quite
proper
you
know
and
treats
me
with
respect
we
are
all
well
and
busy
but
we
long
day
and
night
to
have
you
back
give
my
dearest
love
to
father
and
believe
me
ever
your
own
meg
this
note
prettily
written
on
scented
paper
was
a
great
contrast
to
the
next
which
was
scribbled
on
a
big
sheet
of
thin
foreign
paper
ornamented
with
blots
and
all
manner
of
flourishes
and
curly-tailed
letters:--
my
precious
marmee,--
three
cheers
for
dear
father
brooke
was
a
trump
to
telegraph
right
off
and
let
us
know
the
minute
he
was
better
i
rushed
up
garret
when
the
letter
came
and
tried
to
thank
god
for
being
so
good
to
us
but
i
could
only
cry
and
say
'i'm
glad
i'm
glad!'
didn't
that
do
as
well
as
a
regular
prayer
for
i
felt
a
great
many
in
my
heart
we
have
such
funny
times
and
now
i
can
enjoy
them
for
every
one
is
so
desperately
good
it's
like
living
in
a
nest
of
turtle-doves
you'd
laugh
to
see
meg
head
the
table
and
try
to
be
motherish
she
gets
prettier
every
day
and
i'm
in
love
with
her
sometimes
the
children
are
regular
archangels
and
i--well
i'm
jo
and
never
shall
be
anything
else
oh
i
must
tell
you
that
i
came
near
having
a
quarrel
with
laurie
i
freed
my
mind
about
a
silly
little
thing
and
he
was
offended
i
was
right
but
didn't
speak
as
i
ought
and
he
marched
home
saying
he
wouldn't
come
again
till
i
begged
pardon
i
declared
i
wouldn't
and
got
mad
it
lasted
all
day
i
felt
bad
and
wanted
you
very
much
laurie
and
i
are
both
so
proud
it's
hard
to
beg
pardon
but
i
thought
he'd
come
to
it
for
i
_was_
in
the
right
he
didn't
come
and
just
at
night
i
remembered
what
you
said
when
amy
fell
into
the
river
i
read
my
little
book
felt
better
resolved
not
to
let
the
sun
set
on
_my_
anger
and
ran
over
to
tell
laurie
i
was
sorry
i
met
him
at
the
gate
coming
for
the
same
thing
we
both
laughed
begged
each
other's
pardon
and
felt
all
good
and
comfortable
again
i
made
a
'pome'
yesterday
when
i
was
helping
hannah
wash
and
as
father
likes
my
silly
little
things
i
put
it
in
to
amuse
him
give
him
the
lovingest
hug
that
ever
was
and
kiss
yourself
a
dozen
times
for
your
topsy-turvy
jo
a
song
from
the
suds
queen
of
my
tub
i
merrily
sing
while
the
white
foam
rises
high
and
sturdily
wash
and
rinse
and
wring
and
fasten
the
clothes
to
dry
then
out
in
the
free
fresh
air
they
swing
under
the
sunny
sky
i
wish
we
could
wash
from
our
hearts
and
souls
the
stains
of
the
week
away
and
let
water
and
air
by
their
magic
make
ourselves
as
pure
as
they
then
on
the
earth
there
would
be
indeed
a
glorious
washing-day
along
the
path
of
a
useful
life
will
heart's-ease
ever
bloom
the
busy
mind
has
no
time
to
think
of
sorrow
or
care
or
gloom
and
anxious
thoughts
may
be
swept
away
as
we
bravely
wield
a
broom
i
am
glad
a
task
to
me
is
given
to
labor
at
day
by
day
for
it
brings
me
health
and
strength
and
hope
and
i
cheerfully
learn
to
say,--
'head
you
may
think
heart
you
may
feel
but
hand
you
shall
work
alway!'
dear
mother,--
there
is
only
room
for
me
to
send
my
love
and
some
pressed
pansies
from
the
root
i
have
been
keeping
safe
in
the
house
for
father
to
see
i
read
every
morning
try
to
be
good
all
day
and
sing
myself
to
sleep
with
father's
tune
i
can't
sing
'land
of
the
leal'
now
it
makes
me
cry
every
one
is
very
kind
and
we
are
as
happy
as
we
can
be
without
you
amy

little
faithful
for
a
week
the
amount
of
virtue
in
the
old
house
would
have
supplied
the
neighborhood
it
was
really
amazing
for
every
one
seemed
in
a
heavenly
frame
of
mind
and
self-denial
was
all
the
fashion
relieved
of
their
first
anxiety
about
their
father
the
girls
insensibly
relaxed
their
praiseworthy
efforts
a
little
and
began
to
fall
back
into
the
old
ways
they
did
not
forget
their
motto
but
hoping
and
keeping
busy
seemed
to
grow
easier
and
after
such
tremendous
exertions
they
felt
that
endeavor
deserved
a
holiday
and
gave
it
a
good
many
jo
caught
a
bad
cold
through
neglect
to
cover
the
shorn
head
enough
and
was
ordered
to
stay
at
home
till
she
was
better
for
aunt
march
didn't
like
to
hear
people
read
with
colds
in
their
heads
jo
liked
this
and
after
an
energetic
rummage
from
garret
to
cellar
subsided
on
the
sofa
to
nurse
her
cold
with
arsenicum
and
books
amy
found
that
housework
and
art
did
not
go
well
together
and
returned
to
her
mud
pies
meg
went
daily
to
her
pupils
and
sewed
or
thought
she
did
at
home
but
much
time
was
spent
in
writing
long
letters
to
her
mother
or
reading
the
washington
despatches
over
and
over
beth
kept
on
with
only
slight
relapses
into
idleness
or
grieving
all
the
little
duties
were
faithfully
done
each
day
and
many
of
her
sisters'
also
for
they
were
forgetful
and
the
house
seemed
like
a
clock
whose
pendulum
was
gone
a-visiting
when
her
heart
got
heavy
with
longings
for
mother
or
fears
for
father
she
went
away
into
a
certain
closet
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
a
certain
dear
old
gown
and
made
her
little
moan
and
prayed
her
little
prayer
quietly
by
herself
nobody
knew
what
cheered
her
up
after
a
sober
fit
but
every
one
felt
how
sweet
and
helpful
beth
was
and
fell
into
a
way
of
going
to
her
for
comfort
or
advice
in
their
small
affairs
all
were
unconscious
that
this
experience
was
a
test
of
character
and
when
the
first
excitement
was
over
felt
that
they
had
done
well
and
deserved
praise
so
they
did
but
their
mistake
was
in
ceasing
to
do
well
and
they
learned
this
lesson
through
much
anxiety
and
regret
meg
i
wish
you'd
go
and
see
the
hummels
you
know
mother
told
us
not
to
forget
them
said
beth
ten
days
after
mrs
march's
departure
i'm
too
tired
to
go
this
afternoon
replied
meg
rocking
comfortably
as
she
sewed
can't
you
jo
asked
beth
too
stormy
for
me
with
my
cold
i
thought
it
was
almost
well
it's
well
enough
for
me
to
go
out
with
laurie
but
not
well
enough
to
go
to
the
hummels'
said
jo
laughing
but
looking
a
little
ashamed
of
her
inconsistency
why
don't
you
go
yourself
asked
meg
i
_have_
been
every
day
but
the
baby
is
sick
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do
for
it
mrs
hummel
goes
away
to
work
and
lottchen
takes
care
of
it
but
it
gets
sicker
and
sicker
and
i
think
you
or
hannah
ought
to
go
beth
spoke
earnestly
and
meg
promised
she
would
go
to-morrow
ask
hannah
for
some
nice
little
mess
and
take
it
round
beth
the
air
will
do
you
good
said
jo
adding
apologetically
i'd
go
but
i
want
to
finish
my
writing
my
head
aches
and
i'm
tired
so
i
thought
may
be
some
of
you
would
go
said
beth
amy
will
be
in
presently
and
she
will
run
down
for
us
suggested
meg
well
i'll
rest
a
little
and
wait
for
her
so
beth
lay
down
on
the
sofa
the
others
returned
to
their
work
and
the
hummels
were
forgotten
an
hour
passed
amy
did
not
come
meg
went
to
her
room
to
try
on
a
new
dress
jo
was
absorbed
in
her
story
and
hannah
was
sound
asleep
before
the
kitchen
fire
when
beth
quietly
put
on
her
hood
filled
her
basket
with
odds
and
ends
for
the
poor
children
and
went
out
into
the
chilly
air
with
a
heavy
head
and
a
grieved
look
in
her
patient
eyes
it
was
late
when
she
came
back
and
no
one
saw
her
creep
upstairs
and
shut
herself
into
her
mother's
room
half
an
hour
after
jo
went
to
mother's
closet
for
something
and
there
found
beth
sitting
on
the
medicine
chest
looking
very
grave
with
red
eyes
and
a
camphor-bottle
in
her
hand
christopher
columbus
what's
the
matter
cried
jo
as
beth
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
warn
her
off
and
asked
quickly,--
you've
had
the
scarlet
fever
haven't
you
years
ago
when
meg
did
why
then
i'll
tell
you
oh
jo
the
baby's
dead
what
baby
mrs
hummel's
it
died
in
my
lap
before
she
got
home
cried
beth
with
a
sob
my
poor
dear
how
dreadful
for
you
i
ought
to
have
gone
said
jo
taking
her
sister
in
her
arms
as
she
sat
down
in
her
mother's
big
chair
with
a
remorseful
face
it
wasn't
dreadful
jo
only
so
sad
i
saw
in
a
minute
that
it
was
sicker
but
lottchen
said
her
mother
had
gone
for
a
doctor
so
i
took
baby
and
let
lotty
rest
it
seemed
asleep
but
all
of
a
sudden
it
gave
a
little
cry
and
trembled
and
then
lay
very
still
i
tried
to
warm
its
feet
and
lotty
gave
it
some
milk
but
it
didn't
stir
and
i
knew
it
was
dead
illustration
it
didn't
stir
and
i
knew
it
was
dead
don't
cry
dear
what
did
you
do
i
just
sat
and
held
it
softly
till
mrs
hummel
came
with
the
doctor
he
said
it
was
dead
and
looked
at
heinrich
and
minna
who
have
got
sore
throats
'scarlet
fever
ma'am
ought
to
have
called
me
before,'
he
said
crossly
mrs
hummel
told
him
she
was
poor
and
had
tried
to
cure
baby
herself
but
now
it
was
too
late
and
she
could
only
ask
him
to
help
the
others
and
trust
to
charity
for
his
pay
he
smiled
then
and
was
kinder
but
it
was
very
sad
and
i
cried
with
them
till
he
turned
round
all
of
a
sudden
and
told
me
to
go
home
and
take
belladonna
right
away
or
i'd
have
the
fever
no
you
won't
cried
jo
hugging
her
close
with
a
frightened
look
o
beth
if
you
should
be
sick
i
never
could
forgive
myself
what
_shall_
we
do
don't
be
frightened
i
guess
i
shan't
have
it
badly
i
looked
in
mother's
book
and
saw
that
it
begins
with
headache
sore
throat
and
queer
feelings
like
mine
so
i
did
take
some
belladonna
and
i
feel
better
said
beth
laying
her
cold
hands
on
her
hot
forehead
and
trying
to
look
well
if
mother
was
only
at
home
exclaimed
jo
seizing
the
book
and
feeling
that
washington
was
an
immense
way
off
she
read
a
page
looked
at
beth
felt
her
head
peeped
into
her
throat
and
then
said
gravely
you've
been
over
the
baby
every
day
for
more
than
a
week
and
among
the
others
who
are
going
to
have
it
so
i'm
afraid
_you_
are
going
to
have
it
beth
i'll
call
hannah
she
knows
all
about
sickness
don't
let
amy
come
she
never
had
it
and
i
should
hate
to
give
it
to
her
can't
you
and
meg
have
it
over
again
asked
beth
anxiously
i
guess
not
don't
care
if
i
do
serve
me
right
selfish
pig
to
let
you
go
and
stay
writing
rubbish
myself
muttered
jo
as
she
went
to
consult
hannah
the
good
soul
was
wide
awake
in
a
minute
and
took
the
lead
at
once
assuring
jo
that
there
was
no
need
to
worry
every
one
had
scarlet
fever
and
if
rightly
treated
nobody
died,--all
of
which
jo
believed
and
felt
much
relieved
as
they
went
up
to
call
meg
now
i'll
tell
you
what
we'll
do
said
hannah
when
she
had
examined
and
questioned
beth
we
will
have
dr
bangs
just
to
take
a
look
at
you
dear
and
see
that
we
start
right
then
we'll
send
amy
off
to
aunt
march's
for
a
spell
to
keep
her
out
of
harm's
way
and
one
of
you
girls
can
stay
at
home
and
amuse
beth
for
a
day
or
two
i
shall
stay
of
course
i'm
oldest
began
meg
looking
anxious
and
self-reproachful
_i_
shall
because
it's
my
fault
she
is
sick
i
told
mother
i'd
do
the
errands
and
i
haven't
said
jo
decidedly
which
will
you
have
beth
there
ain't
no
need
of
but
one
said
hannah
jo
please
and
beth
leaned
her
head
against
her
sister
with
a
contented
look
which
effectually
settled
that
point
i'll
go
and
tell
amy
said
meg
feeling
a
little
hurt
yet
rather
relieved
on
the
whole
for
she
did
not
like
nursing
and
jo
did
amy
rebelled
outright
and
passionately
declared
that
she
had
rather
have
the
fever
than
go
to
aunt
march
meg
reasoned
pleaded
and
commanded
all
in
vain
amy
protested
that
she
would
_not_
go
and
meg
left
her
in
despair
to
ask
hannah
what
should
be
done
before
she
came
back
laurie
walked
into
the
parlor
to
find
amy
sobbing
with
her
head
in
the
sofa-cushions
she
told
her
story
expecting
to
be
consoled
but
laurie
only
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
walked
about
the
room
whistling
softly
as
he
knit
his
brows
in
deep
thought
presently
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
said
in
his
most
wheedlesome
tone
now
be
a
sensible
little
woman
and
do
as
they
say
no
don't
cry
but
hear
what
a
jolly
plan
i've
got
you
go
to
aunt
march's
and
i'll
come
and
take
you
out
every
day
driving
or
walking
and
we'll
have
capital
times
won't
that
be
better
than
moping
here
illustration
he
sat
down
beside
her
i
don't
wish
to
be
sent
off
as
if
i
was
in
the
way
began
amy
in
an
injured
voice
bless
your
heart
child
it's
to
keep
you
well
you
don't
want
to
be
sick
do
you
no
i'm
sure
i
don't
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
for
i've
been
with
beth
all
the
time
that's
the
very
reason
you
ought
to
go
away
at
once
so
that
you
may
escape
it
change
of
air
and
care
will
keep
you
well
i
dare
say
or
if
it
does
not
entirely
you
will
have
the
fever
more
lightly
i
advise
you
to
be
off
as
soon
as
you
can
for
scarlet
fever
is
no
joke
miss
but
it's
dull
at
aunt
march's
and
she
is
so
cross
said
amy
looking
rather
frightened
it
won't
be
dull
with
me
popping
in
every
day
to
tell
you
how
beth
is
and
take
you
out
gallivanting
the
old
lady
likes
me
and
i'll
be
as
sweet
as
possible
to
her
so
she
won't
peck
at
us
whatever
we
do
will
you
take
me
out
in
the
trotting
wagon
with
puck
on
my
honor
as
a
gentleman
and
come
every
single
day
see
if
i
don't
and
bring
me
back
the
minute
beth
is
well
the
identical
minute
and
go
to
the
theatre
truly
a
dozen
theatres
if
we
may
well--i
guess--i
will
said
amy
slowly
good
girl
call
meg
and
tell
her
you'll
give
in
said
laurie
with
an
approving
pat
which
annoyed
amy
more
than
the
giving
in
meg
and
jo
came
running
down
to
behold
the
miracle
which
had
been
wrought
and
amy
feeling
very
precious
and
self-sacrificing
promised
to
go
if
the
doctor
said
beth
was
going
to
be
ill
how
is
the
little
dear
asked
laurie
for
beth
was
his
especial
pet
and
he
felt
more
anxious
about
her
than
he
liked
to
show
she
is
lying
down
on
mother's
bed
and
feels
better
the
baby's
death
troubled
her
but
i
dare
say
she
has
only
got
cold
hannah
_says_
she
thinks
so
but
she
_looks_
worried
and
that
makes
me
fidgety
answered
meg
what
a
trying
world
it
is
said
jo
rumpling
up
her
hair
in
a
fretful
sort
of
way
no
sooner
do
we
get
out
of
one
trouble
than
down
comes
another
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
anything
to
hold
on
to
when
mother's
gone
so
i'm
all
at
sea
well
don't
make
a
porcupine
of
yourself
it
isn't
becoming
settle
your
wig
jo
and
tell
me
if
i
shall
telegraph
to
your
mother
or
do
anything
asked
laurie
who
never
had
been
reconciled
to
the
loss
of
his
friend's
one
beauty
that
is
what
troubles
me
said
meg
i
think
we
ought
to
tell
her
if
beth
is
really
ill
but
hannah
says
we
mustn't
for
mother
can't
leave
father
and
it
will
only
make
them
anxious
beth
won't
be
sick
long
and
hannah
knows
just
what
to
do
and
mother
said
we
were
to
mind
her
so
i
suppose
we
must
but
it
doesn't
seem
quite
right
to
me
hum
well
i
can't
say
suppose
you
ask
grandfather
after
the
doctor
has
been
we
will
jo
go
and
get
dr
bangs
at
once
commanded
meg
we
can't
decide
anything
till
he
has
been
stay
where
you
are
jo
i'm
errand-boy
to
this
establishment
said
laurie
taking
up
his
cap
i'm
afraid
you
are
busy
began
meg
no
i've
done
my
lessons
for
the
day
do
you
study
in
vacation
time
asked
jo
i
follow
the
good
example
my
neighbors
set
me
was
laurie's
answer
as
he
swung
himself
out
of
the
room
i
have
great
hopes
of
my
boy
observed
jo
watching
him
fly
over
the
fence
with
an
approving
smile
he
does
very
well--for
a
boy
was
meg's
somewhat
ungracious
answer
for
the
subject
did
not
interest
her
dr
bangs
came
said
beth
had
symptoms
of
the
fever
but
thought
she
would
have
it
lightly
though
he
looked
sober
over
the
hummel
story
amy
was
ordered
off
at
once
and
provided
with
something
to
ward
off
danger
she
departed
in
great
state
with
jo
and
laurie
as
escort
aunt
march
received
them
with
her
usual
hospitality
what
do
you
want
now
she
asked
looking
sharply
over
her
spectacles
while
the
parrot
sitting
on
the
back
of
her
chair
called
out,--
illustration
what
do
you
want
now
go
away
no
boys
allowed
here
laurie
retired
to
the
window
and
jo
told
her
story
no
more
than
i
expected
if
you
are
allowed
to
go
poking
about
among
poor
folks
amy
can
stay
and
make
herself
useful
if
she
isn't
sick
which
i've
no
doubt
she
will
be,--looks
like
it
now
don't
cry
child
it
worries
me
to
hear
people
sniff
amy
_was_
on
the
point
of
crying
but
laurie
slyly
pulled
the
parrot's
tail
which
caused
polly
to
utter
an
astonished
croak
and
call
out,--
bless
my
boots
in
such
a
funny
way
that
she
laughed
instead
what
do
you
hear
from
your
mother
asked
the
old
lady
gruffly
father
is
much
better
replied
jo
trying
to
keep
sober
oh

he
well
that
won't
last
long
i
fancy

the
cheerful
reply
ha

never

of

by

squalled
polly
dancing
on
her
perch
and
clawing
at
the
old
lady's
cap
as
laurie
tweaked
him
in
the
rear
hold
your
tongue
you
disrespectful
old
bird
and
jo
you'd
better
go
at
once
it

to

about
so
late
with
a
rattle-pated
boy
like--
hold
your

you
disrespectful
old
bird
cried
polly
tumbling
off
the
chair
with
a
bounce
and
running
to
peck
the
rattle-pated
boy
who
was
shaking
with
laughter
at
the
last
speech

xviii
dark
days
illustration
beth
did
have
the
fever
beth
did
have
the
fever
and
was
much
sicker
than
any
one
but
hannah
and
the
doctor
suspected
the
girls
knew
nothing
about
illness
and
mr
laurence
was
not
allowed
to
see
her
so
hannah
had
everything
all
her
own
way
and
busy
dr
bangs
did
his
best
but
left
a
good
deal
to
the
excellent
nurse
meg
stayed
at
home
lest
she
should
infect
the
kings
and
kept
house
feeling
very
anxious
and
a
little
guilty
when
she
wrote
letters
in
which
no
mention
was
made
of
beth's
illness
she
could
not
think
it
right
to
deceive
her
mother
but
she
had
been
bidden
to
mind
hannah
and
hannah
wouldn't
hear
of
mrs
march
bein'
told
and
worried
just
for
sech
a
trifle
jo
devoted
herself
to
beth
day
and
night
not
a
hard
task
for
beth
was
very
patient
and
bore
her
pain
uncomplainingly
as
long
as
she
could
control
herself
but
there
came
a
time
when
during
the
fever
fits
she
began
to
talk
in
a
hoarse
broken
voice
to
play
on
the
coverlet
as
if
on
her
beloved
little
piano
and
try
to
sing
with
a
throat
so
swollen
that
there
was
no
music
left
a
time
when
she
did
not
know
the
familiar
faces
round
her
but
addressed
them
by
wrong
names
and
called
imploringly
for
her
mother
then
jo
grew
frightened
meg
begged
to
be
allowed
to
write
the
truth
and
even
hannah
said
she
would
think
of
it
though
there
was
no
danger
_yet_
a
letter
from
washington
added
to
their
trouble
for
mr
march
had
had
a
relapse
and
could
not
think
of
coming
home
for
a
long
while
how
dark
the
days
seemed
now
how
sad
and
lonely
the
house
and
how
heavy
were
the
hearts
of
the
sisters
as
they
worked
and
waited
while
the
shadow
of
death
hovered
over
the
once
happy
home
then
it
was
that
margaret
sitting
alone
with
tears
dropping
often
on
her
work
felt
how
rich
she
had
been
in
things
more
precious
than
any
luxuries
money
could
buy,--in
love
protection
peace
and
health
the
real
blessings
of
life
then
it
was
that
jo
living
in
the
darkened
room
with
that
suffering
little
sister
always
before
her
eyes
and
that
pathetic
voice
sounding
in
her
ears
learned
to
see
the
beauty
and
the
sweetness
of
beth's
nature
to
feel
how
deep
and
tender
a
place
she
filled
in
all
hearts
and
to
acknowledge
the
worth
of
beth's
unselfish
ambition
to
live
for
others
and
make
home
happy
by
the
exercise
of
those
simple
virtues
which
all
may
possess
and
which
all
should
love
and
value
more
than
talent
wealth
or
beauty
and
amy
in
her
exile
longed
eagerly
to
be
at
home
that
she
might
work
for
beth
feeling
now
that
no
service
would
be
hard
or
irksome
and
remembering
with
regretful
grief
how
many
neglected
tasks
those
willing
hands
had
done
for
her
laurie
haunted
the
house
like
a
restless
ghost
and
mr
laurence
locked
the
grand
piano
because
he
could
not
bear
to
be
reminded
of
the
young
neighbor
who
used
to
make
the
twilight
pleasant
for
him
every
one
missed
beth
the
milkman
baker
grocer
and
butcher
inquired
how
she
did
poor
mrs
hummel
came
to
beg
pardon
for
her
thoughtlessness
and
to
get
a
shroud
for
minna
the
neighbors
sent
all
sorts
of
comforts
and
good
wishes
and
even
those
who
knew
her
best
were
surprised
to
find
how
many
friends
shy
little
beth
had
made
meanwhile
she
lay
on
her
bed
with
old
joanna
at
her
side
for
even
in
her
wanderings
she
did
not
forget
her
forlorn
_protégé_
she
longed
for
her
cats
but
would
not
have
them
brought
lest
they
should
get
sick
and
in
her
quiet
hours
she
was
full
of
anxiety
about
jo
she
sent
loving
messages
to
amy
bade
them
tell
her
mother
that
she
would
write
soon
and
often
begged
for
pencil
and
paper
to
try
to
say
a
word
that
father
might
not
think
she
had
neglected
him
but
soon
even
these
intervals
of
consciousness
ended
and
she
lay
hour
after
hour
tossing
to
and
fro
with
incoherent
words
on
her
lips
or
sank
into
a
heavy
sleep
which
brought
her
no
refreshment
dr
bangs
came
twice
a
day
hannah
sat
up
at
night
meg
kept
a
telegram
in
her
desk
all
ready
to
send
off
at
any
minute
and
jo
never
stirred
from
beth's
side
the
first
of
december
was
a
wintry
day
indeed
to
them
for
a
bitter
wind
blew
snow
fell
fast
and
the
year
seemed
getting
ready
for
its
death
when
dr
bangs
came
that
morning
he
looked
long
at
beth
held
the
hot
hand
in
both
his
own
a
minute
and
laid
it
gently
down
saying
in
a
low
tone
to
hannah,--
if
mrs
march
_can_
leave
her
husband
she'd
better
be
sent
for
hannah
nodded
without
speaking
for
her
lips
twitched
nervously
meg
dropped
down
into
a
chair
as
the
strength
seemed
to
go
out
of
her
limbs
at
the
sound
of
those
words
and
jo
after
standing
with
a
pale
face
for
a
minute
ran
to
the
parlor
snatched
up
the
telegram
and
throwing
on
her
things
rushed
out
into
the
storm
she
was
soon
back
and
while
noiselessly
taking
off
her
cloak
laurie
came
in
with
a
letter
saying
that
mr
march
was
mending
again
jo
read
it
thankfully
but
the
heavy
weight
did
not
seem
lifted
off
her
heart
and
her
face
was
so
full
of
misery
that
laurie
asked
quickly,--
what
is
it
is
beth
worse
i've
sent
for
mother
said
jo
tugging
at
her
rubber
boots
with
a
tragical
expression
good
for
you
jo
did
you
do
it
on
your
own
responsibility
asked
laurie
as
he
seated
her
in
the
hall
chair
and
took
off
the
rebellious
boots
seeing
how
her
hands
shook
no
the
doctor
told
us
to
o
jo
it's
not
so
bad
as
that
cried
laurie
with
a
startled
face
yes
it
is
she
doesn't
know
us
she
doesn't
even
talk
about
the
flocks
of
green
doves
as
she
calls
the
vine-leaves
on
the
wall
she
doesn't
look
like
my
beth
and
there's
nobody
to
help
us
bear
it
mother
and
father
both
gone
and
god
seems
so
far
away
i
can't
find
him
as
the
tears
streamed
fast
down
poor
jo's
cheeks
she
stretched
out
her
hand
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
as
if
groping
in
the
dark
and
laurie
took
it
in
his
whispering
as
well
as
he
could
with
a
lump
in
his
throat,--
i'm
here
hold
on
to
me
jo
dear
she
could
not
speak
but
she
did
hold
on
and
the
warm
grasp
of
the
friendly
human
hand
comforted
her
sore
heart
and
seemed
to
lead
her
nearer
to
the
divine
arm
which
alone
could
uphold
her
in
her
trouble
laurie
longed
to
say
something
tender
and
comfortable
but
no
fitting
words
came
to
him
so
he
stood
silent
gently
stroking
her
bent
head
as
her
mother
used
to
do
it
was
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
far
more
soothing
than
the
most
eloquent
words
for
jo
felt
the
unspoken
sympathy
and
in
the
silence
learned
the
sweet
solace
which
affection
administers
to
sorrow
soon
she
dried
the
tears
which
had
relieved
her
and
looked
up
with
a
grateful
face
illustration
gently
stroking
her
head
as
her
mother
used
to
do
thank
you
teddy
i'm
better
now
i
don't
feel
so
forlorn
and
will
try
to
bear
it
if
it
comes
keep
hoping
for
the
best
that
will
help
you
jo
soon
your
mother
will
be
here
and
then
everything
will
be
right
i'm
so
glad
father
is
better
now
she
won't
feel
so
bad
about
leaving
him
oh
me
it
does
seem
as
if
all
the
troubles
came
in
a
heap
and
i
got
the
heaviest
part
on
my
shoulders
sighed
jo
spreading
her
wet
handkerchief
over
her
knees
to
dry
doesn't
meg
pull
fair
asked
laurie
looking
indignant
oh
yes
she
tries
to
but
she
can't
love
bethy
as
i
do
and
she
won't
miss
her
as
i
shall
beth
is
my
conscience
and
i
_can't_
give
her
up
i
can't
i
can't
down
went
jo's
face
into
the
wet
handkerchief
and
she
cried
despairingly
for
she
had
kept
up
bravely
till
now
and
never
shed
a
tear
laurie
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
but
could
not
speak
till
he
had
subdued
the
choky
feeling
in
his
throat
and
steadied
his
lips
it
might
be
unmanly
but
he
couldn't
help
it
and
i
am
glad
of
it
presently
as
jo's
sobs
quieted
he
said
hopefully
i
don't
think
she
will
die
she's
so
good
and
we
all
love
her
so
much
i
don't
believe
god
will
take
her
away
yet
the
good
and
dear
people
always
do
die
groaned
jo
but
she
stopped
crying
for
her
friend's
words
cheered
her
up
in
spite
of
her
own
doubts
and
fears
poor
girl
you're
worn
out
it
isn't
like
you
to
be
forlorn
stop
a
bit
i'll
hearten
you
up
in
a
jiffy
laurie
went
off
two
stairs
at
a
time
and
jo
laid
her
wearied
head
down
on
beth's
little
brown
hood
which
no
one
had
thought
of
moving
from
the
table
where
she
left
it
it
must
have
possessed
some
magic
for
the
submissive
spirit
of
its
gentle
owner
seemed
to
enter
into
jo
and
when
laurie
came
running
down
with
a
glass
of
wine
she
took
it
with
a
smile
and
said
bravely
i
drink--health
to
my
beth
you
are
a
good
doctor
teddy
and
_such_
a
comfortable
friend
how
can
i
ever
pay
you
she
added
as
the
wine
refreshed
her
body
as
the
kind
words
had
done
her
troubled
mind
i'll
send
in
my
bill
by
and
by
and
to-night
i'll
give
you
something
that
will
warm
the
cockles
of
your
heart
better
than
quarts
of
wine
said
laurie
beaming
at
her
with
a
face
of
suppressed
satisfaction
at
something
what
is
it
cried
jo
forgetting
her
woes
for
a
minute
in
her
wonder
i
telegraphed
to
your
mother
yesterday
and
brooke
answered
she'd
come
at
once
and
she'll
be
here
to-night
and
everything
will
be
all
right
aren't
you
glad
i
did
it
laurie
spoke
very
fast
and
turned
red
and
excited
all
in
a
minute
for
he
had
kept
his
plot
a
secret
for
fear
of
disappointing
the
girls
or
harming
beth
jo
grew
quite
white
flew
out
of
her
chair
and
the
moment
he
stopped
speaking
she
electrified
him
by
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
crying
out
with
a
joyful
cry
o
laurie
o
mother
i
_am_
so
glad
she
did
not
weep
again
but
laughed
hysterically
and
trembled
and
clung
to
her
friend
as
if
she
was
a
little
bewildered
by
the
sudden
news
laurie
though
decidedly
amazed
behaved
with
great
presence
of
mind
he
patted
her
back
soothingly
and
finding
that
she
was
recovering
followed
it
up
by
a
bashful
kiss
or
two
which
brought
jo
round
at
once
holding
on
to
the
banisters
she
put
him
gently
away
saying
breathlessly
oh
don't
i
didn't
mean
to
it
was
dreadful
of
me
but
you
were
such
a
dear
to
go
and
do
it
in
spite
of
hannah
that
i
couldn't
help
flying
at
you
tell
me
all
about
it
and
don't
give
me
wine
again
it
makes
me
act
so
i
don't
mind
laughed
laurie
as
he
settled
his
tie
why
you
see
i
got
fidgety
and
so
did
grandpa
we
thought
hannah
was
overdoing
the
authority
business
and
your
mother
ought
to
know
she'd
never
forgive
us
if
beth--well
if
anything
happened
you
know
so
i
got
grandpa
to
say
it
was
high
time
we
did
something
and
off
i
pelted
to
the
office
yesterday
for
the
doctor
looked
sober
and
hannah
most
took
my
head
off
when
i
proposed
a
telegram
i
never
_can_
bear
to
be
'lorded
over;'
so
that
settled
my
mind
and
i
did
it
your
mother
will
come
i
know
and
the
late
train
is
in
at
two
a.m
i
shall
go
for
her
and
you've
only
got
to
bottle
up
your
rapture
and
keep
beth
quiet
till
that
blessed
lady
gets
here
laurie
you're
an
angel
how
shall
i
ever
thank
you
fly
at
me
again
i
rather
like
it
said
laurie
looking
mischievous,--a
thing
he
had
not
done
for
a
fortnight
no
thank
you
i'll
do
it
by
proxy
when
your
grandpa
comes
don't
tease
but
go
home
and
rest
for
you'll
be
up
half
the
night
bless
you
teddy
bless
you
jo
had
backed
into
a
corner
and
as
she
finished
her
speech
she
vanished
precipitately
into
the
kitchen
where
she
sat
down
upon
a
dresser
and
told
the
assembled
cats
that
she
was
happy
oh
_so_
happy
while
laurie
departed
feeling
that
he
had
made
rather
a
neat
thing
of
it
that's
the
interferingest
chap
i
ever
see
but
i
forgive
him
and
do
hope
mrs
march
is
coming
on
right
away
said
hannah
with
an
air
of
relief
when
jo
told
the
good
news
meg
had
a
quiet
rapture
and
then
brooded
over
the
letter
while
jo
set
the
sick-room
in
order
and
hannah
knocked
up
a
couple
of
pies
in
case
of
company
unexpected
a
breath
of
fresh
air
seemed
to
blow
through
the
house
and
something
better
than
sunshine
brightened
the
quiet
rooms
everything
appeared
to
feel
the
hopeful
change
beth's
bird
began
to
chirp
again
and
a
half-blown
rose
was
discovered
on
amy's
bush
in
the
window
the
fires
seemed
to
burn
with
unusual
cheeriness
and
every
time
the
girls
met
their
pale
faces
broke
into
smiles
as
they
hugged
one
another
whispering
encouragingly
mother's
coming
dear
mother's
coming
every
one
rejoiced
but
beth
she
lay
in
that
heavy
stupor
alike
unconscious
of
hope
and
joy
doubt
and
danger
it
was
a
piteous
sight,--the
once
rosy
face
so
changed
and
vacant
the
once
busy
hands
so
weak
and
wasted
the
once
smiling
lips
quite
dumb
and
the
once
pretty
well-kept
hair
scattered
rough
and
tangled
on
the
pillow
all
day
she
lay
so
only
rousing
now
and
then
to
mutter
water
with
lips
so
parched
they
could
hardly
shape
the
word
all
day
jo
and
meg
hovered
over
her
watching
waiting
hoping
and
trusting
in
god
and
mother
and
all
day
the
snow
fell
the
bitter
wind
raged
and
the
hours
dragged
slowly
by
but
night
came
at
last
and
every
time
the
clock
struck
the
sisters
still
sitting
on
either
side
the
bed
looked
at
each
other
with
brightening
eyes
for
each
hour
brought
help
nearer
the
doctor
had
been
in
to
say
that
some
change
for
better
or
worse
would
probably
take
place
about
midnight
at
which
time
he
would
return
hannah
quite
worn
out
lay
down
on
the
sofa
at
the
bed's
foot
and
fell
fast
asleep
mr
laurence
marched
to
and
fro
in
the
parlor
feeling
that
he
would
rather
face
a
rebel
battery
than
mrs
march's
anxious
countenance
as
she
entered
laurie
lay
on
the
rug
pretending
to
rest
but
staring
into
the
fire
with
the
thoughtful
look
which
made
his
black
eyes
beautifully
soft
and
clear
the
girls
never
forgot
that
night
for
no
sleep
came
to
them
as
they
kept
their
watch
with
that
dreadful
sense
of
powerlessness
which
comes
to
us
in
hours
like
those
if
god
spares
beth
i
never
will
complain
again
whispered
meg
earnestly
if
god
spares
beth
i'll
try
to
love
and
serve
him
all
my
life
answered
jo
with
equal
fervor
i
wish
i
had
no
heart
it
aches
so
sighed
meg
after
a
pause
if
life
is
often
as
hard
as
this
i
don't
see
how
we
ever
shall
get
through
it
added
her
sister
despondently
here
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
both
forgot
themselves
in
watching
beth
for
they
fancied
a
change
passed
over
her
wan
face
the
house
was
still
as
death
and
nothing
but
the
wailing
of
the
wind
broke
the
deep
hush
weary
hannah
slept
on
and
no
one
but
the
sisters
saw
the
pale
shadow
which
seemed
to
fall
upon
the
little
bed
an
hour
went
by
and
nothing
happened
except
laurie's
quiet
departure
for
the
station
another
hour,--still
no
one
came
and
anxious
fears
of
delay
in
the
storm
or
accidents
by
the
way
or
worst
of
all
a
great
grief
at
washington
haunted
the
poor
girls
it
was
past
two
when
jo
who
stood
at
the
window
thinking
how
dreary
the
world
looked
in
its
winding-sheet
of
snow
heard
a
movement
by
the
bed
and
turning
quickly
saw
meg
kneeling
before
their
mother's
easy-chair
with
her
face
hidden
a
dreadful
fear
passed
coldly
over
jo
as
she
thought
beth
is
dead
and
meg
is
afraid
to
tell
me
she
was
back
at
her
post
in
an
instant
and
to
her
excited
eyes
a
great
change
seemed
to
have
taken
place
the
fever
flush
and
the
look
of
pain
were
gone
and
the
beloved
little
face
looked
so
pale
and
peaceful
in
its
utter
repose
that
jo
felt
no
desire
to
weep
or
to
lament
leaning
low
over
this
dearest
of
her
sisters
she
kissed
the
damp
forehead
with
her
heart
on
her
lips
and
softly
whispered
good-by
my
beth
good-by
as
if
waked
by
the
stir
hannah
started
out
of
her
sleep
hurried
to
the
bed
looked
at
beth
felt
her
hands
listened
at
her
lips
and
then
throwing
her
apron
over
her
head
sat
down
to
rock
to
and
fro
exclaiming
under
her
breath
the
fever's
turned
she's
sleepin'
nat'ral
her
skin's
damp
and
she
breathes
easy
praise
be
given
oh
my
goodness
me
before
the
girls
could
believe
the
happy
truth
the
doctor
came
to
confirm
it
he
was
a
homely
man
but
they
thought
his
face
quite
heavenly
when
he
smiled
and
said
with
a
fatherly
look
at
them
yes
my
dears
i
think
the
little
girl
will
pull
through
this
time
keep
the
house
quiet
let
her
sleep
and
when
she
wakes
give
her--
what
they
were
to
give
neither
heard
for
both
crept
into
the
dark
hall
and
sitting
on
the
stairs
held
each
other
close
rejoicing
with
hearts
too
full
for
words
when
they
went
back
to
be
kissed
and
cuddled
by
faithful
hannah
they
found
beth
lying
as
she
used
to
do
with
her
cheek
pillowed
on
her
hand
the
dreadful
pallor
gone
and
breathing
quietly
as
if
just
fallen
asleep
if
mother
would
only
come
now
said
jo
as
the
winter
night
began
to
wane
see
said
meg
coming
up
with
a
white
half-opened
rose
i
thought
this
would
hardly
be
ready
to
lay
in
beth's
hand
to-morrow
if
she--went
away
from
us
but
it
has
blossomed
in
the
night
and
now
i
mean
to
put
it
in
my
vase
here
so
that
when
the
darling
wakes
the
first
thing
she
sees
will
be
the
little
rose
and
mother's
face
never
had
the
sun
risen
so
beautifully
and
never
had
the
world
seemed
so
lovely
as
it
did
to
the
heavy
eyes
of
meg
and
jo
as
they
looked
out
in
the
early
morning
when
their
long
sad
vigil
was
done
it
looks
like
a
fairy
world
said
meg
smiling
to
herself
as
she
stood
behind
the
curtain
watching
the
dazzling
sight
hark
cried
jo
starting
to
her
feet
yes
there
was
a
sound
of
bells
at
the
door
below
a
cry
from
hannah
and
then
laurie's
voice
saying
in
a
joyful
whisper
girls
she's
come
she's
come

amy's
will
xix
amy's
will
while
these
things
were
happening
at
home
amy
was
having
hard
times
at
aunt
march's
she
felt
her
exile
deeply
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
realized
how
much
she
was
beloved
and
petted
at
home
aunt
march
never
petted
any
one
she
did
not
approve
of
it
but
she
meant
to
be
kind
for
the
well-behaved
little
girl
pleased
her
very
much
and
aunt
march
had
a
soft
place
in
her
old
heart
for
her
nephew's
children
though
she
didn't
think
proper
to
confess
it
she
really
did
her
best
to
make
amy
happy
but
dear
me
what
mistakes
she
made
some
old
people
keep
young
at
heart
in
spite
of
wrinkles
and
gray
hairs
can
sympathize
with
children's
little
cares
and
joys
make
them
feel
at
home
and
can
hide
wise
lessons
under
pleasant
plays
giving
and
receiving
friendship
in
the
sweetest
way
but
aunt
march
had
not
this
gift
and
she
worried
amy
very
much
with
her
rules
and
orders
her
prim
ways
and
long
prosy
talks
finding
the
child
more
docile
and
amiable
than
her
sister
the
old
lady
felt
it
her
duty
to
try
and
counteract
as
far
as
possible
the
bad
effects
of
home
freedom
and
indulgence
so
she
took
amy
in
hand
and
taught
her
as
she
herself
had
been
taught
sixty
years
ago,--a
process
which
carried
dismay
to
amy's
soul
and
made
her
feel
like
a
fly
in
the
web
of
a
very
strict
spider
illustration
polish
up
the
spoons
and
the
fat
silver
teapot
she
had
to
wash
the
cups
every
morning
and
polish
up
the
old-fashioned
spoons
the
fat
silver
teapot
and
the
glasses
till
they
shone
then
she
must
dust
the
room
and
what
a
trying
job
that
was
not
a
speck
escaped
aunt
march's
eye
and
all
the
furniture
had
claw
legs
and
much
carving
which
was
never
dusted
to
suit
then
polly
must
be
fed
the
lap-dog
combed
and
a
dozen
trips
upstairs
and
down
to
get
things
or
deliver
orders
for
the
old
lady
was
very
lame
and
seldom
left
her
big
chair
after
these
tiresome
labors
she
must
do
her
lessons
which
was
a
daily
trial
of
every
virtue
she
possessed
then
she
was
allowed
one
hour
for
exercise
or
play
and
didn't
she
enjoy
it
laurie
came
every
day
and
wheedled
aunt
march
till
amy
was
allowed
to
go
out
with
him
when
they
walked
and
rode
and
had
capital
times
after
dinner
she
had
to
read
aloud
and
sit
still
while
the
old
lady
slept
which
she
usually
did
for
an
hour
as
she
dropped
off
over
the
first
page
then
patchwork
or
towels
appeared
and
amy
sewed
with
outward
meekness
and
inward
rebellion
till
dusk
when
she
was
allowed
to
amuse
herself
as
she
liked
till
tea-time
the
evenings
were
the
worst
of
all
for
aunt
march
fell
to
telling
long
stories
about
her
youth
which
were
so
unutterably
dull
that
amy
was
always
ready
to
go
to
bed
intending
to
cry
over
her
hard
fate
but
usually
going
to
sleep
before
she
had
squeezed
out
more
than
a
tear
or
two
if
it
had
not
been
for
laurie
and
old
esther
the
maid
she
felt
that
she
never
could
have
got
through
that
dreadful
time
the
parrot
alone
was
enough
to
drive
her
distracted
for
he
soon
felt
that
she
did
not
admire
him
and
revenged
himself
by
being
as
mischievous
as
possible
he
pulled
her
hair
whenever
she
came
near
him
upset
his
bread
and
milk
to
plague
her
when
she
had
newly
cleaned
his
cage
made
mop
bark
by
pecking
at
him
while
madam
dozed
called
her
names
before
company
and
behaved
in
all
respects
like
a
reprehensible
old
bird
then
she
could
not
endure
the
dog,--a
fat
cross
beast
who
snarled
and
yelped
at
her
when
she
made
his
toilet
and
who
lay
on
his
back
with
all
his
legs
in
the
air
and
a
most
idiotic
expression
of
countenance
when
he
wanted
something
to
eat
which
was
about
a
dozen
times
a
day
the
cook
was
bad-tempered
the
old
coachman
deaf
and
esther
the
only
one
who
ever
took
any
notice
of
the
young
lady
illustration
on
his
back
with
all
his
legs
in
the
air
esther
was
a
frenchwoman
who
had
lived
with
madame
as
she
called
her
mistress
for
many
years
and
who
rather
tyrannized
over
the
old
lady
who
could
not
get
along
without
her
her
real
name
was
estelle
but
aunt
march
ordered
her
to
change
it
and
she
obeyed
on
condition
that
she
was
never
asked
to
change
her
religion
she
took
a
fancy
to
mademoiselle
and
amused
her
very
much
with
odd
stories
of
her
life
in
france
when
amy
sat
with
her
while
she
got
up
madame's
laces
she
also
allowed
her
to
roam
about
the
great
house
and
examine
the
curious
and
pretty
things
stored
away
in
the
big
wardrobes
and
the
ancient
chests
for
aunt
march
hoarded
like
a
magpie
amy's
chief
delight
was
an
indian
cabinet
full
of
queer
drawers
little
pigeon-holes
and
secret
places
in
which
were
kept
all
sorts
of
ornaments
some
precious
some
merely
curious
all
more
or
less
antique
to
examine
and
arrange
these
things
gave
amy
great
satisfaction
especially
the
jewel-cases
in
which
on
velvet
cushions
reposed
the
ornaments
which
had
adorned
a
belle
forty
years
ago
there
was
the
garnet
set
which
aunt
march
wore
when
she
came
out
the
pearls
her
father
gave
her
on
her
wedding-day
her
lover's
diamonds
the
jet
mourning
rings
and
pins
the
queer
lockets
with
portraits
of
dead
friends
and
weeping
willows
made
of
hair
inside
the
baby
bracelets
her
one
little
daughter
had
worn
uncle
march's
big
watch
with
the
red
seal
so
many
childish
hands
had
played
with
and
in
a
box
all
by
itself
lay
aunt
march's
wedding-ring
too
small
now
for
her
fat
finger
but
put
carefully
away
like
the
most
precious
jewel
of
them
all
illustration
i
should
choose
this
which
would
mademoiselle
choose
if
she
had
her
will
asked
esther
who
always
sat
near
to
watch
over
and
lock
up
the
valuables
i
like
the
diamonds
best
but
there
is
no
necklace
among
them
and
i'm
fond
of
necklaces
they
are
so
becoming
i
should
choose
this
if
i
might
replied
amy
looking
with
great
admiration
at
a
string
of
gold
and
ebony
beads
from
which
hung
a
heavy
cross
of
the
same
i
too
covet
that
but
not
as
a
necklace
ah
no
to
me
it
is
a
rosary
and
as
such
i
should
use
it
like
a
good
catholic
said
esther
eying
the
handsome
thing
wistfully
is
it
meant
to
use
as
you
use
the
string
of
good-smelling
wooden
beads
hanging
over
your
glass
asked
amy
truly
yes
to
pray
with
it
would
be
pleasing
to
the
saints
if
one
used
so
fine
a
rosary
as
this
instead
of
wearing
it
as
a
vain
bijou
you
seem
to
take
a
great
deal
of
comfort
in
your
prayers
esther
and
always
come
down
looking
quiet
and
satisfied
i
wish
i
could
if
mademoiselle
was
a
catholic
she
would
find
true
comfort
but
as
that
is
not
to
be
it
would
be
well
if
you
went
apart
each
day
to
meditate
and
pray
as
did
the
good
mistress
whom
i
served
before
madame
she
had
a
little
chapel
and
in
it
found
solacement
for
much
trouble
would
it
be
right
for
me
to
do
so
too
asked
amy
who
in
her
loneliness
felt
the
need
of
help
of
some
sort
and
found
that
she
was
apt
to
forget
her
little
book
now
that
beth
was
not
there
to
remind
her
of
it
it
would
be
excellent
and
charming
and
i
shall
gladly
arrange
the
little
dressing-room
for
you
if
you
like
it
say
nothing
to
madame
but
when
she
sleeps
go
you
and
sit
alone
a
while
to
think
good
thoughts
and
pray
the
dear
god
to
preserve
your
sister
esther
was
truly
pious
and
quite
sincere
in
her
advice
for
she
had
an
affectionate
heart
and
felt
much
for
the
sisters
in
their
anxiety
amy
liked
the
idea
and
gave
her
leave
to
arrange
the
light
closet
next
her
room
hoping
it
would
do
her
good
i
wish
i
knew
where
all
these
pretty
things
would
go
when
aunt
march
dies
she
said
as
she
slowly
replaced
the
shining
rosary
and
shut
the
jewel-cases
one
by
one
to
you
and
your
sisters
i
know
it
madame
confides
in
me
i
witnessed
her
will
and
it
is
to
be
so
whispered
esther
smiling
how
nice
but
i
wish
she'd
let
us
have
them
now
pro-cras-ti-nation
is
not
agreeable
observed
amy
taking
a
last
look
at
the
diamonds
it
is
too
soon
yet
for
the
young
ladies
to
wear
these
things
the
first
one
who
is
affianced
will
have
the
pearls--madame
has
said
it
and
i
have
a
fancy
that
the
little
turquoise
ring
will
be
given
to
you
when
you
go
for
madame
approves
your
good
behavior
and
charming
manners
do
you
think
so
oh
i'll
be
a
lamb
if
i
can
only
have
that
lovely
ring
it's
ever
so
much
prettier
than
kitty
bryant's
i
do
like
aunt
march
after
all
and
amy
tried
on
the
blue
ring
with
a
delighted
face
and
a
firm
resolve
to
earn
it
from
that
day
she
was
a
model
of
obedience
and
the
old
lady
complacently
admired
the
success
of
her
training
esther
fitted
up
the
closet
with
a
little
table
placed
a
footstool
before
it
and
over
it
a
picture
taken
from
one
of
the
shut-up
rooms
she
thought
it
was
of
no
great
value
but
being
appropriate
she
borrowed
it
well
knowing
that
madame
would
never
know
it
nor
care
if
she
did
it
was
however
a
very
valuable
copy
of
one
of
the
famous
pictures
of
the
world
and
amy's
beauty-loving
eyes
were
never
tired
of
looking
up
at
the
sweet
face
of
the
divine
mother
while
tender
thoughts
of
her
own
were
busy
at
her
heart
on
the
table
she
laid
her
little
testament
and
hymn-book
kept
a
vase
always
full
of
the
best
flowers
laurie
brought
her
and
came
every
day
to
sit
alone
thinking
good
thoughts
and
praying
the
dear
god
to
preserve
her
sister
esther
had
given
her
a
rosary
of
black
beads
with
a
silver
cross
but
amy
hung
it
up
and
did
not
use
it
feeling
doubtful
as
to
its
fitness
for
protestant
prayers
the
little
girl
was
very
sincere
in
all
this
for
being
left
alone
outside
the
safe
home-nest
she
felt
the
need
of
some
kind
hand
to
hold
by
so
sorely
that
she
instinctively
turned
to
the
strong
and
tender
friend
whose
fatherly
love
most
closely
surrounds
his
little
children
she
missed
her
mother's
help
to
understand
and
rule
herself
but
having
been
taught
where
to
look
she
did
her
best
to
find
the
way
and
walk
in
it
confidingly
but
amy
was
a
young
pilgrim
and
just
now
her
burden
seemed
very
heavy
she
tried
to
forget
herself
to
keep
cheerful
and
be
satisfied
with
doing
right
though
no
one
saw
or
praised
her
for
it
in
her
first
effort
at
being
very
very
good
she
decided
to
make
her
will
as
aunt
march
had
done
so
that
if
she
_did_
fall
ill
and
die
her
possessions
might
be
justly
and
generously
divided
it
cost
her
a
pang
even
to
think
of
giving
up
the
little
treasures
which
in
her
eyes
were
as
precious
as
the
old
lady's
jewels
during
one
of
her
play-hours
she
wrote
out
the
important
document
as
well
as
she
could
with
some
help
from
esther
as
to
certain
legal
terms
and
when
the
good-natured
frenchwoman
had
signed
her
name
amy
felt
relieved
and
laid
it
by
to
show
laurie
whom
she
wanted
as
a
second
witness
as
it
was
a
rainy
day
she
went
upstairs
to
amuse
herself
in
one
of
the
large
chambers
and
took
polly
with
her
for
company
in
this
room
there
was
a
wardrobe
full
of
old-fashioned
costumes
with
which
esther
allowed
her
to
play
and
it
was
her
favorite
amusement
to
array
herself
in
the
faded
brocades
and
parade
up
and
down
before
the
long
mirror
making
stately
courtesies
and
sweeping
her
train
about
with
a
rustle
which
delighted
her
ears
so
busy
was
she
on
this
day
that
she
did
not
hear
laurie's
ring
nor
see
his
face
peeping
in
at
her
as
she
gravely
promenaded
to
and
fro
flirting
her
fan
and
tossing
her
head
on
which
she
wore
a
great
pink
turban
contrasting
oddly
with
her
blue
brocade
dress
and
yellow
quilted
petticoat
she
was
obliged
to
walk
carefully
for
she
had
on
high-heeled
shoes
and
as
laurie
told
jo
afterward
it
was
a
comical
sight
to
see
her
mince
along
in
her
gay
suit
with
polly
sidling
and
bridling
just
behind
her
imitating
her
as
well
as
he
could
and
occasionally
stopping
to
laugh
or
exclaim
ain't
we
fine
get
along
you
fright
hold
your
tongue
kiss
me
dear
ha
ha
illustration
gravely
promenaded
to
and
fro
having
with
difficulty
restrained
an
explosion
of
merriment
lest
it
should
offend
her
majesty
laurie
tapped
and
was
graciously
received
sit
down
and
rest
while
i
put
these
things
away
then
i
want
to
consult
you
about
a
very
serious
matter
said
amy
when
she
had
shown
her
splendor
and
driven
polly
into
a
corner
that
bird
is
the
trial
of
my
life
she
continued
removing
the
pink
mountain
from
her
head
while
laurie
seated
himself
astride
of
a
chair
yesterday
when
aunt
was
asleep
and
i
was
trying
to
be
as
still
as
a
mouse
polly
began
to
squall
and
flap
about
in
his
cage
so
i
went
to
let
him
out
and
found
a
big
spider
there
i
poked
it
out
and
it
ran
under
the
bookcase
polly
marched
straight
after
it
stooped
down
and
peeped
under
the
bookcase
saying
in
his
funny
way
with
a
cock
of
his
eye
'come
out
and
take
a
walk
my
dear.'
i
_couldn't_
help
laughing
which
made
poll
swear
and
aunt
woke
up
and
scolded
us
both
did
the
spider
accept
the
old
fellow's
invitation
asked
laurie
yawning
yes
out
it
came
and
away
ran
polly
frightened
to
death
and
scrambled
up
on
aunt's
chair
calling
out
'catch
her
catch
her
catch
her!'
as
i
chased
the
spider
that's
a
lie
oh
lor
cried
the
parrot
pecking
at
laurie's
toes
i'd
wring
your
neck
if
you
were
mine
you
old
torment
cried
laurie
shaking
his
fist
at
the
bird
who
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
gravely
croaked
allyluyer
bless
your
buttons
dear
now
i'm
ready
said
amy
shutting
the
wardrobe
and
taking
a
paper
out
of
her
pocket
i
want
you
to
read
that
please
and
tell
me
if
it
is
legal
and
right
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
do
it
for
life
is
uncertain
and
i
don't
want
any
ill-feeling
over
my
tomb
illustration
amy's
will
laurie
bit
his
lips
and
turning
a
little
from
the
pensive
speaker
read
the
following
document
with
praiseworthy
gravity
considering
the
spelling:--

last
will

amy

valnor
_witnesses_

theodore
laurence
the
last
name
was
written
in
pencil
and
amy
explained
that
he
was
to
rewrite
it
in
ink
and
seal
it
up
for
her
properly
what
put
it
into
your
head
did
any
one
tell
you
about
beth's
giving
away
her
things
asked
laurie
soberly
as
amy
laid
a
bit
of
red
tape
with
sealing-wax
a
taper
and
a
standish
before
him
she
explained
and
then
asked
anxiously
what
about
beth
i'm
sorry
i
spoke
but
as
i
did
i'll
tell
you
she
felt
so
ill
one
day
that
she
told
jo
she
wanted
to
give
her
piano
to
meg
her
cats
to
you
and
the
poor
old
doll
to
jo
who
would
love
it
for
her
sake
she
was
sorry
she
had
so
little
to
give
and
left
locks
of
hair
to
the
rest
of
us
and
her
best
love
to
grandpa
_she_
never
thought
of
a
will
laurie
was
signing
and
sealing
as
he
spoke
and
did
not
look
up
till
a
great
tear
dropped
on
the
paper
amy's
face
was
full
of
trouble
but
she
only
said
don't
people
put
sort
of
postscripts
to
their
wills
sometimes
yes
'codicils,'
they
call
them
put
one
in
mine
then--that
i
wish
_all_
my
curls
cut
off
and
given
round
to
my
friends
i
forgot
it
but
i
want
it
done
though
it
will
spoil
my
looks
laurie
added
it
smiling
at
amy's
last
and
greatest
sacrifice
then
he
amused
her
for
an
hour
and
was
much
interested
in
all
her
trials
but
when
he
came
to
go
amy
held
him
back
to
whisper
with
trembling
lips
is
there
really
any
danger
about
beth
i'm
afraid
there
is
but
we
must
hope
for
the
best
so
don't
cry
dear
and
laurie
put
his
arm
about
her
with
a
brotherly
gesture
which
was
very
comforting
when
he
had
gone
she
went
to
her
little
chapel
and
sitting
in
the
twilight
prayed
for
beth
with
streaming
tears
and
an
aching
heart
feeling
that
a
million
turquoise
rings
would
not
console
her
for
the
loss
of
her
gentle
little
sister

mrs
march
would
not
leave
beth's
side
xx
confidential
i
don't
think
i
have
any
words
in
which
to
tell
the
meeting
of
the
mother
and
daughters
such
hours
are
beautiful
to
live
but
very
hard
to
describe
so
i
will
leave
it
to
the
imagination
of
my
readers
merely
saying
that
the
house
was
full
of
genuine
happiness
and
that
meg's
tender
hope
was
realized
for
when
beth
woke
from
that
long
healing
sleep
the
first
objects
on
which
her
eyes
fell
_were_
the
little
rose
and
mother's
face
too
weak
to
wonder
at
anything
she
only
smiled
and
nestled
close
into
the
loving
arms
about
her
feeling
that
the
hungry
longing
was
satisfied
at
last
then
she
slept
again
and
the
girls
waited
upon
their
mother
for
she
would
not
unclasp
the
thin
hand
which
clung
to
hers
even
in
sleep
hannah
had
dished
up
an
astonishing
breakfast
for
the
traveller
finding
it
impossible
to
vent
her
excitement
in
any
other
way
and
meg
and
jo
fed
their
mother
like
dutiful
young
storks
while
they
listened
to
her
whispered
account
of
father's
state
mr
brooke's
promise
to
stay
and
nurse
him
the
delays
which
the
storm
occasioned
on
the
homeward
journey
and
the
unspeakable
comfort
laurie's
hopeful
face
had
given
her
when
she
arrived
worn
out
with
fatigue
anxiety
and
cold
what
a
strange
yet
pleasant
day
that
was
so
brilliant
and
gay
without
for
all
the
world
seemed
abroad
to
welcome
the
first
snow
so
quiet
and
reposeful
within
for
every
one
slept
spent
with
watching
and
a
sabbath
stillness
reigned
through
the
house
while
nodding
hannah
mounted
guard
at
the
door
with
a
blissful
sense
of
burdens
lifted
off
meg
and
jo
closed
their
weary
eyes
and
lay
at
rest
like
storm-beaten
boats
safe
at
anchor
in
a
quiet
harbor
mrs
march
would
not
leave
beth's
side
but
rested
in
the
big
chair
waking
often
to
look
at
touch
and
brood
over
her
child
like
a
miser
over
some
recovered
treasure
laurie
meanwhile
posted
off
to
comfort
amy
and
told
his
story
so
well
that
aunt
march
actually
sniffed
herself
and
never
once
said
i
told
you
so
amy
came
out
so
strong
on
this
occasion
that
i
think
the
good
thoughts
in
the
little
chapel
really
began
to
bear
fruit
she
dried
her
tears
quickly
restrained
her
impatience
to
see
her
mother
and
never
even
thought
of
the
turquoise
ring
when
the
old
lady
heartily
agreed
in
laurie's
opinion
that
she
behaved
like
a
capital
little
woman
even
polly
seemed
impressed
for
he
called
her
good
girl
blessed
her
buttons
and
begged
her
to
come
and
take
a
walk
dear
in
his
most
affable
tone
she
would
very
gladly
have
gone
out
to
enjoy
the
bright
wintry
weather
but
discovering
that
laurie
was
dropping
with
sleep
in
spite
of
manful
efforts
to
conceal
the
fact
she
persuaded
him
to
rest
on
the
sofa
while
she
wrote
a
note
to
her
mother
she
was
a
long
time
about
it
and
when
she
returned
he
was
stretched
out
with
both
arms
under
his
head
sound
asleep
while
aunt
march
had
pulled
down
the
curtains
and
sat
doing
nothing
in
an
unusual
fit
of
benignity
after
a
while
they
began
to
think
he
was
not
going
to
wake
till
night
and
i'm
not
sure
that
he
would
had
he
not
been
effectually
roused
by
amy's
cry
of
joy
at
sight
of
her
mother
there
probably
were
a
good
many
happy
little
girls
in
and
about
the
city
that
day
but
it
is
my
private
opinion
that
amy
was
the
happiest
of
all
when
she
sat
in
her
mother's
lap
and
told
her
trials
receiving
consolation
and
compensation
in
the
shape
of
approving
smiles
and
fond
caresses
they
were
alone
together
in
the
chapel
to
which
her
mother
did
not
object
when
its
purpose
was
explained
to
her
on
the
contrary
i
like
it
very
much
dear
looking
from
the
dusty
rosary
to
the
well-worn
little
book
and
the
lovely
picture
with
its
garland
of
evergreen
it
is
an
excellent
plan
to
have
some
place
where
we
can
go
to
be
quiet
when
things
vex
or
grieve
us
there
are
a
good
many
hard
times
in
this
life
of
ours
but
we
can
always
bear
them
if
we
ask
help
in
the
right
way
i
think
my
little
girl
is
learning
this
yes
mother
and
when
i
go
home
i
mean
to
have
a
corner
in
the
big
closet
to
put
my
books
and
the
copy
of
that
picture
which
i've
tried
to
make
the
woman's
face
is
not
good,--it's
too
beautiful
for
me
to
draw,--but
the
baby
is
done
better
and
i
love
it
very
much
i
like
to
think
he
was
a
little
child
once
for
then
i
don't
seem
so
far
away
and
that
helps
me
as
amy
pointed
to
the
smiling
christ-child
on
his
mother's
knee
mrs
march
saw
something
on
the
lifted
hand
that
made
her
smile
she
said
nothing
but
amy
understood
the
look
and
after
a
minute's
pause
she
added
gravely,--
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
this
but
i
forgot
it
aunt
gave
me
the
ring
to-day
she
called
me
to
her
and
kissed
me
and
put
it
on
my
finger
and
said
i
was
a
credit
to
her
and
she'd
like
to
keep
me
always
she
gave
that
funny
guard
to
keep
the
turquoise
on
as
it's
too
big
i'd
like
to
wear
them
mother
can
i
they
are
very
pretty
but
i
think
you're
rather
too
young
for
such
ornaments
amy
said
mrs
march
looking
at
the
plump
little
hand
with
the
band
of
sky-blue
stones
on
the
forefinger
and
the
quaint
guard
formed
of
two
tiny
golden
hands
clasped
together
i'll
try
not
to
be
vain
said
amy
i
don't
think
i
like
it
only
because
it's
so
pretty
but
i
want
to
wear
it
as
the
girl
in
the
story
wore
her
bracelet
to
remind
me
of
something
do
you
mean
aunt
march
asked
her
mother
laughing
no
to
remind
me
not
to
be
selfish
amy
looked
so
earnest
and
sincere
about
it
that
her
mother
stopped
laughing
and
listened
respectfully
to
the
little
plan
i've
thought
a
great
deal
lately
about
my
'bundle
of
naughties,'
and
being
selfish
is
the
largest
one
in
it
so
i'm
going
to
try
hard
to
cure
it
if
i
can
beth
isn't
selfish
and
that's
the
reason
every
one
loves
her
and
feels
so
bad
at
the
thoughts
of
losing
her
people
wouldn't
feel
half
so
bad
about
me
if
i
was
sick
and
i
don't
deserve
to
have
them
but
i'd
like
to
be
loved
and
missed
by
a
great
many
friends
so
i'm
going
to
try
and
be
like
beth
all
i
can
i'm
apt
to
forget
my
resolutions
but
if
i
had
something
always
about
me
to
remind
me
i
guess
i
should
do
better
may
i
try
this
way
yes
but
i
have
more
faith
in
the
corner
of
the
big
closet
wear
your
ring
dear
and
do
your
best
i
think
you
will
prosper
for
the
sincere
wish
to
be
good
is
half
the
battle
now
i
must
go
back
to
beth
keep
up
your
heart
little
daughter
and
we
will
soon
have
you
home
again
that
evening
while
meg
was
writing
to
her
father
to
report
the
traveller's
safe
arrival
jo
slipped
up
stairs
into
beth's
room
and
finding
her
mother
in
her
usual
place
stood
a
minute
twisting
her
fingers
in
her
hair
with
a
worried
gesture
and
an
undecided
look
what
is
it
deary
asked
mrs
march
holding
out
her
hand
with
a
face
which
invited
confidence
i
want
to
tell
you
something
mother
about
meg
how
quickly
you
guessed
yes
it's
about
her
and
though
it's
a
little
thing
it
fidgets
me
beth
is
asleep
speak
low
and
tell
me
all
about
it
that
moffat
hasn't
been
here
i
hope
asked
mrs
march
rather
sharply
no
i
should
have
shut
the
door
in
his
face
if
he
had
said
jo
settling
herself
on
the
floor
at
her
mother's
feet
last
summer
meg
left
a
pair
of
gloves
over
at
the
laurences'
and
only
one
was
returned
we
forgot
all
about
it
till
teddy
told
me
that
mr
brooke
had
it
he
kept
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
once
it
fell
out
and
teddy
joked
him
about
it
and
mr
brooke
owned
that
he
liked
meg
but
didn't
dare
say
so
she
was
so
young
and
he
so
poor
now
isn't
it
a
_dread_ful
state
of
things
do
you
think
meg
cares
for
him
asked
mrs
march
with
an
anxious
look
mercy
me
i
don't
know
anything
about
love
and
such
nonsense
cried
jo
with
a
funny
mixture
of
interest
and
contempt
in
novels
the
girls
show
it
by
starting
and
blushing
fainting
away
growing
thin
and
acting
like
fools
now
meg
does
not
do
anything
of
the
sort
she
eats
and
drinks
and
sleeps
like
a
sensible
creature
she
looks
straight
in
my
face
when
i
talk
about
that
man
and
only
blushes
a
little
bit
when
teddy
jokes
about
lovers
i
forbid
him
to
do
it
but
he
doesn't
mind
me
as
he
ought
then
you
fancy
that
meg
is
_not_
interested
in
john
who
cried
jo
staring
mr
brooke
i
call
him
'john'
now
we
fell
into
the
way
of
doing
so
at
the
hospital
and
he
likes
it
oh
dear
i
know
you'll
take
his
part
he's
been
good
to
father
and
you
won't
send
him
away
but
let
meg
marry
him
if
she
wants
to
mean
thing
to
go
petting
papa
and
helping
you
just
to
wheedle
you
into
liking
him
and
jo
pulled
her
hair
again
with
a
wrathful
tweak
my
dear
don't
get
angry
about
it
and
i
will
tell
you
how
it
happened
john
went
with
me
at
mr
laurence's
request
and
was
so
devoted
to
poor
father
that
we
couldn't
help
getting
fond
of
him
he
was
perfectly
open
and
honorable
about
meg
for
he
told
us
he
loved
her
but
would
earn
a
comfortable
home
before
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
only
wanted
our
leave
to
love
her
and
work
for
her
and
the
right
to
make
her
love
him
if
he
could
he
is
a
truly
excellent
young
man
and
we
could
not
refuse
to
listen
to
him
but
i
will
not
consent
to
meg's
engaging
herself
so
young
of
course
not
it
would
be
idiotic
i
knew
there
was
mischief
brewing
i
felt
it
and
now
it's
worse
than
i
imagined
i
just
wish
i
could
marry
meg
myself
and
keep
her
safe
in
the
family
this
odd
arrangement
made
mrs
march
smile
but
she
said
gravely
jo
i
confide
in
you
and
don't
wish
you
to
say
anything
to
meg
yet
when
john
comes
back
and
i
see
them
together
i
can
judge
better
of
her
feelings
toward
him
she'll
see
his
in
those
handsome
eyes
that
she
talks
about
and
then
it
will
be
all
up
with
her
she's
got
such
a
soft
heart
it
will
melt
like
butter
in
the
sun
if
any
one
looks
sentimentally
at
her
she
read
the
short
reports
he
sent
more
than
she
did
your
letters
and
pinched
me
when
i
spoke
of
it
and
likes
brown
eyes
and
doesn't
think
john
an
ugly
name
and
she'll
go
and
fall
in
love
and
there's
an
end
of
peace
and
fun
and
cosy
times
together
i
see
it
all
they'll
go
lovering
around
the
house
and
we
shall
have
to
dodge
meg
will
be
absorbed
and
no
good
to
me
any
more
brooke
will
scratch
up
a
fortune
somehow
carry
her
off
and
make
a
hole
in
the
family
and
i
shall
break
my
heart
and
everything
will
be
abominably
uncomfortable
oh
dear
me
why
weren't
we
all
boys
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
bother
jo
leaned
her
chin
on
her
knees
in
a
disconsolate
attitude
and
shook
her
fist
at
the
reprehensible
john
mrs
march
sighed
and
jo
looked
up
with
an
air
of
relief
you
don't
like
it
mother
i'm
glad
of
it
let's
send
him
about
his
business
and
not
tell
meg
a
word
of
it
but
all
be
happy
together
as
we
always
have
been
i
did
wrong
to
sigh
jo
it
is
natural
and
right
you
should
all
go
to
homes
of
your
own
in
time
but
i
do
want
to
keep
my
girls
as
long
as
i
can
and
i
am
sorry
that
this
happened
so
soon
for
meg
is
only
seventeen
and
it
will
be
some
years
before
john
can
make
a
home
for
her
your
father
and
i
have
agreed
that
she
shall
not
bind
herself
in
any
way
nor
be
married
before
twenty
if
she
and
john
love
one
another
they
can
wait
and
test
the
love
by
doing
so
she
is
conscientious
and
i
have
no
fear
of
her
treating
him
unkindly
my
pretty
tender-hearted
girl
i
hope
things
will
go
happily
with
her
hadn't
you
rather
have
her
marry
a
rich
man
asked
jo
as
her
mother's
voice
faltered
a
little
over
the
last
words
money
is
a
good
and
useful
thing
jo
and
i
hope
my
girls
will
never
feel
the
need
of
it
too
bitterly
nor
be
tempted
by
too
much
i
should
like
to
know
that
john
was
firmly
established
in
some
good
business
which
gave
him
an
income
large
enough
to
keep
free
from
debt
and
make
meg
comfortable
i'm
not
ambitious
for
a
splendid
fortune
a
fashionable
position
or
a
great
name
for
my
girls
if
rank
and
money
come
with
love
and
virtue
also
i
should
accept
them
gratefully
and
enjoy
your
good
fortune
but
i
know
by
experience
how
much
genuine
happiness
can
be
had
in
a
plain
little
house
where
the
daily
bread
is
earned
and
some
privations
give
sweetness
to
the
few
pleasures
i
am
content
to
see
meg
begin
humbly
for
if
i
am
not
mistaken
she
will
be
rich
in
the
possession
of
a
good
man's
heart
and
that
is
better
than
a
fortune
i
understand
mother
and
quite
agree
but
i'm
disappointed
about
meg
for
i'd
planned
to
have
her
marry
teddy
by
and
by
and
sit
in
the
lap
of
luxury
all
her
days
wouldn't
it
be
nice
asked
jo
looking
up
with
a
brighter
face
he
is
younger
than
she
you
know
began
mrs
march
but
jo
broke
in,--
only
a
little
he's
old
for
his
age
and
tall
and
can
be
quite
grown-up
in
his
manners
if
he
likes
then
he's
rich
and
generous
and
good
and
loves
us
all
and
_i_
say
it's
a
pity
my
plan
is
spoilt
i'm
afraid
laurie
is
hardly
grown
up
enough
for
meg
and
altogether
too
much
of
a
weathercock
just
now
for
any
one
to
depend
on
don't
make
plans
jo
but
let
time
and
their
own
hearts
mate
your
friends
we
can't
meddle
safely
in
such
matters
and
had
better
not
get
'romantic
rubbish,'
as
you
call
it
into
our
heads
lest
it
spoil
our
friendship
well
i
won't
but
i
hate
to
see
things
going
all
criss-cross
and
getting
snarled
up
when
a
pull
here
and
a
snip
there
would
straighten
it
out
i
wish
wearing
flat-irons
on
our
heads
would
keep
us
from
growing
up
but
buds
will
be
roses
and
kittens
cats,--more's
the
pity
what's
that
about
flat-irons
and
cats
asked
meg
as
she
crept
into
the
room
with
the
finished
letter
in
her
hand
only
one
of
my
stupid
speeches
i'm
going
to
bed
come
peggy
said
jo
unfolding
herself
like
an
animated
puzzle
quite
right
and
beautifully
written
please
add
that
i
send
my
love
to
john
said
mrs
march
as
she
glanced
over
the
letter
and
gave
it
back
do
you
call
him
'john'
asked
meg
smiling
with
her
innocent
eyes
looking
down
into
her
mother's
yes
he
has
been
like
a
son
to
us
and
we
are
very
fond
of
him
replied
mrs
march
returning
the
look
with
a
keen
one
i'm
glad
of
that
he
is
so
lonely
good-night
mother
dear
it
is
so
inexpressibly
comfortable
to
have
you
here
was
meg's
quiet
answer
the
kiss
her
mother
gave
her
was
a
very
tender
one
and
as
she
went
away
mrs
march
said
with
a
mixture
of
satisfaction
and
regret
she
does
not
love
john
yet
but
will
soon
learn
to
illustration
tail-piece
illustration
letters
xxi
laurie
makes
mischief
and
jo
makes
peace
jo's
face
was
a
study
next
day
for
the
secret
rather
weighed
upon
her
and
she
found
it
hard
not
to
look
mysterious
and
important
meg
observed
it
but
did
not
trouble
herself
to
make
inquiries
for
she
had
learned
that
the
best
way
to
manage
jo
was
by
the
law
of
contraries
so
she
felt
sure
of
being
told
everything
if
she
did
not
ask
she
was
rather
surprised
therefore
when
the
silence
remained
unbroken
and
jo
assumed
a
patronizing
air
which
decidedly
aggravated
meg
who
in
her
turn
assumed
an
air
of
dignified
reserve
and
devoted
herself
to
her
mother
this
left
jo
to
her
own
devices
for
mrs
march
had
taken
her
place
as
nurse
and
bade
her
rest
exercise
and
amuse
herself
after
her
long
confinement
amy
being
gone
laurie
was
her
only
refuge
and
much
as
she
enjoyed
his
society
she
rather
dreaded
him
just
then
for
he
was
an
incorrigible
tease
and
she
feared
he
would
coax
her
secret
from
her
she
was
quite
right
for
the
mischief-loving
lad
no
sooner
suspected
a
mystery
than
he
set
himself
to
find
it
out
and
led
jo
a
trying
life
of
it
he
wheedled
bribed
ridiculed
threatened
and
scolded
affected
indifference
that
he
might
surprise
the
truth
from
her
declared
he
knew
then
that
he
didn't
care
and
at
last
by
dint
of
perseverance
he
satisfied
himself
that
it
concerned
meg
and
mr
brooke
feeling
indignant
that
he
was
not
taken
into
his
tutor's
confidence
he
set
his
wits
to
work
to
devise
some
proper
retaliation
for
the
slight
meg
meanwhile
had
apparently
forgotten
the
matter
and
was
absorbed
in
preparations
for
her
father's
return
but
all
of
a
sudden
a
change
seemed
to
come
over
her
and
for
a
day
or
two
she
was
quite
unlike
herself
she
started
when
spoken
to
blushed
when
looked
at
was
very
quiet
and
sat
over
her
sewing
with
a
timid
troubled
look
on
her
face
to
her
mother's
inquiries
she
answered
that
she
was
quite
well
and
jo's
she
silenced
by
begging
to
be
let
alone
she
feels
it
in
the
air--love
i
mean--and
she's
going
very
fast
she's
got
most
of
the
symptoms,--is
twittery
and
cross
doesn't
eat
lies
awake
and
mopes
in
corners
i
caught
her
singing
that
song
he
gave
her
and
once
she
said
'john,'
as
you
do
and
then
turned
as
red
as
a
poppy
whatever
shall
we
do
said
jo
looking
ready
for
any
measures
however
violent
nothing
but
wait
let
her
alone
be
kind
and
patient
and
father's
coming
will
settle
everything
replied
her
mother
here's
a
note
to
you
meg
all
sealed
up
how
odd
teddy
never
seals
mine
said
jo
next
day
as
she
distributed
the
contents
of
the
little
post-office
mrs
march
and
jo
were
deep
in
their
own
affairs
when
a
sound
from
meg
made
them
look
up
to
see
her
staring
at
her
note
with
a
frightened
face
my
child
what
is
it
cried
her
mother
running
to
her
while
jo
tried
to
take
the
paper
which
had
done
the
mischief
it's
all
a
mistake--he
didn't
send
it
o
jo
how
could
you
do
it
and
meg
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
crying
as
if
her
heart
was
quite
broken
me
i've
done
nothing
what's
she
talking
about
cried
jo
bewildered
meg's
mild
eyes
kindled
with
anger
as
she
pulled
a
crumpled
note
from
her
pocket
and
threw
it
at
jo
saying
reproachfully,--
you
wrote
it
and
that
bad
boy
helped
you
how
could
you
be
so
rude
so
mean
and
cruel
to
us
both
jo
hardly
heard
her
for
she
and
her
mother
were
reading
the
note
which
was
written
in
a
peculiar
hand
illustration
jo
and
her
mother
were
reading
the
note
my
dearest
margaret,--
i
can
no
longer
restrain
my
passion
and
must
know
my
fate
before
i
return
i
dare
not
tell
your
parents
yet
but
i
think
they
would
consent
if
they
knew
that
we
adored
one
another
mr
laurence
will
help
me
to
some
good
place
and
then
my
sweet
girl
you
will
make
me
happy
i
implore
you
to
say
nothing
to
your
family
yet
but
to
send
one
word
of
hope
through
laurie
to
your
devoted
john
oh
the
little
villain
that's
the
way
he
meant
to
pay
me
for
keeping
my
word
to
mother
i'll
give
him
a
hearty
scolding
and
bring
him
over
to
beg
pardon
cried
jo
burning
to
execute
immediate
justice
but
her
mother
held
her
back
saying
with
a
look
she
seldom
wore,--
stop
jo
you
must
clear
yourself
first
you
have
played
so
many
pranks
that
i
am
afraid
you
have
had
a
hand
in
this
on
my
word
mother
i
haven't
i
never
saw
that
note
before
and
don't
know
anything
about
it
as
true
as
i
live
said
jo
so
earnestly
that
they
believed
her
if
i
_had_
taken
a
part
in
it
i'd
have
done
it
better
than
this
and
have
written
a
sensible
note
i
should
think
you'd
have
known
mr
brooke
wouldn't
write
such
stuff
as
that
she
added
scornfully
tossing
down
the
paper
it's
like
his
writing
faltered
meg
comparing
it
with
the
note
in
her
hand
o
meg
you
didn't
answer
it
cried
mrs
march
quickly
yes
i
did
and
meg
hid
her
face
again
overcome
with
shame
here's
a
scrape
_do_
let
me
bring
that
wicked
boy
over
to
explain
and
be
lectured
i
can't
rest
till
i
get
hold
of
him
and
jo
made
for
the
door
again
hush
let
me
manage
this
for
it
is
worse
than
i
thought
margaret
tell
me
the
whole
story
commanded
mrs
march
sitting
down
by
meg
yet
keeping
hold
of
jo
lest
she
should
fly
off
i
received
the
first
letter
from
laurie
who
didn't
look
as
if
he
knew
anything
about
it
began
meg
without
looking
up
i
was
worried
at
first
and
meant
to
tell
you
then
i
remembered
how
you
liked
mr
brooke
so
i
thought
you
wouldn't
mind
if
i
kept
my
little
secret
for
a
few
days
i'm
so
silly
that
i
liked
to
think
no
one
knew
and
while
i
was
deciding
what
to
say
i
felt
like
the
girls
in
books
who
have
such
things
to
do
forgive
me
mother
i'm
paid
for
my
silliness
now
i
never
can
look
him
in
the
face
again
what
did
you
say
to
him
asked
mrs
march
i
only
said
i
was
too
young
to
do
anything
about
it
yet
that
i
didn't
wish
to
have
secrets
from
you
and
he
must
speak
to
father
i
was
very
grateful
for
his
kindness
and
would
be
his
friend
but
nothing
more
for
a
long
while
mrs
march
smiled
as
if
well
pleased
and
jo
clapped
her
hands
exclaiming
with
a
laugh,--
you
are
almost
equal
to
caroline
percy
who
was
a
pattern
of
prudence
tell
on
meg
what
did
he
say
to
that
he
writes
in
a
different
way
entirely
telling
me
that
he
never
sent
any
love-letter
at
all
and
is
very
sorry
that
my
roguish
sister
jo
should
take
such
liberties
with
our
names
it's
very
kind
and
respectful
but
think
how
dreadful
for
me
meg
leaned
against
her
mother
looking
the
image
of
despair
and
jo
tramped
about
the
room
calling
laurie
names
all
of
a
sudden
she
stopped
caught
up
the
two
notes
and
after
looking
at
them
closely
said
decidedly
i
don't
believe
brooke
ever
saw
either
of
these
letters
teddy
wrote
both
and
keeps
yours
to
crow
over
me
with
because
i
wouldn't
tell
him
my
secret
don't
have
any
secrets
jo
tell
it
to
mother
and
keep
out
of
trouble
as
i
should
have
done
said
meg
warningly
bless
you
child
mother
told
me
that
will
do
jo
i'll
comfort
meg
while
you
go
and
get
laurie
i
shall
sift
the
matter
to
the
bottom
and
put
a
stop
to
such
pranks
at
once
away
ran
jo
and
mrs
march
gently
told
meg
mr
brooke's
real
feelings
now
dear
what
are
your
own
do
you
love
him
enough
to
wait
till
he
can
make
a
home
for
you
or
will
you
keep
yourself
quite
free
for
the
present
i've
been
so
scared
and
worried
i
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
lovers
for
a
long
while,--perhaps
never
answered
meg
petulantly
if
john
_doesn't_
know
anything
about
this
nonsense
don't
tell
him
and
make
jo
and
laurie
hold
their
tongues
i
won't
be
deceived
and
plagued
and
made
a
fool
of,--it's
a
shame
seeing
that
meg's
usually
gentle
temper
was
roused
and
her
pride
hurt
by
this
mischievous
joke
mrs
march
soothed
her
by
promises
of
entire
silence
and
great
discretion
for
the
future
the
instant
laurie's
step
was
heard
in
the
hall
meg
fled
into
the
study
and
mrs
march
received
the
culprit
alone
jo
had
not
told
him
why
he
was
wanted
fearing
he
wouldn't
come
but
he
knew
the
minute
he
saw
mrs
march's
face
and
stood
twirling
his
hat
with
a
guilty
air
which
convicted
him
at
once
jo
was
dismissed
but
chose
to
march
up
and
down
the
hall
like
a
sentinel
having
some
fear
that
the
prisoner
might
bolt
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
parlor
rose
and
fell
for
half
an
hour
but
what
happened
during
that
interview
the
girls
never
knew
when
they
were
called
in
laurie
was
standing
by
their
mother
with
such
a
penitent
face
that
jo
forgave
him
on
the
spot
but
did
not
think
it
wise
to
betray
the
fact
meg
received
his
humble
apology
and
was
much
comforted
by
the
assurance
that
brooke
knew
nothing
of
the
joke
i'll
never
tell
him
to
my
dying
day,--wild
horses
sha'n't
drag
it
out
of
me
so
you'll
forgive
me
meg
and
i'll
do
anything
to
show
how
out-and-out
sorry
i
am
he
added
looking
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
i'll
try
but
it
was
a
very
ungentlemanly
thing
to
do
i
didn't
think
you
could
be
so
sly
and
malicious
laurie
replied
meg
trying
to
hide
her
maidenly
confusion
under
a
gravely
reproachful
air
it
was
altogether
abominable
and
i
don't
deserve
to
be
spoken
to
for
a
month
but
you
will
though
won't
you
and
laurie
folded
his
hands
together
with
such
an
imploring
gesture
as
he
spoke
in
his
irresistibly
persuasive
tone
that
it
was
impossible
to
frown
upon
him
in
spite
of
his
scandalous
behavior
meg
pardoned
him
and
mrs
march's
grave
face
relaxed
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
keep
sober
when
she
heard
him
declare
that
he
would
atone
for
his
sins
by
all
sorts
of
penances
and
abase
himself
like
a
worm
before
the
injured
damsel
jo
stood
aloof
meanwhile
trying
to
harden
her
heart
against
him
and
succeeding
only
in
primming
up
her
face
into
an
expression
of
entire
disapprobation
laurie
looked
at
her
once
or
twice
but
as
she
showed
no
sign
of
relenting
he
felt
injured
and
turned
his
back
on
her
till
the
others
were
done
with
him
when
he
made
her
a
low
bow
and
walked
off
without
a
word
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
she
wished
she
had
been
more
forgiving
and
when
meg
and
her
mother
went
upstairs
she
felt
lonely
and
longed
for
teddy
after
resisting
for
some
time
she
yielded
to
the
impulse
and
armed
with
a
book
to
return
went
over
to
the
big
house
is
mr
laurence
in
asked
jo
of
a
housemaid
who
was
coming
down
stairs
yes
miss
but
i
don't
believe
he's
seeable
just
yet
why
not
is
he
ill
la
no
miss
but
he's
had
a
scene
with
mr
laurie
who
is
in
one
of
his
tantrums
about
something
which
vexes
the
old
gentleman
so
i
dursn't
go
nigh
him
where
is
laurie
shut
up
in
his
room
and
he
won't
answer
though
i've
been
a-tapping
i
don't
know
what's
to
become
of
the
dinner
for
it's
ready
and
there's
no
one
to
eat
it
i'll
go
and
see
what
the
matter
is
i'm
not
afraid
of
either
of
them
up
went
jo
and
knocked
smartly
on
the
door
of
laurie's
little
study
stop
that
or
i'll
open
the
door
and
make
you
called
out
the
young
gentleman
in
a
threatening
tone
jo
immediately
knocked
again
the
door
flew
open
and
in
she
bounced
before
laurie
could
recover
from
his
surprise
seeing
that
he
really
_was_
out
of
temper
jo
who
knew
how
to
manage
him
assumed
a
contrite
expression
and
going
artistically
down
upon
her
knees
said
meekly
please
forgive
me
for
being
so
cross
i
came
to
make
it
up
and
can't
go
away
till
i
have
it's
all
right
get
up
and
don't
be
a
goose
jo
was
the
cavalier
reply
to
her
petition
illustration
get
up
and
don't
be
a
goose
thank
you
i
will
could
i
ask
what's
the
matter
you
don't
look
exactly
easy
in
your
mind
i've
been
shaken
and
i
won't
bear
it
growled
laurie
indignantly
who
did
it
demanded
jo
grandfather
if
it
had
been
any
one
else
i'd
have--
and
the
injured
youth
finished
his
sentence
by
an
energetic
gesture
of
the
right
arm
that's
nothing
i
often
shake
you
and
you
don't
mind
said
jo
soothingly
pooh
you're
a
girl
and
it's
fun
but
i'll
allow
no
man
to
shake
_me_
i
don't
think
any
one
would
care
to
try
it
if
you
looked
as
much
like
a
thunder-cloud
as
you
do
now
why
were
you
treated
so
just
because
i
wouldn't
say
what
your
mother
wanted
me
for
i'd
promised
not
to
tell
and
of
course
i
wasn't
going
to
break
my
word
couldn't
you
satisfy
your
grandpa
in
any
other
way
no
he
_would_
have
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
i'd
have
told
my
part
of
the
scrape
if
i
could
without
bringing
meg
in
as
i
couldn't
i
held
my
tongue
and
bore
the
scolding
till
the
old
gentleman
collared
me
then
i
got
angry
and
bolted
for
fear
i
should
forget
myself
it
wasn't
nice
but
he's
sorry
i
know
so
go
down
and
make
up
i'll
help
you
hanged
if
i
do
i'm
not
going
to
be
lectured
and
pummelled
by
every
one
just
for
a
bit
of
a
frolic
i
_was_
sorry
about
meg
and
begged
pardon
like
a
man
but
i
won't
do
it
again
when
i
wasn't
in
the
wrong
he
didn't
know
that
he
ought
to
trust
me
and
not
act
as
if
i
was
a
baby
it's
no
use
jo
he's
got
to
learn
that
i'm
able
to
take
care
of
myself
and
don't
need
any
one's
apron-string
to
hold
on
by
what
pepper-pots
you
are
sighed
jo
how
do
you
mean
to
settle
this
affair
well
he
ought
to
beg
pardon
and
believe
me
when
i
say
i
can't
tell
him
what
the
fuss's
about
bless
you
he
won't
do
that
i
won't
go
down
till
he
does
now
teddy
be
sensible
let
it
pass
and
i'll
explain
what
i
can
you
can't
stay
here
so
what's
the
use
of
being
melodramatic
i
don't
intend
to
stay
here
long
any
way
i'll
slip
off
and
take
a
journey
somewhere
and
when
grandpa
misses
me
he'll
come
round
fast
enough
i
dare
say
but
you
ought
not
to
go
and
worry
him
don't
preach
i'll
go
to
washington
and
see
brooke
it's
gay
there
and
i'll
enjoy
myself
after
the
troubles
what
fun
you'd
have
i
wish
i
could
run
off
too
said
jo
forgetting
her
part
of
mentor
in
lively
visions
of
martial
life
at
the
capital
come
on
then
why
not
you
go
and
surprise
your
father
and
i'll
stir
up
old
brooke
it
would
be
a
glorious
joke
let's
do
it
jo
we'll
leave
a
letter
saying
we
are
all
right
and
trot
off
at
once
i've
got
money
enough
it
will
do
you
good
and
be
no
harm
as
you
go
to
your
father
for
a
moment
jo
looked
as
if
she
would
agree
for
wild
as
the
plan
was
it
just
suited
her
she
was
tired
of
care
and
confinement
longed
for
change
and
thoughts
of
her
father
blended
temptingly
with
the
novel
charms
of
camps
and
hospitals
liberty
and
fun
her
eyes
kindled
as
they
turned
wistfully
toward
the
window
but
they
fell
on
the
old
house
opposite
and
she
shook
her
head
with
sorrowful
decision
if
i
was
a
boy
we'd
run
away
together
and
have
a
capital
time
but
as
i'm
a
miserable
girl
i
must
be
proper
and
stop
at
home
don't
tempt
me
teddy
it's
a
crazy
plan
that's
the
fun
of
it
began
laurie
who
had
got
a
wilful
fit
on
him
and
was
possessed
to
break
out
of
bounds
in
some
way
hold
your
tongue
cried
jo
covering
her
ears
'prunes
and
prisms'
are
my
doom
and
i
may
as
well
make
up
my
mind
to
it
i
came
here
to
moralize
not
to
hear
about
things
that
make
me
skip
to
think
of
illustration
hold
your
tongue
cried
jo
covering
her
ears
i
know
meg
would
wet-blanket
such
a
proposal
but
i
thought
you
had
more
spirit
began
laurie
insinuatingly
bad
boy
be
quiet
sit
down
and
think
of
your
own
sins
don't
go
making
me
add
to
mine
if
i
get
your
grandpa
to
apologize
for
the
shaking
will
you
give
up
running
away
asked
jo
seriously
yes
but
you
won't
do
it
answered
laurie
who
wished
to
make
up
but
felt
that
his
outraged
dignity
must
be
appeased
first
if
i
can
manage
the
young
one
i
can
the
old
one
muttered
jo
as
she
walked
away
leaving
laurie
bent
over
a
railroad
map
with
his
head
propped
up
on
both
hands
come
in
and
mr
laurence's
gruff
voice
sounded
gruffer
than
ever
as
jo
tapped
at
his
door
it's
only
me
sir
come
to
return
a
book
she
said
blandly
as
she
entered
want
any
more
asked
the
old
gentleman
looking
grim
and
vexed
but
trying
not
to
show
it
yes
please
i
like
old
sam
so
well
i
think
i'll
try
the
second
volume
returned
jo
hoping
to
propitiate
him
by
accepting
a
second
dose
of
boswell's
johnson
as
he
had
recommended
that
lively
work
the
shaggy
eyebrows
unbent
a
little
as
he
rolled
the
steps
toward
the
shelf
where
the
johnsonian
literature
was
placed
jo
skipped
up
and
sitting
on
the
top
step
affected
to
be
searching
for
her
book
but
was
really
wondering
how
best
to
introduce
the
dangerous
object
of
her
visit
mr
laurence
seemed
to
suspect
that
something
was
brewing
in
her
mind
for
after
taking
several
brisk
turns
about
the
room
he
faced
round
on
her
speaking
so
abruptly
that
rasselas
tumbled
face
downward
on
the
floor
what
has
that
boy
been
about
don't
try
to
shield
him
i
know
he
has
been
in
mischief
by
the
way
he
acted
when
he
came
home
i
can't
get
a
word
from
him
and
when
i
threatened
to
shake
the
truth
out
of
him
he
bolted
upstairs
and
locked
himself
into
his
room
he
did
do
wrong
but
we
forgave
him
and
all
promised
not
to
say
a
word
to
any
one
began
jo
reluctantly
that
won't
do
he
shall
not
shelter
himself
behind
a
promise
from
you
soft-hearted
girls
if
he's
done
anything
amiss
he
shall
confess
beg
pardon
and
be
punished
out
with
it
jo
i
won't
be
kept
in
the
dark
mr
laurence
looked
so
alarming
and
spoke
so
sharply
that
jo
would
have
gladly
run
away
if
she
could
but
she
was
perched
aloft
on
the
steps
and
he
stood
at
the
foot
a
lion
in
the
path
so
she
had
to
stay
and
brave
it
out
illustration
he
stood
at
the
foot
like
a
lion
in
the
path
indeed
sir
i
cannot
tell
mother
forbade
it
laurie
has
confessed
asked
pardon
and
been
punished
quite
enough
we
don't
keep
silence
to
shield
him
but
some
one
else
and
it
will
make
more
trouble
if
you
interfere
please
don't
it
was
partly
my
fault
but
it's
all
right
now
so
let's
forget
it
and
talk
about
the
'rambler,'
or
something
pleasant
hang
the
'rambler!'
come
down
and
give
me
your
word
that
this
harum-scarum
boy
of
mine
hasn't
done
anything
ungrateful
or
impertinent
if
he
has
after
all
your
kindness
to
him
i'll
thrash
him
with
my
own
hands
the
threat
sounded
awful
but
did
not
alarm
jo
for
she
knew
the
irascible
old
gentleman
would
never
lift
a
finger
against
his
grandson
whatever
he
might
say
to
the
contrary
she
obediently
descended
and
made
as
light
of
the
prank
as
she
could
without
betraying
meg
or
forgetting
the
truth
hum--ha--well
if
the
boy
held
his
tongue
because
he
promised
and
not
from
obstinacy
i'll
forgive
him
he's
a
stubborn
fellow
and
hard
to
manage
said
mr
laurence
rubbing
up
his
hair
till
it
looked
as
if
he
had
been
out
in
a
gale
and
smoothing
the
frown
from
his
brow
with
an
air
of
relief
so
am
i
but
a
kind
word
will
govern
me
when
all
the
king's
horses
and
all
the
king's
men
couldn't
said
jo
trying
to
say
a
kind
word
for
her
friend
who
seemed
to
get
out
of
one
scrape
only
to
fall
into
another
you
think
i'm
not
kind
to
him
hey
was
the
sharp
answer
oh
dear
no
sir
you
are
rather
too
kind
sometimes
and
then
just
a
trifle
hasty
when
he
tries
your
patience
don't
you
think
you
are
jo
was
determined
to
have
it
out
now
and
tried
to
look
quite
placid
though
she
quaked
a
little
after
her
bold
speech
to
her
great
relief
and
surprise
the
old
gentleman
only
threw
his
spectacles
on
to
the
table
with
a
rattle
and
exclaimed
frankly,--
you're
right
girl
i
am
i
love
the
boy
but
he
tries
my
patience
past
bearing
and
i
don't
know
how
it
will
end
if
we
go
on
so
i'll
tell
you
he'll
run
away
jo
was
sorry
for
that
speech
the
minute
it
was
made
she
meant
to
warn
him
that
laurie
would
not
bear
much
restraint
and
hoped
he
would
be
more
forbearing
with
the
lad
mr
laurence's
ruddy
face
changed
suddenly
and
he
sat
down
with
a
troubled
glance
at
the
picture
of
a
handsome
man
which
hung
over
his
table
it
was
laurie's
father
who
_had_
run
away
in
his
youth
and
married
against
the
imperious
old
man's
will
jo
fancied
he
remembered
and
regretted
the
past
and
she
wished
she
had
held
her
tongue
he
won't
do
it
unless
he
is
very
much
worried
and
only
threatens
it
sometimes
when
he
gets
tired
of
studying
i
often
think
i
should
like
to
especially
since
my
hair
was
cut
so
if
you
ever
miss
us
you
may
advertise
for
two
boys
and
look
among
the
ships
bound
for
india
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
and
mr
laurence
looked
relieved
evidently
taking
the
whole
as
a
joke
you
hussy
how
dare
you
talk
in
that
way
where's
your
respect
for
me
and
your
proper
bringing
up
bless
the
boys
and
girls
what
torments
they
are
yet
we
can't
do
without
them
he
said
pinching
her
cheeks
good-humoredly
go
and
bring
that
boy
down
to
his
dinner
tell
him
it's
all
right
and
advise
him
not
to
put
on
tragedy
airs
with
his
grandfather
i
won't
bear
it
he
won't
come
sir
he
feels
badly
because
you
didn't
believe
him
when
he
said
he
couldn't
tell
i
think
the
shaking
hurt
his
feelings
very
much
jo
tried
to
look
pathetic
but
must
have
failed
for
mr
laurence
began
to
laugh
and
she
knew
the
day
was
won
i'm
sorry
for
that
and
ought
to
thank
him
for
not
shaking
_me_
i
suppose
what
the
dickens
does
the
fellow
expect
and
the
old
gentleman
looked
a
trifle
ashamed
of
his
own
testiness
if
i
were
you
i'd
write
him
an
apology
sir
he
says
he
won't
come
down
till
he
has
one
and
talks
about
washington
and
goes
on
in
an
absurd
way
a
formal
apology
will
make
him
see
how
foolish
he
is
and
bring
him
down
quite
amiable
try
it
he
likes
fun
and
this
way
is
better
than
talking
i'll
carry
it
up
and
teach
him
his
duty
mr
laurence
gave
her
a
sharp
look
and
put
on
his
spectacles
saying
slowly
you're
a
sly
puss
but
i
don't
mind
being
managed
by
you
and
beth
here
give
me
a
bit
of
paper
and
let
us
have
done
with
this
nonsense
the
note
was
written
in
the
terms
which
one
gentleman
would
use
to
another
after
offering
some
deep
insult
jo
dropped
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
mr
laurence's
bald
head
and
ran
up
to
slip
the
apology
under
laurie's
door
advising
him
through
the
key-hole
to
be
submissive
decorous
and
a
few
other
agreeable
impossibilities
finding
the
door
locked
again
she
left
the
note
to
do
its
work
and
was
going
quietly
away
when
the
young
gentleman
slid
down
the
banisters
and
waited
for
her
at
the
bottom
saying
with
his
most
virtuous
expression
of
countenance
what
a
good
fellow
you
are
jo
did
you
get
blown
up
he
added
laughing
no
he
was
pretty
mild
on
the
whole
ah
i
got
it
all
round
even
you
cast
me
off
over
there
and
i
felt
just
ready
to
go
to
the
deuce
he
began
apologetically
don't
talk
in
that
way
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
begin
again
teddy
my
son
i
keep
turning
over
new
leaves
and
spoiling
them
as
i
used
to
spoil
my
copy-books
and
i
make
so
many
beginnings
there
never
will
be
an
end
he
said
dolefully
go
and
eat
your
dinner
you'll
feel
better
after
it
men
always
croak
when
they
are
hungry
and
jo
whisked
out
at
the
front
door
after
that
that's
a
'label'
on
my
'sect,'
answered
laurie
quoting
amy
as
he
went
to
partake
of
humble-pie
dutifully
with
his
grandfather
who
was
quite
saintly
in
temper
and
overwhelmingly
respectful
in
manner
all
the
rest
of
the
day
every
one
thought
the
matter
ended
and
the
little
cloud
blown
over
but
the
mischief
was
done
for
though
others
forgot
it
meg
remembered
she
never
alluded
to
a
certain
person
but
she
thought
of
him
a
good
deal
dreamed
dreams
more
than
ever
and
once
jo
rummaging
her
sister's
desk
for
stamps
found
a
bit
of
paper
scribbled
over
with
the
words
mrs
john
brooke
whereat
she
groaned
tragically
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
feeling
that
laurie's
prank
had
hastened
the
evil
day
for
her
illustration
beth
was
soon
able
to
lie
on
the
study
sofa
all
day
xxii
pleasant
meadows
like
sunshine
after
storm
were
the
peaceful
weeks
which
followed
the
invalids
improved
rapidly
and
mr
march
began
to
talk
of
returning
early
in
the
new
year
beth
was
soon
able
to
lie
on
the
study
sofa
all
day
amusing
herself
with
the
well-beloved
cats
at
first
and
in
time
with
doll's
sewing
which
had
fallen
sadly
behindhand
her
once
active
limbs
were
so
stiff
and
feeble
that
jo
took
her
a
daily
airing
about
the
house
in
her
strong
arms
meg
cheerfully
blackened
and
burnt
her
white
hands
cooking
delicate
messes
for
the
dear
while
amy
a
loyal
slave
of
the
ring
celebrated
her
return
by
giving
away
as
many
of
her
treasures
as
she
could
prevail
on
her
sisters
to
accept
as
christmas
approached
the
usual
mysteries
began
to
haunt
the
house
and
jo
frequently
convulsed
the
family
by
proposing
utterly
impossible
or
magnificently
absurd
ceremonies
in
honor
of
this
unusually
merry
christmas
laurie
was
equally
impracticable
and
would
have
had
bonfires
sky-rockets
and
triumphal
arches
if
he
had
had
his
own
way
after
many
skirmishes
and
snubbings
the
ambitious
pair
were
considered
effectually
quenched
and
went
about
with
forlorn
faces
which
were
rather
belied
by
explosions
of
laughter
when
the
two
got
together
several
days
of
unusually
mild
weather
fitly
ushered
in
a
splendid
christmas
day
hannah
felt
in
her
bones
that
it
was
going
to
be
an
unusually
fine
day
and
she
proved
herself
a
true
prophetess
for
everybody
and
everything
seemed
bound
to
produce
a
grand
success
to
begin
with
mr
march
wrote
that
he
should
soon
be
with
them
then
beth
felt
uncommonly
well
that
morning
and
being
dressed
in
her
mother's
gift,--a
soft
crimson
merino
wrapper,--was
borne
in
triumph
to
the
window
to
behold
the
offering
of
jo
and
laurie
the
unquenchables
had
done
their
best
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
for
like
elves
they
had
worked
by
night
and
conjured
up
a
comical
surprise
out
in
the
garden
stood
a
stately
snow-maiden
crowned
with
holly
bearing
a
basket
of
fruit
and
flowers
in
one
hand
a
great
roll
of
new
music
in
the
other
a
perfect
rainbow
of
an
afghan
round
her
chilly
shoulders
and
a
christmas
carol
issuing
from
her
lips
on
a
pink
paper
streamer:--
the
jungfrau
to
beth
god
bless
you
dear
queen
bess
may
nothing
you
dismay
but
health
and
peace
and
happiness
be
yours
this
christmas
day
here's
fruit
to
feed
our
busy
bee
and
flowers
for
her
nose
here's
music

her

her
toes

laughed
when
she
saw
it
how
laurie
ran
up
and
down
to
bring
in
the
gifts
and
what
ridiculous
speeches
jo
made
as
she
presented
them
i'm
so
full
of
happiness
that
if
father
was
only
here
i
couldn't
hold
one
drop
more
said
beth
quite
sighing
with
contentment
as
jo
carried
her
off
to
the
study
to
rest
after
the
excitement
and
to
refresh
herself
with
some
of
the
delicious
grapes
the
jungfrau
had
sent
her

over

engraved
copy
of
the
madonna
and

her
mother
had
given
her
in
a
pretty
frame
of
course

the
silvery
folds
of
her
first
silk
dress
for
mr
laurence
had
insisted
on
giving
it
how
can
_i_
be
otherwise
said
mrs
march
gratefully
as
her
eyes
went
from
her
husband's
letter
to
beth's
smiling
face
and
her
hand
caressed
the
brooch
made
of
gray
and
golden
chestnut
and
dark
brown
hair
which
the
girls
had
just
fastened
on
her
breast
now
and
then
in
this
work-a-day
world
things
do
happen
in
the
delightful
story-book
fashion
and
what
a
comfort
that
is
half
an
hour
after
every
one
had
said
they
were
so
happy
they
could
only
hold
one
drop
more
the
drop
came
laurie
opened
the
parlor
door
and
popped
his
head
in
very
quietly
he
might
just
as
well
have
turned
a
somersault
and
uttered
an
indian
war-whoop
for
his
face
was
so
full
of
suppressed
excitement
and
his
voice
so
treacherously
joyful
that
every
one
jumped
up
though
he
only
said
in
a
queer
breathless
voice
here's
another
christmas
present
for
the
march
family
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth
he
was
whisked
away
somehow
and
in
his
place
appeared
a
tall
man
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
leaning
on
the
arm
of
another
tall
man
who
tried
to
say
something
and
couldn't
of
course
there
was
a
general
stampede
and
for
several
minutes
everybody
seemed
to
lose
their
wits
for
the
strangest
things
were
done
and
no
one
said
a
word
mr
march
became
invisible
in
the
embrace
of
four
pairs
of
loving
arms
jo
disgraced
herself
by
nearly
fainting
away
and
had
to
be
doctored
by
laurie
in
the
china-closet
mr
brooke
kissed
meg
entirely
by
mistake
as
he
somewhat
incoherently
explained
and
amy
the
dignified
tumbled
over
a
stool
and
never
stopping
to
get
up
hugged
and
cried
over
her
father's
boots
in
the
most
touching
manner
mrs
march
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
and
held
up
her
hand
with
a
warning
hush
remember
beth
but
it
was
too
late
the
study
door
flew
open
the
little
red
wrapper
appeared
on
the
threshold,--joy
put
strength
into
the
feeble
limbs,--and
beth
ran
straight
into
her
father's
arms
never
mind
what
happened
just
after
that
for
the
full
hearts
overflowed
washing
away
the
bitterness
of
the
past
and
leaving
only
the
sweetness
of
the
present
it
was
not
at
all
romantic
but
a
hearty
laugh
set
everybody
straight
again
for
hannah
was
discovered
behind
the
door
sobbing
over
the
fat
turkey
which
she
had
forgotten
to
put
down
when
she
rushed
up
from
the
kitchen
as
the
laugh
subsided
mrs
march
began
to
thank
mr
brooke
for
his
faithful
care
of
her
husband
at
which
mr
brooke
suddenly
remembered
that
mr
march
needed
rest
and
seizing
laurie
he
precipitately
retired
then
the
two
invalids
were
ordered
to
repose
which
they
did
by
both
sitting
in
one
big
chair
and
talking
hard
mr
march
told
how
he
had
longed
to
surprise
them
and
how
when
the
fine
weather
came
he
had
been
allowed
by
his
doctor
to
take
advantage
of
it
how
devoted
brooke
had
been
and
how
he
was
altogether
a
most
estimable
and
upright
young
man
why
mr
march
paused
a
minute
just
there
and
after
a
glance
at
meg
who
was
violently
poking
the
fire
looked
at
his
wife
with
an
inquiring
lift
of
the
eyebrows
i
leave
you
to
imagine
also
why
mrs
march
gently
nodded
her
head
and
asked
rather
abruptly
if
he
wouldn't
have
something
to
eat
jo
saw
and
understood
the
look
and
she
stalked
grimly
away
to
get
wine
and
beef-tea
muttering
to
herself
as
she
slammed
the
door
i
hate
estimable
young
men
with
brown
eyes
there
never
_was_
such
a
christmas
dinner
as
they
had
that
day
the
fat
turkey
was
a
sight
to
behold
when
hannah
sent
him
up
stuffed
browned
and
decorated
so
was
the
plum-pudding
which
quite
melted
in
one's
mouth
likewise
the
jellies
in
which
amy
revelled
like
a
fly
in
a
honey-pot
everything
turned
out
well
which
was
a
mercy
hannah
said
for
my
mind
was
that
flustered
mum
that
it's
a
merrycle
i
didn't
roast
the
pudding
and
stuff
the
turkey
with
raisins
let
alone
bilin'
of
it
in
a
cloth
mr
laurence
and
his
grandson
dined
with
them
also
mr
brooke,--at
whom
jo
glowered
darkly
to
laurie's
infinite
amusement
two
easy-chairs
stood
side
by
side
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
which
sat
beth
and
her
father
feasting
modestly
on
chicken
and
a
little
fruit
they
drank
healths
told
stories
sung
songs
reminisced
as
the
old
folks
say
and
had
a
thoroughly
good
time
a
sleigh-ride
had
been
planned
but
the
girls
would
not
leave
their
father
so
the
guests
departed
early
and
as
twilight
gathered
the
happy
family
sat
together
round
the
fire
just
a
year
ago
we
were
groaning
over
the
dismal
christmas
we
expected
to
have
do
you
remember
asked
jo
breaking
a
short
pause
which
had
followed
a
long
conversation
about
many
things
rather
a
pleasant
year
on
the
whole
said
meg
smiling
at
the
fire
and
congratulating
herself
on
having
treated
mr
brooke
with
dignity
i
think
it's
been
a
pretty
hard
one
observed
amy
watching
the
light
shine
on
her
ring
with
thoughtful
eyes
i'm
glad
it's
over
because
we've
got
you
back
whispered
beth
who
sat
on
her
father's
knee
rather
a
rough
road
for
you
to
travel
my
little
pilgrims
especially
the
latter
part
of
it
but
you
have
got
on
bravely
and
i
think
the
burdens
are
in
a
fair
way
to
tumble
off
very
soon
said
mr
march
looking
with
fatherly
satisfaction
at
the
four
young
faces
gathered
round
him
how
do
you
know
did
mother
tell
you
asked
jo
not
much
straws
show
which
way
the
wind
blows
and
i've
made
several
discoveries
to-day
oh
tell
us
what
they
are
cried
meg
who
sat
beside
him
here
is
one
and
taking
up
the
hand
which
lay
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
he
pointed
to
the
roughened
forefinger
a
burn
on
the
back
and
two
or
three
little
hard
spots
on
the
palm
i
remember
a
time
when
this
hand
was
white
and
smooth
and
your
first
care
was
to
keep
it
so
it
was
very
pretty
then
but
to
me
it
is
much
prettier
now,--for
in
these
seeming
blemishes
i
read
a
little
history
a
burnt-offering
has
been
made
of
vanity
this
hardened
palm
has
earned
something
better
than
blisters
and
i'm
sure
the
sewing
done
by
these
pricked
fingers
will
last
a
long
time
so
much
good-will
went
into
the
stitches
meg
my
dear
i
value
the
womanly
skill
which
keeps
home
happy
more
than
white
hands
or
fashionable
accomplishments
i'm
proud
to
shake
this
good
industrious
little
hand
and
hope
i
shall
not
soon
be
asked
to
give
it
away
if
meg
had
wanted
a
reward
for
hours
of
patient
labor
she
received
it
in
the
hearty
pressure
of
her
father's
hand
and
the
approving
smile
he
gave
her
what
about
jo
please
say
something
nice
for
she
has
tried
so
hard
and
been
so
very
very
good
to
me
said
beth
in
her
father's
ear
he
laughed
and
looked
across
at
the
tall
girl
who
sat
opposite
with
an
unusually
mild
expression
in
her
brown
face
in
spite
of
the
curly
crop
i
don't
see
the
'son
jo'
whom
i
left
a
year
ago
said
mr
march
i
see
a
young
lady
who
pins
her
collar
straight
laces
her
boots
neatly
and
neither
whistles
talks
slang
nor
lies
on
the
rug
as
she
used
to
do
her
face
is
rather
thin
and
pale
just
now
with
watching
and
anxiety
but
i
like
to
look
at
it
for
it
has
grown
gentler
and
her
voice
is
lower
she
doesn't
bounce
but
moves
quietly
and
takes
care
of
a
certain
little
person
in
a
motherly
way
which
delights
me
i
rather
miss
my
wild
girl
but
if
i
get
a
strong
helpful
tender-hearted
woman
in
her
place
i
shall
feel
quite
satisfied
i
don't
know
whether
the
shearing
sobered
our
black
sheep
but
i
do
know
that
in
all
washington
i
couldn't
find
anything
beautiful
enough
to
be
bought
with
the
five-and-twenty
dollars
which
my
good
girl
sent
me
jo's
keen
eyes
were
rather
dim
for
a
minute
and
her
thin
face
grew
rosy
in
the
firelight
as
she
received
her
father's
praise
feeling
that
she
did
deserve
a
portion
of
it
now
beth
said
amy
longing
for
her
turn
but
ready
to
wait
there's
so
little
of
her
i'm
afraid
to
say
much
for
fear
she
will
slip
away
altogether
though
she
is
not
so
shy
as
she
used
to
be
began
their
father
cheerfully
but
recollecting
how
nearly
he
_had_
lost
her
he
held
her
close
saying
tenderly
with
her
cheek
against
his
own
i've
got
you
safe
my
beth
and
i'll
keep
you
so
please
god
after
a
minute's
silence
he
looked
down
at
amy
who
sat
on
the
cricket
at
his
feet
and
said
with
a
caress
of
the
shining
hair,--
i
observed
that
amy
took
drumsticks
at
dinner
ran
errands
for
her
mother
all
the
afternoon
gave
meg
her
place
to-night
and
has
waited
on
every
one
with
patience
and
good-humor
i
also
observe
that
she
does
not
fret
much
nor
look
in
the
glass
and
has
not
even
mentioned
a
very
pretty
ring
which
she
wears
so
i
conclude
that
she
has
learned
to
think
of
other
people
more
and
of
herself
less
and
has
decided
to
try
and
mould
her
character
as
carefully
as
she
moulds
her
little
clay
figures
i
am
glad
of
this
for
though
i
should
be
very
proud
of
a
graceful
statue
made
by
her
i
shall
be
infinitely
prouder
of
a
lovable
daughter
with
a
talent
for
making
life
beautiful
to
herself
and
others
what
are
you
thinking
of
beth
asked
jo
when
amy
had
thanked
her
father
and
told
about
her
ring
i
read
in
'pilgrim's
progress'
to-day
how
after
many
troubles
christian
and
hopeful
came
to
a
pleasant
green
meadow
where
lilies
bloomed
all
the
year
round
and
there
they
rested
happily
as
we
do
now
before
they
went
on
to
their
journey's
end
answered
beth
adding
as
she
slipped
out
of
her
father's
arms
and
went
slowly
to
the
instrument
it's
singing
time
now
and
i
want
to
be
in
my
old
place
i'll
try
to
sing
the
song
of
the
shepherd-boy
which
the
pilgrims
heard
i
made
the
music
for
father
because
he
likes
the
verses
so
sitting
at
the
dear
little
piano
beth
softly
touched
the
keys
and
in
the
sweet
voice
they
had
never
thought
to
hear
again
sung
to
her
own
accompaniment
the
quaint
hymn
which
was
a
singularly
fitting
song
for
her:--
he
that
is
down
need
fear
no
fall
he
that
is
low
no
pride
he
that
is
humble
ever
shall
have
god
to
be
his
guide
i
am
content
with
what
i
have
little
be
it
or
much
and
lord
contentment
still
i
crave
because
thou
savest
such
fulness
to
them
a
burden
is
that
go
on
pilgrimage
here
little
and
hereafter
bliss
is
best
from
age
to
age

laurie
went
by
in
the
afternoon
and
seeing
meg
at
the
window
seemed
suddenly
possessed
with
a
melodramatic
fit
for
he
fell
down
upon
one
knee
in
the
snow
beat
his
breast
tore
his
hair
and
clasped
his
hands
imploringly
as
if
begging
some
boon
and
when
meg
told
him
to
behave
himself
and
go
away
he
wrung
imaginary
tears
out
of
his
handkerchief
and
staggered
round
the
corner
as
if
in
utter
despair
what
does
the
goose
mean
said
meg
laughing
and
trying
to
look
unconscious
he's
showing
you
how
your
john
will
go
on
by
and
by
touching
isn't
it
answered
jo
scornfully
don't
say
_my
john_
it
isn't
proper
or
true
but
meg's
voice
lingered
over
the
words
as
if
they
sounded
pleasant
to
her
please
don't
plague
me
jo
i've
told
you
i
don't
care
_much_
about
him
and
there
isn't
to
be
anything
said
but
we
are
all
to
be
friendly
and
go
on
as
before
we
can't
for
something
_has_
been
said
and
laurie's
mischief
has
spoilt
you
for
me
i
see
it
and
so
does
mother
you
are
not
like
your
old
self
a
bit
and
seem
ever
so
far
away
from
me
i
don't
mean
to
plague
you
and
will
bear
it
like
a
man
but
i
do
wish
it
was
all
settled
i
hate
to
wait
so
if
you
mean
ever
to
do
it
make
haste
and
have
it
over
quickly
said
jo
pettishly
_i_
can't
say
or
do
anything
till
he
speaks
and
he
won't
because
father
said
i
was
too
young
began
meg
bending
over
her
work
with
a
queer
little
smile
which
suggested
that
she
did
not
quite
agree
with
her
father
on
that
point
if
he
did
speak
you
wouldn't
know
what
to
say
but
would
cry
or
blush
or
let
him
have
his
own
way
instead
of
giving
a
good
decided
no
i'm
not
so
silly
and
weak
as
you
think
i
know
just
what
i
should
say
for
i've
planned
it
all
so
i
needn't
be
taken
unawares
there's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
and
i
wished
to
be
prepared
jo
couldn't
help
smiling
at
the
important
air
which
meg
had
unconsciously
assumed
and
which
was
as
becoming
as
the
pretty
color
varying
in
her
cheeks
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you'd
say
asked
jo
more
respectfully
not
at
all
you
are
sixteen
now
quite
old
enough
to
be
my
confidant
and
my
experience
will
be
useful
to
you
by
and
by
perhaps
in
your
own
affairs
of
this
sort
don't
mean
to
have
any
it's
fun
to
watch
other
people
philander
but
i
should
feel
like
a
fool
doing
it
myself
said
jo
looking
alarmed
at
the
thought
i
think
not
if
you
liked
any
one
very
much
and
he
liked
you
meg
spoke
as
if
to
herself
and
glanced
out
at
the
lane
where
she
had
often
seen
lovers
walking
together
in
the
summer
twilight
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
your
speech
to
that
man
said
jo
rudely
shortening
her
sister's
little
reverie
oh
i
should
merely
say
quite
calmly
and
decidedly
'thank
you
mr
brooke
you
are
very
kind
but
i
agree
with
father
that
i
am
too
young
to
enter
into
any
engagement
at
present
so
please
say
no
more
but
let
us
be
friends
as
we
were.'
hum
that's
stiff
and
cool
enough
i
don't
believe
you'll
ever
say
it
and
i
know
he
won't
be
satisfied
if
you
do
if
he
goes
on
like
the
rejected
lovers
in
books
you'll
give
in
rather
than
hurt
his
feelings
no
i
won't
i
shall
tell
him
i've
made
up
my
mind
and
shall
walk
out
of
the
room
with
dignity
meg
rose
as
she
spoke
and
was
just
going
to
rehearse
the
dignified
exit
when
a
step
in
the
hall
made
her
fly
into
her
seat
and
begin
to
sew
as
if
her
life
depended
on
finishing
that
particular
seam
in
a
given
time
jo
smothered
a
laugh
at
the
sudden
change
and
when
some
one
gave
a
modest
tap
opened
the
door
with
a
grim
aspect
which
was
anything
but
hospitable
good
afternoon
i
came
to
get
my
umbrella,--that
is
to
see
how
your
father
finds
himself
to-day
said
mr
brooke
getting
a
trifle
confused
as
his
eye
went
from
one
tell-tale
face
to
the
other
it's
very
well
he's
in
the
rack
i'll
get
him
and
tell
it
you
are
here
and
having
jumbled
her
father
and
the
umbrella
well
together
in
her
reply
jo
slipped
out
of
the
room
to
give
meg
a
chance
to
make
her
speech
and
air
her
dignity
but
the
instant
she
vanished
meg
began
to
sidle
towards
the
door
murmuring,--
mother
will
like
to
see
you
pray
sit
down
i'll
call
her
don't
go
are
you
afraid
of
me
margaret
and
mr
brooke
looked
so
hurt
that
meg
thought
she
must
have
done
something
very
rude
she
blushed
up
to
the
little
curls
on
her
forehead
for
he
had
never
called
her
margaret
before
and
she
was
surprised
to
find
how
natural
and
sweet
it
seemed
to
hear
him
say
it
anxious
to
appear
friendly
and
at
her
ease
she
put
out
her
hand
with
a
confiding
gesture
and
said
gratefully,--
how
can
i
be
afraid
when
you
have
been
so
kind
to
father
i
only
wish
i
could
thank
you
for
it
illustration
shall
i
tell
you
how
shall
i
tell
you
how
asked
mr
brooke
holding
the
small
hand
fast
in
both
his
own
and
looking
down
at
meg
with
so
much
love
in
the
brown
eyes
that
her
heart
began
to
flutter
and
she
both
longed
to
run
away
and
to
stop
and
listen
oh
no
please
don't--i'd
rather
not
she
said
trying
to
withdraw
her
hand
and
looking
frightened
in
spite
of
her
denial
i
won't
trouble
you
i
only
want
to
know
if
you
care
for
me
a
little
meg
i
love
you
so
much
dear
added
mr
brooke
tenderly
this
was
the
moment
for
the
calm
proper
speech
but
meg
didn't
make
it
she
forgot
every
word
of
it
hung
her
head
and
answered
i
don't
know
so
softly
that
john
had
to
stoop
down
to
catch
the
foolish
little
reply
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
worth
the
trouble
for
he
smiled
to
himself
as
if
quite
satisfied
pressed
the
plump
hand
gratefully
and
said
in
his
most
persuasive
tone
will
you
try
and
find
out
i
want
to
know
_so_
much
for
i
can't
go
to
work
with
any
heart
until
i
learn
whether
i
am
to
have
my
reward
in
the
end
or
not
i'm
too
young
faltered
meg
wondering
why
she
was
so
fluttered
yet
rather
enjoying
it
i'll
wait
and
in
the
meantime
you
could
be
learning
to
like
me
would
it
be
a
very
hard
lesson
dear
not
if
i
chose
to
learn
it
but--
please
choose
to
learn
meg
i
love
to
teach
and
this
is
easier
than
german
broke
in
john
getting
possession
of
the
other
hand
so
that
she
had
no
way
of
hiding
her
face
as
he
bent
to
look
into
it
his
tone
was
properly
beseeching
but
stealing
a
shy
look
at
him
meg
saw
that
his
eyes
were
merry
as
well
as
tender
and
that
he
wore
the
satisfied
smile
of
one
who
had
no
doubt
of
his
success
this
nettled
her
annie
moffat's
foolish
lessons
in
coquetry
came
into
her
mind
and
the
love
of
power
which
sleeps
in
the
bosoms
of
the
best
of
little
women
woke
up
all
of
a
sudden
and
took
possession
of
her
she
felt
excited
and
strange
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
followed
a
capricious
impulse
and
withdrawing
her
hands
said
petulantly
i
_don't_
choose
please
go
away
and
let
me
be
poor
mr
brooke
looked
as
if
his
lovely
castle
in
the
air
was
tumbling
about
his
ears
for
he
had
never
seen
meg
in
such
a
mood
before
and
it
rather
bewildered
him
do
you
really
mean
that
he
asked
anxiously
following
her
as
she
walked
away
yes
i
do
i
don't
want
to
be
worried
about
such
things
father
says
i
needn't
it's
too
soon
and
i'd
rather
not
mayn't
i
hope
you'll
change
your
mind
by
and
by
i'll
wait
and
say
nothing
till
you
have
had
more
time
don't
play
with
me
meg
i
didn't
think
that
of
you
don't
think
of
me
at
all
i'd
rather
you
wouldn't
said
meg
taking
a
naughty
satisfaction
in
trying
her
lover's
patience
and
her
own
power
he
was
grave
and
pale
now
and
looked
decidedly
more
like
the
novel
heroes
whom
she
admired
but
he
neither
slapped
his
forehead
nor
tramped
about
the
room
as
they
did
he
just
stood
looking
at
her
so
wistfully
so
tenderly
that
she
found
her
heart
relenting
in
spite
of
her
what
would
have
happened
next
i
cannot
say
if
aunt
march
had
not
come
hobbling
in
at
this
interesting
minute
the
old
lady
couldn't
resist
her
longing
to
see
her
nephew
for
she
had
met
laurie
as
she
took
her
airing
and
hearing
of
mr
march's
arrival
drove
straight
out
to
see
him
the
family
were
all
busy
in
the
back
part
of
the
house
and
she
had
made
her
way
quietly
in
hoping
to
surprise
them
she
did
surprise
two
of
them
so
much
that
meg
started
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
and
mr
brooke
vanished
into
the
study
bless
me
what's
all
this
cried
the
old
lady
with
a
rap
of
her
cane
as
she
glanced
from
the
pale
young
gentleman
to
the
scarlet
young
lady
illustration
bless
me
what's
all
this
it's
father's
friend
i'm
_so_
surprised
to
see
you
stammered
meg
feeling
that
she
was
in
for
a
lecture
now
that's
evident
returned
aunt
march
sitting
down
but
what
is
father's
friend
saying
to
make
you
look
like
a
peony
there's
mischief
going
on
and
i
insist
upon
knowing
what
it
is
with
another
rap
we
were
merely
talking
mr
brooke
came
for
his
umbrella
began
meg
wishing
that
mr
brooke
and
the
umbrella
were
safely
out
of
the
house
brooke
that
boy's
tutor
ah
i
understand
now
i
know
all
about
it
jo
blundered
into
a
wrong
message
in
one
of
your
father's
letters
and
i
made
her
tell
me
you
haven't
gone
and
accepted
him
child
cried
aunt
march
looking
scandalized
hush
he'll
hear
sha'n't
i
call
mother
said
meg
much
troubled
not
yet
i've
something
to
say
to
you
and
i
must
free
my
mind
at
once
tell
me
do
you
mean
to
marry
this
cook
if
you
do
not
one
penny
of
my
money
ever
goes
to
you
remember
that
and
be
a
sensible
girl
said
the
old
lady
impressively
now
aunt
march
possessed
in
perfection
the
art
of
rousing
the
spirit
of
opposition
in
the
gentlest
people
and
enjoyed
doing
it
the
best
of
us
have
a
spice
of
perversity
in
us
especially
when
we
are
young
and
in
love
if
aunt
march
had
begged
meg
to
accept
john
brooke
she
would
probably
have
declared
she
couldn't
think
of
it
but
as
she
was
peremptorily
ordered
_not_
to
like
him
she
immediately
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
inclination
as
well
as
perversity
made
the
decision
easy
and
being
already
much
excited
meg
opposed
the
old
lady
with
unusual
spirit
i
shall
marry
whom
i
please
aunt
march
and
you
can
leave
your
money
to
any
one
you
like
she
said
nodding
her
head
with
a
resolute
air
highty
tighty
is
that
the
way
you
take
my
advice
miss
you'll
be
sorry
for
it
by
and
by
when
you've
tried
love
in
a
cottage
and
found
it
a
failure
it
can't
be
a
worse
one
than
some
people
find
in
big
houses
retorted
meg
aunt
march
put
on
her
glasses
and
took
a
look
at
the
girl
for
she
did
not
know
her
in
this
new
mood
meg
hardly
knew
herself
she
felt
so
brave
and
independent,--so
glad
to
defend
john
and
assert
her
right
to
love
him
if
she
liked
aunt
march
saw
that
she
had
begun
wrong
and
after
a
little
pause
made
a
fresh
start
saying
as
mildly
as
she
could
now
meg
my
dear
be
reasonable
and
take
my
advice
i
mean
it
kindly
and
don't
want
you
to
spoil
your
whole
life
by
making
a
mistake
at
the
beginning
you
ought
to
marry
well
and
help
your
family
it's
your
duty
to
make
a
rich
match
and
it
ought
to
be
impressed
upon
you
father
and
mother
don't
think
so
they
like
john
though
he
_is_
poor
your
parents
my
dear
have
no
more
worldly
wisdom
than
two
babies
i'm
glad
of
it
cried
meg
stoutly
aunt
march
took
no
notice
but
went
on
with
her
lecture
this
rook
is
poor
and
hasn't
got
any
rich
relations
has
he
no
but
he
has
many
warm
friends
you
can't
live
on
friends
try
it
and
see
how
cool
they'll
grow
he
hasn't
any
business
has
he
not
yet
mr
laurence
is
going
to
help
him
that
won't
last
long
james
laurence
is
a
crotchety
old
fellow
and
not
to
be
depended
on
so
you
intend
to
marry
a
man
without
money
position
or
business
and
go
on
working
harder
than
you
do
now
when
you
might
be
comfortable
all
your
days
by
minding
me
and
doing
better
i
thought
you
had
more
sense
meg
i
couldn't
do
better
if
i
waited
half
my
life
john
is
good
and
wise
he's
got
heaps
of
talent
he's
willing
to
work
and
sure
to
get
on
he's
so
energetic
and
brave
every
one
likes
and
respects
him
and
i'm
proud
to
think
he
cares
for
me
though
i'm
so
poor
and
young
and
silly
said
meg
looking
prettier
than
ever
in
her
earnestness
he
knows
_you_
have
got
rich
relations
child
that's
the
secret
of
his
liking
i
suspect
aunt
march
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
john
is
above
such
meanness
and
i
won't
listen
to
you
a
minute
if
you
talk
so
cried
meg
indignantly
forgetting
everything
but
the
injustice
of
the
old
lady's
suspicions
my
john
wouldn't
marry
for
money
anymore
than
i
would
we
are
willing
to
work
and
we
mean
to
wait
i'm
not
afraid
of
being
poor
for
i've
been
happy
so
far
and
i
know
i
shall
be
with
him
because
he
loves
me
and
i--
meg
stopped
there
remembering
all
of
a
sudden
that
she
hadn't
made
up
her
mind
that
she
had
told
her
john
to
go
away
and
that
he
might
be
overhearing
her
inconsistent
remarks
aunt
march
was
very
angry
for
she
had
set
her
heart
on
having
her
pretty
niece
make
a
fine
match
and
something
in
the
girl's
happy
young
face
made
the
lonely
old
woman
feel
both
sad
and
sour
well
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
affair
you
are
a
wilful
child
and
you've
lost
more
than
you
know
by
this
piece
of
folly
no
i
won't
stop
i'm
disappointed
in
you
and
haven't
spirits
to
see
your
father
now
don't
expect
anything
from
me
when
you
are
married
your
mr
book's
friends
must
take
care
of
you
i'm
done
with
you
forever
and
slamming
the
door
in
meg's
face
aunt
march
drove
off
in
high
dudgeon
she
seemed
to
take
all
the
girl's
courage
with
her
for
when
left
alone
meg
stood
a
moment
undecided
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
she
was
taken
possession
of
by
mr
brooke
who
said
all
in
one
breath
i
couldn't
help
hearing
meg
thank
you
for
defending
me
and
aunt
march
for
proving
that
you
_do_
care
for
me
a
little
bit
i
didn't
know
how
much
till
she
abused
you
began
meg
and
i
needn't
go
away
but
may
stay
and
be
happy
may
i
dear
here
was
another
fine
chance
to
make
the
crushing
speech
and
the
stately
exit
but
meg
never
thought
of
doing
either
and
disgraced
herself
forever
in
jo's
eyes
by
meekly
whispering
yes
john
and
hiding
her
face
on
mr
brooke's
waistcoat
fifteen
minutes
after
aunt
march's
departure
jo
came
softly
down
stairs
paused
an
instant
at
the
parlor
door
and
hearing
no
sound
within
nodded
and
smiled
with
a
satisfied
expression
saying
to
herself
she
has
sent
him
away
as
we
planned
and
that
affair
is
settled
i'll
go
and
hear
the
fun
and
have
a
good
laugh
over
it
but
poor
jo
never
got
her
laugh
for
she
was
transfixed
upon
the
threshold
by
a
spectacle
which
held
her
there
staring
with
her
mouth
nearly
as
wide
open
as
her
eyes
going
in
to
exult
over
a
fallen
enemy
and
to
praise
a
strong-minded
sister
for
the
banishment
of
an
objectionable
lover
it
certainly
_was_
a
shock
to
behold
the
aforesaid
enemy
serenely
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
strong-minded
sister
enthroned
upon
his
knee
and
wearing
an
expression
of
the
most
abject
submission
jo
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
as
if
a
cold
shower-bath
had
suddenly
fallen
upon
her,--for
such
an
unexpected
turning
of
the
tables
actually
took
her
breath
away
at
the
odd
sound
the
lovers
turned
and
saw
her
meg
jumped
up
looking
both
proud
and
shy
but
that
man
as
jo
called
him
actually
laughed
and
said
coolly
as
he
kissed
the
astonished
new-comer
sister
jo
congratulate
us
that
was
adding
insult
to
injury,--it
was
altogether
too
much,--and
making
some
wild
demonstration
with
her
hands
jo
vanished
without
a
word
rushing
upstairs
she
startled
the
invalids
by
exclaiming
tragically
as
she
burst
into
the
room
oh
_do_
somebody
go
down
quick
john
brooke
is
acting
dreadfully
and
meg
likes
it
mr
and
mrs
march
left
the
room
with
speed
and
casting
herself
upon
the
bed
jo
cried
and
scolded
tempestuously
as
she
told
the
awful
news
to
beth
and
amy
the
little
girls
however
considered
it
a
most
agreeable
and
interesting
event
and
jo
got
little
comfort
from
them
so
she
went
up
to
her
refuge
in
the
garret
and
confided
her
troubles
to
the
rats
nobody
ever
knew
what
went
on
in
the
parlor
that
afternoon
but
a
great
deal
of
talking
was
done
and
quiet
mr
brooke
astonished
his
friends
by
the
eloquence
and
spirit
with
which
he
pleaded
his
suit
told
his
plans
and
persuaded
them
to
arrange
everything
just
as
he
wanted
it
the
tea-bell
rang
before
he
had
finished
describing
the
paradise
which
he
meant
to
earn
for
meg
and
he
proudly
took
her
in
to
supper
both
looking
so
happy
that
jo
hadn't
the
heart
to
be
jealous
or
dismal
amy
was
very
much
impressed
by
john's
devotion
and
meg's
dignity
beth
beamed
at
them
from
a
distance
while
mr
and
mrs
march
surveyed
the
young
couple
with
such
tender
satisfaction
that
it
was
perfectly
evident
aunt
march
was
right
in
calling
them
as
unworldly
as
a
pair
of
babies
no
one
ate
much
but
every
one
looked
very
happy
and
the
old
room
seemed
to
brighten
up
amazingly
when
the
first
romance
of
the
family
began
there
you
can't
say
nothing
pleasant
ever
happens
now
can
you
meg
said
amy
trying
to
decide
how
she
would
group
the
lovers
in
the
sketch
she
was
planning
to
take
no
i'm
sure
i
can't
how
much
has
happened
since
i
said
that
it
seems
a
year
ago
answered
meg
who
was
in
a
blissful
dream
lifted
far
above
such
common
things
as
bread
and
butter
the
joys
come
close
upon
the
sorrows
this
time
and
i
rather
think
the
changes
have
begun
said
mrs
march
in
most
families
there
comes
now
and
then
a
year
full
of
events
this
has
been
such
an
one
but
it
ends
well
after
all
hope
the
next
will
end
better
muttered
jo
who
found
it
very
hard
to
see
meg
absorbed
in
a
stranger
before
her
face
for
jo
loved
a
few
persons
very
dearly
and
dreaded
to
have
their
affection
lost
or
lessened
in
any
way
i
hope
the
third
year
from
this
_will_
end
better
i
mean
it
shall
if
i
live
to
work
out
my
plans
said
mr
brooke
smiling
at
meg
as
if
everything
had
become
possible
to
him
now
doesn't
it
seem
very
long
to
wait
asked
amy
who
was
in
a
hurry
for
the
wedding
i've
got
so
much
to
learn
before
i
shall
be
ready
it
seems
a
short
time
to
me
answered
meg
with
a
sweet
gravity
in
her
face
never
seen
there
before
you
have
only
to
wait
_i_
am
to
do
the
work
said
john
beginning
his
labors
by
picking
up
meg's
napkin
with
an
expression
which
caused
jo
to
shake
her
head
and
then
say
to
herself
with
an
air
of
relief
as
the
front
door
banged
here
comes
laurie
now
we
shall
have
a
little
sensible
conversation
but
jo
was
mistaken
for
laurie
came
prancing
in
overflowing
with
spirits
bearing
a
great
bridal-looking
bouquet
for
mrs
john
brooke
and
evidently
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
brought
about
by
his
excellent
management
illustration
for
mrs
john
brooke
i
knew
brooke
would
have
it
all
his
own
way
he
always
does
for
when
he
makes
up
his
mind
to
accomplish
anything
it's
done
though
the
sky
falls
said
laurie
when
he
had
presented
his
offering
and
his
congratulations
much
obliged
for
that
recommendation
i
take
it
as
a
good
omen
for
the
future
and
invite
you
to
my
wedding
on
the
spot
answered
mr
brooke
who
felt
at
peace
with
all
mankind
even
his
mischievous
pupil
i'll
come
if
i'm
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
the
sight
of
jo's
face
alone
on
that
occasion
would
be
worth
a
long
journey
you
don't
look
festive
ma'am
what's
the
matter
asked
laurie
following
her
into
a
corner
of
the
parlor
whither
all
had
adjourned
to
greet
mr
laurence
i
don't
approve
of
the
match
but
i've
made
up
my
mind
to
bear
it
and
shall
not
say
a
word
against
it
said
jo
solemnly
you
can't
know
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
give
up
meg
she
continued
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
voice
you
don't
give
her
up
you
only
go
halves
said
laurie
consolingly
it
never
can
be
the
same
again
i've
lost
my
dearest
friend
sighed
jo
you've
got
me
anyhow
i'm
not
good
for
much
i
know
but
i'll
stand
by
you
jo
all
the
days
of
my
life
upon
my
word
i
will
and
laurie
meant
what
he
said
i
know
you
will
and
i'm
ever
so
much
obliged
you
are
always
a
great
comfort
to
me
teddy
returned
jo
gratefully
shaking
hands
well
now
don't
be
dismal
there's
a
good
fellow
it's
all
right
you
see
meg
is
happy
brooke
will
fly
round
and
get
settled
immediately
grandpa
will
attend
to
him
and
it
will
be
very
jolly
to
see
meg
in
her
own
little
house
we'll
have
capital
times
after
she
is
gone
for
i
shall
be
through
college
before
long
and
then
we'll
go
abroad
or
some
nice
trip
or
other
wouldn't
that
console
you
i
rather
think
it
would
but
there's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
in
three
years
said
jo
thoughtfully
that's
true
don't
you
wish
you
could
take
a
look
forward
and
see
where
we
shall
all
be
then
i
do
returned
laurie
i
think
not
for
i
might
see
something
sad
and
every
one
looks
so
happy
now
i
don't
believe
they
could
be
much
improved
and
jo's
eyes
went
slowly
round
the
room
brightening
as
they
looked
for
the
prospect
was
a
pleasant
one
father
and
mother
sat
together
quietly
re-living
the
first
chapter
of
the
romance
which
for
them
began
some
twenty
years
ago
amy
was
drawing
the
lovers
who
sat
apart
in
a
beautiful
world
of
their
own
the
light
of
which
touched
their
faces
with
a
grace
the
little
artist
could
not
copy
beth
lay
on
her
sofa
talking
cheerily
with
her
old
friend
who
held
her
little
hand
as
if
he
felt
that
it
possessed
the
power
to
lead
him
along
the
peaceful
way
she
walked
jo
lounged
in
her
favorite
low
seat
with
the
grave
quiet
look
which
best
became
her
and
laurie
leaning
on
the
back
of
her
chair
his
chin
on
a
level
with
her
curly
head
smiled
with
his
friendliest
aspect
and
nodded
at
her
in
the
long
glass
which
reflected
them
both
*

so
grouped
the
curtain
falls
upon
meg
jo
beth
and
amy
whether
it
ever
rises
again
depends
upon
the
reception
given
to
the
first
act
of
the
domestic
drama
called
little
women
illustration
home
of
the
little
women
the
second
part
illustration
the
dove
cote
xxiv
gossip
in
order
that
we
may
start
afresh
and
go
to
meg's
wedding
with
free
minds
it
will
be
well
to
begin
with
a
little
gossip
about
the
marches
and
here
let
me
premise
that
if
any
of
the
elders
think
there
is
too
much
lovering
in
the
story
as
i
fear
they
may
i'm
not
afraid
the
young
folks
will
make
that
objection
i
can
only
say
with
mrs
march
what
_can_
you
expect
when
i
have
four
gay
girls
in
the
house
and
a
dashing
young
neighbor
over
the
way
the
three
years
that
have
passed
have
brought
but
few
changes
to
the
quiet
family
the
war
is
over
and
mr
march
safely
at
home
busy
with
his
books
and
the
small
parish
which
found
in
him
a
minister
by
nature
as
by
grace,--a
quiet
studious
man
rich
in
the
wisdom
that
is
better
than
learning
the
charity
which
calls
all
mankind
brother
the
piety
that
blossoms
into
character
making
it
august
and
lovely
these
attributes
in
spite
of
poverty
and
the
strict
integrity
which
shut
him
out
from
the
more
worldly
successes
attracted
to
him
many
admirable
persons
as
naturally
as
sweet
herbs

bees
and
as
naturally
he
gave
them
the
honey
into
which
fifty
years
of
hard
experience
had
distilled
no
bitter
drop
earnest
young
men
found
the
gray-headed
scholar
as
young
at
heart
as
they
thoughtful
or
troubled
women
instinctively
brought
their
doubts
and
sorrows
to
him
sure
of
finding
the
gentlest
sympathy
the
wisest
counsel
sinners
told
their
sins
to
the
pure-hearted
old
man
and
were
both
rebuked
and
saved
gifted
men
found
a
companion
in
him
ambitious
men
caught
glimpses
of
nobler
ambitions
than
their
own
and
even
worldlings
confessed
that
his
beliefs
were
beautiful
and
true
although
they
wouldn't
pay
to
outsiders
the
five
energetic
women
seemed
to
rule
the
house
and
so
they
did
in
many
things
but
the
quiet
scholar
sitting
among
his
books
was
still
the
head
of
the
family
the
household
conscience
anchor
and
comforter
for
to
him
the
busy
anxious
women
always
turned
in
troublous
times
finding
him
in
the
truest
sense
of
those
sacred
words
husband
and
father
the
girls
gave
their
hearts
into
their
mother's
keeping
their
souls
into
their
father's
and
to
both
parents
who
lived
and
labored
so
faithfully
for
them
they
gave
a
love
that
grew
with
their
growth
and
bound
them
tenderly
together
by
the
sweetest
tie
which
blesses
life
and
outlives
death
mrs
march
is
as
brisk
and
cheery
though
rather
grayer
than
when
we
saw
her
last
and
just
now
so
absorbed
in
meg's
affairs
that
the
hospitals
and
homes
still
full
of
wounded
boys
and
soldiers'
widows
decidedly
miss
the
motherly
missionary's
visits
john
brooke
did
his
duty
manfully
for
a
year
got
wounded
was
sent
home
and
not
allowed
to
return
he
received
no
stars
or
bars
but
he
deserved
them
for
he
cheerfully
risked
all
he
had
and
life
and
love
are
very
precious
when
both
are
in
full
bloom
perfectly
resigned
to
his
discharge
he
devoted
himself
to
getting
well
preparing
for
business
and
earning
a
home
for
meg
with
the
good
sense
and
sturdy
independence
that
characterized
him
he
refused
mr
laurence's
more
generous
offers
and
accepted
the
place
of
book-keeper
feeling
better
satisfied
to
begin
with
an
honestly-earned
salary
than
by
running
any
risks
with
borrowed
money
meg
had
spent
the
time
in
working
as
well
as
waiting
growing
womanly
in
character
wise
in
housewifely
arts
and
prettier
than
ever
for
love
is
a
great
beautifier
she
had
her
girlish
ambitions
and
hopes
and
felt
some
disappointment
at
the
humble
way
in
which
the
new
life
must
begin
ned
moffat
had
just
married
sallie
gardiner
and
meg
couldn't
help
contrasting
their
fine
house
and
carriage
many
gifts
and
splendid
outfit
with
her
own
and
secretly
wishing
she
could
have
the
same
but
somehow
envy
and
discontent
soon
vanished
when
she
thought
of
all
the
patient
love
and
labor
john
had
put
into
the
little
home
awaiting
her
and
when
they
sat
together
in
the
twilight
talking
over
their
small
plans
the
future
always
grew
so
beautiful
and
bright
that
she
forgot
sallie's
splendor
and
felt
herself
the
richest
happiest
girl
in
christendom
jo
never
went
back
to
aunt
march
for
the
old
lady
took
such
a
fancy
to
amy
that
she
bribed
her
with
the
offer
of
drawing
lessons
from
one
of
the
best
teachers
going
and
for
the
sake
of
this
advantage
amy
would
have
served
a
far
harder
mistress
so
she
gave
her
mornings
to
duty
her
afternoons
to
pleasure
and
prospered
finely
jo
meantime
devoted
herself
to
literature
and
beth
who
remained
delicate
long
after
the
fever
was
a
thing
of
the
past
not
an
invalid
exactly
but
never
again
the
rosy
healthy
creature
she
had
been
yet
always
hopeful
happy
and
serene
busy
with
the
quiet
duties
she
loved
every
one's
friend
and
an
angel
in
the
house
long
before
those
who
loved
her
most
had
learned
to
know
it
as
long
as
the
spread
eagle
paid
her
a
dollar
a
column
for
her
rubbish
as
she
called
it
jo
felt
herself
a
woman
of
means
and
spun
her
little
romances
diligently
but
great
plans
fermented
in
her
busy
brain
and
ambitious
mind
and
the
old
tin
kitchen
in
the
garret
held
a
slowly
increasing
pile
of
blotted
manuscript
which
was
one
day
to
place
the
name
of
march
upon
the
roll
of
fame
laurie
having
dutifully
gone
to
college
to
please
his
grandfather
was
now
getting
through
it
in
the
easiest
possible
manner
to
please
himself
a
universal
favorite
thanks
to
money
manners
much
talent
and
the
kindest
heart
that
ever
got
its
owner
into
scrapes
by
trying
to
get
other
people
out
of
them
he
stood
in
great
danger
of
being
spoilt
and
probably
would
have
been
like
many
another
promising
boy
if
he
had
not
possessed
a
talisman
against
evil
in
the
memory
of
the
kind
old
man
who
was
bound
up
in
his
success
the
motherly
friend
who
watched
over
him
as
if
he
were
her
son
and
last
but
not
least
by
any
means
the
knowledge
that
four
innocent
girls
loved
admired
and
believed
in
him
with
all
their
hearts
being
only
a
glorious
human
boy
of
course
he
frolicked
and
flirted
grew
dandified
aquatic
sentimental
or
gymnastic
as
college
fashions
ordained
hazed
and
was
hazed
talked
slang
and
more
than
once
came
perilously
near
suspension
and
expulsion
but
as
high
spirits
and
the
love
of
fun
were
the
causes
of
these
pranks
he
always
managed
to
save
himself
by
frank
confession
honorable
atonement
or
the
irresistible
power
of
persuasion
which
he
possessed
in
perfection
in
fact
he
rather
prided
himself
on
his
narrow
escapes
and
liked
to
thrill
the
girls
with
graphic
accounts
of
his
triumphs
over
wrathful
tutors
dignified
professors
and
vanquished
enemies
the
men
of
my
class
were
heroes
in
the
eyes
of
the
girls
who
never
wearied
of
the
exploits
of
our
fellows
and
were
frequently
allowed
to
bask
in
the
smiles
of
these
great
creatures
when
laurie
brought
them
home
with
him
amy
especially
enjoyed
this
high
honor
and
became
quite
a
belle
among
them
for
her
ladyship
early
felt
and
learned
to
use
the
gift
of
fascination
with
which
she
was
endowed
meg
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
private
and
particular
john
to
care
for
any
other
lords
of
creation
and
beth
too
shy
to
do
more
than
peep
at
them
and
wonder
how
amy
dared
to
order
them
about
so
but
jo
felt
quite
in
her
element
and
found
it
very
difficult
to
refrain
from
imitating
the
gentlemanly
attitudes
phrases
and
feats
which
seemed
more
natural
to
her
than
the
decorums
prescribed
for
young
ladies
they
all
liked
jo
immensely
but
never
fell
in
love
with
her
though
very
few
escaped
without
paying
the
tribute
of
a
sentimental
sigh
or
two
at
amy's
shrine
and
speaking
of
sentiment
brings
us
very
naturally
to
the
dove-cote
that
was
the
name
of
the
little
brown
house
which
mr
brooke
had
prepared
for
meg's
first
home
laurie
had
christened
it
saying
it
was
highly
appropriate
to
the
gentle
lovers
who
went
on
together
like
a
pair
of
turtle-doves
with
first
a
bill
and
then
a
coo
it
was
a
tiny
house
with
a
little
garden
behind
and
a
lawn
about
as
big
as
a
pocket-handkerchief
in
front
here
meg
meant
to
have
a
fountain
shrubbery
and
a
profusion
of
lovely
flowers
though
just
at
present
the
fountain
was
represented
by
a
weather-beaten
urn
very
like
a
dilapidated
slop-bowl
the
shrubbery
consisted
of
several
young
larches
undecided
whether
to
live
or
die
and
the
profusion
of
flowers
was
merely
hinted
by
regiments
of
sticks
to
show
where
seeds
were
planted
but
inside
it
was
altogether
charming
and
the
happy
bride
saw
no
fault
from
garret
to
cellar
to
be
sure
the
hall
was
so
narrow
it
was
fortunate
that
they
had
no
piano
for
one
never
could
have
been
got
in
whole
the
dining-room
was
so
small
that
six
people
were
a
tight
fit
and
the
kitchen
stairs
seemed
built
for
the
express
purpose
of
precipitating
both
servants
and
china
pell-mell
into
the
coal-bin
but
once
get
used
to
these
slight
blemishes
and
nothing
could
be
more
complete
for
good
sense
and
good
taste
had
presided
over
the
furnishing
and
the
result
was
highly
satisfactory
there
were
no
marble-topped
tables
long
mirrors
or
lace
curtains
in
the
little
parlor
but
simple
furniture
plenty
of
books
a
fine
picture
or
two
a
stand
of
flowers
in
the
bay-window
and
scattered
all
about
the
pretty
gifts
which
came
from
friendly
hands
and
were
the
fairer
for
the
loving
messages
they
brought
i
don't
think
the
parian
psyche
laurie
gave
lost
any
of
its
beauty
because
john
put
up
the
bracket
it
stood
upon
that
any
upholsterer
could
have
draped
the
plain
muslin
curtains
more
gracefully
than
amy's
artistic
hand
or
that
any
store-room
was
ever
better
provided
with
good
wishes
merry
words
and
happy
hopes
than
that
in
which
jo
and
her
mother
put
away
meg's
few
boxes
barrels
and
bundles
and
i
am
morally
certain
that
the
spandy-new
kitchen
never
_could_
have
looked
so
cosey
and
neat
if
hannah
had
not
arranged
every
pot
and
pan
a
dozen
times
over
and
laid
the
fire
all
ready
for
lighting
the
minute
mis
brooke
came
home
i
also
doubt
if
any
young
matron
ever
began
life
with
so
rich
a
supply
of
dusters
holders
and
piece-bags
for
beth
made
enough
to
last
till
the
silver
wedding
came
round
and
invented
three
different
kinds
of
dishcloths
for
the
express
service
of
the
bridal
china
people
who
hire
all
these
things
done
for
them
never
know
what
they
lose
for
the
homeliest
tasks
get
beautified
if
loving
hands
do
them
and
meg
found
so
many
proofs
of
this
that
everything
in
her
small
nest
from
the
kitchen
roller
to
the
silver
vase
on
her
parlor
table
was
eloquent
of
home
love
and
tender
forethought
what
happy
times
they
had
planning
together
what
solemn
shopping
excursions
what
funny
mistakes
they
made
and
what
shouts
of
laughter
arose
over
laurie's
ridiculous
bargains
in
his
love
of
jokes
this
young
gentleman
though
nearly
through
college
was
as
much
of
a
boy
as
ever
his
last
whim
had
been
to
bring
with
him
on
his
weekly
visits
some
new
useful
and
ingenious
article
for
the
young
housekeeper
now
a
bag
of
remarkable
clothes-pins
next
a
wonderful
nutmeg-grater
which
fell
to
pieces
at
the
first
trial
a
knife-cleaner
that
spoilt
all
the
knives
or
a
sweeper
that
picked
the
nap
neatly
off
the
carpet
and
left
the
dirt
labor-saving
soap
that
took
the
skin
off
one's
hands
infallible
cements
which
stuck
firmly
to
nothing
but
the
fingers
of
the
deluded
buyer
and
every
kind
of
tin-ware
from
a
toy
savings-bank
for
odd
pennies
to
a
wonderful
boiler
which
would
wash
articles
in
its
own
steam
with
every
prospect
of
exploding
in
the
process
in
vain
meg
begged
him
to
stop
john
laughed
at
him
and
jo
called
him
mr
toodles
he
was
possessed
with
a
mania
for
patronizing
yankee
ingenuity
and
seeing
his
friends
fitly
furnished
forth
so
each
week
beheld
some
fresh
absurdity
everything
was
done
at
last
even
to
amy's
arranging
different
colored
soaps
to
match
the
different
colored
rooms
and
beth's
setting
the
table
for
the
first
meal
are
you
satisfied
does
it
seem
like
home
and
do
you
feel
as
if
you
should
be
happy
here
asked
mrs
march
as
she
and
her
daughter
went
through
the
new
kingdom
arm-in-arm
for
just
then
they
seemed
to
cling
together
more
tenderly
than
ever
yes
mother
perfectly
satisfied
thanks
to
you
all
and
_so_
happy
that
i
can't
talk
about
it
answered
meg
with
a
look
that
was
better
than
words
if
she
only
had
a
servant
or
two
it
would
be
all
right
said
amy
coming
out
of
the
parlor
where
she
had
been
trying
to
decide
whether
the
bronze
mercury
looked
best
on
the
whatnot
or
the
mantle-piece
mother
and
i
have
talked
that
over
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
try
her
way
first
there
will
be
so
little
to
do
that
with
lotty
to
run
my
errands
and
help
me
here
and
there
i
shall
only
have
enough
work
to
keep
me
from
getting
lazy
or
homesick
answered
meg
tranquilly
sallie
moffat
has
four
began
amy
if
meg
had
four
the
house
wouldn't
hold
them
and
master
and
missis
would
have
to
camp
in
the
garden
broke
in
jo
who
enveloped
in
a
big
blue
pinafore
was
giving
the
last
polish
to
the
door-handles
sallie
isn't
a
poor
man's
wife
and
many
maids
are
in
keeping
with
her
fine
establishment
meg
and
john
begin
humbly
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
there
will
be
quite
as
much
happiness
in
the
little
house
as
in
the
big
one
it's
a
great
mistake
for
young
girls
like
meg
to
leave
themselves
nothing
to
do
but
dress
give
orders
and
gossip
when
i
was
first
married
i
used
to
long
for
my
new
clothes
to
wear
out
or
get
torn
so
that
i
might
have
the
pleasure
of
mending
them
for
i
got
heartily
sick
of
doing
fancy
work
and
tending
my
pocket
handkerchief
why
didn't
you
go
into
the
kitchen
and
make
messes
as
sallie
says
she
does
to
amuse
herself
though
they
never
turn
out
well
and
the
servants
laugh
at
her
said
meg
i
did
after
a
while
not
to
'mess,'
but
to
learn
of
hannah
how
things
should
be
done
that
my
servants
need
_not_
laugh
at
me
it
was
play
then
but
there
came
a
time
when
i
was
truly
grateful
that
i
not
only
possessed
the
will
but
the
power
to
cook
wholesome
food
for
my
little
girls
and
help
myself
when
i
could
no
longer
afford
to
hire
help
you
begin
at
the
other
end
meg
dear
but
the
lessons
you
learn
now
will
be
of
use
to
you
by
and
by
when
john
is
a
richer
man
for
the
mistress
of
a
house
however
splendid
should
know
how
work
ought
to
be
done
if
she
wishes
to
be
well
and
honestly
served
yes
mother
i'm
sure
of
that
said
meg
listening
respectfully
to
the
little
lecture
for
the
best
of
women
will
hold
forth
upon
the
all-absorbing
subject
of
housekeeping
do
you
know
i
like
this
room
most
of
all
in
my
baby-house
added
meg
a
minute
after
as
they
went
upstairs
and
she
looked
into
her
well-stored
linen-closet
beth
was
there
laying
the
snowy
piles
smoothly
on
the
shelves
and
exulting
over
the
goodly
array
all
three
laughed
as
meg
spoke
for
that
linen-closet
was
a
joke
you
see
having
said
that
if
meg
married
that
brooke
she
shouldn't
have
a
cent
of
her
money
aunt
march
was
rather
in
a
quandary
when
time
had
appeased
her
wrath
and
made
her
repent
her
vow
she
never
broke
her
word
and
was
much
exercised
in
her
mind
how
to
get
round
it
and
at
last
devised
a
plan
whereby
she
could
satisfy
herself
mrs
carrol
florence's
mamma
was
ordered
to
buy
have
made
and
marked
a
generous
supply
of
house
and
table
linen
and
send
it
as
_her_
present
all
of
which
was
faithfully
done
but
the
secret
leaked
out
and
was
greatly
enjoyed
by
the
family
for
aunt
march
tried
to
look
utterly
unconscious
and
insisted
that
she
could
give
nothing
but
the
old-fashioned
pearls
long
promised
to
the
first
bride
that's
a
housewifely
taste
which
i
am
glad
to
see
i
had
a
young
friend
who
set
up
housekeeping
with
six
sheets
but
she
had
finger
bowls
for
company
and
that
satisfied
her
said
mrs
march
patting
the
damask
table-cloths
with
a
truly
feminine
appreciation
of
their
fineness
i
haven't
a
single
finger-bowl
but
this
is
a
'set
out'
that
will
last
me
all
my
days
hannah
says
and
meg
looked
quite
contented
as
well
she
might
toodles
is
coming
cried
jo
from
below
and
they
all
went
down
to
meet
laurie
whose
weekly
visit
was
an
important
event
in
their
quiet
lives
a
tall
broad-shouldered
young
fellow
with
a
cropped
head
a
felt-basin
of
a
hat
and
a
fly-away
coat
came
tramping
down
the
road
at
a
great
pace
walked
over
the
low
fence
without
stopping
to
open
the
gate
straight
up
to
mrs
march
with
both
hands
out
and
a
hearty--
here
i
am
mother
yes
it's
all
right
the
last
words
were
in
answer
to
the
look
the
elder
lady
gave
him
a
kindly
questioning
look
which
the
handsome
eyes
met
so
frankly
that
the
little
ceremony
closed
as
usual
with
a
motherly
kiss
for
mrs
john
brooke
with
the
maker's
congratulations
and
compliments
bless
you
beth
what
a
refreshing
spectacle
you
are
jo
amy
you
are
getting
altogether
too
handsome
for
a
single
lady
as
laurie
spoke
he
delivered
a
brown
paper
parcel
to
meg
pulled
beth's
hair-ribbon
stared
at
jo's
big
pinafore
and
fell
into
an
attitude
of
mock
rapture
before
amy
then
shook
hands
all
round
and
every
one
began
to
talk
where
is
john
asked
meg
anxiously
stopped
to
get
the
license
for
to-morrow
ma'am
which
side
won
the
last
match
teddy
inquired
jo
who
persisted
in
feeling
an
interest
in
manly
sports
despite
her
nineteen
years
ours
of
course
wish
you'd
been
there
to
see
how
is
the
lovely
miss
randal
asked
amy
with
a
significant
smile
more
cruel
than
ever
don't
you
see
how
i'm
pining
away
and
laurie
gave
his
broad
chest
a
sounding
slap
and
heaved
a
melodramatic
sigh
what's
the
last
joke
undo
the
bundle
and
see
meg
said
beth
eying
the
knobby
parcel
with
curiosity
it's
a
useful
thing
to
have
in
the
house
in
case
of
fire
or
thieves
observed
laurie
as
a
watchman's
rattle
appeared
amid
the
laughter
of
the
girls
illustration
a
small
watchman's
rattle
any
time
when
john
is
away
and
you
get
frightened
mrs
meg
just
swing
that
out
of
the
front
window
and
it
will
rouse
the
neighborhood
in
a
jiffy
nice
thing
isn't
it
and
laurie
gave
them
a
sample
of
its
powers
that
made
them
cover
up
their
ears
there's
gratitude
for
you
and
speaking
of
gratitude
reminds
me
to
mention
that
you
may
thank
hannah
for
saving
your
wedding-cake
from
destruction
i
saw
it
going
into
your
house
as
i
came
by
and
if
she
hadn't
defended
it
manfully
i'd
have
had
a
pick
at
it
for
it
looked
like
a
remarkably
plummy
one
i
wonder
if
you
will
ever
grow
up
laurie
said
meg
in
a
matronly
tone
i'm
doing
my
best
ma'am
but
can't
get
much
higher
i'm
afraid
as
six
feet
is
about
all
men
can
do
in
these
degenerate
days
responded
the
young
gentleman
whose
head
was
about
level
with
the
little
chandelier
i
suppose
it
would
be
profanation
to
eat
anything
in
this
spick
and
span
new
bower
so
as
i'm
tremendously
hungry
i
propose
an
adjournment
he
added
presently
mother
and
i
are
going
to
wait
for
john
there
are
some
last
things
to
settle
said
meg
bustling
away
beth
and
i
are
going
over
to
kitty
bryant's
to
get
more
flowers
for
to-morrow
added
amy
tying
a
picturesque
hat
over
her
picturesque
curls
and
enjoying
the
effect
as
much
as
anybody
come
jo
don't
desert
a
fellow
i'm
in
such
a
state
of
exhaustion
i
can't
get
home
without
help
don't
take
off
your
apron
whatever
you
do
it's
peculiarly
becoming
said
laurie
as
jo
bestowed
his
especial
aversion
in
her
capacious
pocket
and
offered
him
her
arm
to
support
his
feeble
steps
now
teddy
i
want
to
talk
seriously
to
you
about
to-morrow
began
jo
as
they
strolled
away
together
you
_must_
promise
to
behave
well
and
not
cut
up
any
pranks
and
spoil
our
plans
not
a
prank
and
don't
say
funny
things
when
we
ought
to
be
sober
i
never
do
you
are
the
one
for
that
and
i
implore
you
not
to
look
at
me
during
the
ceremony
i
shall
certainly
laugh
if
you
do
you
won't
see
me
you'll
be
crying
so
hard
that
the
thick
fog
round
you
will
obscure
the
prospect
i
never
cry
unless
for
some
great
affliction
such
as
fellows
going
to
college
hey
cut
in
laurie
with
a
suggestive
laugh
don't
be
a
peacock
i
only
moaned
a
trifle
to
keep
the
girls
company
exactly
i
say
jo
how
is
grandpa
this
week
pretty
amiable
very
why
have
you
got
into
a
scrape
and
want
to
know
how
he'll
take
it
asked
jo
rather
sharply
now
jo
do
you
think
i'd
look
your
mother
in
the
face
and
say
'all
right,'
if
it
wasn't
and
laurie
stopped
short
with
an
injured
air
no
i
don't
then
don't
go
and
be
suspicious
i
only
want
some
money
said
laurie
walking
on
again
appeased
by
her
hearty
tone
you
spend
a
great
deal
teddy
bless
you
_i_
don't
spend
it
it
spends
itself
somehow
and
is
gone
before
i
know
it
you
are
so
generous
and
kind-hearted
that
you
let
people
borrow
and
can't
say
'no'
to
any
one
we
heard
about
henshaw
and
all
you
did
for
him
if
you
always
spent
money
in
that
way
no
one
would
blame
you
said
jo
warmly
oh
he
made
a
mountain
out
of
a
mole-hill
you
wouldn't
have
me
let
that
fine
fellow
work
himself
to
death
just
for
the
want
of
a
little
help
when
he
is
worth
a
dozen
of
us
lazy
chaps
would
you
of
course
not
but
i
don't
see
the
use
of
your
having
seventeen
waistcoats
endless
neckties
and
a
new
hat
every
time
you
come
home
i
thought
you'd
got
over
the
dandy
period
but
every
now
and
then
it
breaks
out
in
a
new
spot
just
now
it's
the
fashion
to
be
hideous,--to
make
your
head
look
like
a
scrubbing-brush
wear
a
strait-jacket
orange
gloves
and
clumping
square-toed
boots
if
it
was
cheap
ugliness
i'd
say
nothing
but
it
costs
as
much
as
the
other
and
i
don't
get
any
satisfaction
out
of
it
laurie
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
so
heartily
at
this
attack
that
the
felt-basin
fell
off
and
jo
walked
on
it
which
insult
only
afforded
him
an
opportunity
for
expatiating
on
the
advantages
of
a
rough-and-ready
costume
as
he
folded
up
the
maltreated
hat
and
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
don't
lecture
any
more
there's
a
good
soul
i
have
enough
all
through
the
week
and
like
to
enjoy
myself
when
i
come
home
i'll
get
myself
up
regardless
of
expense
to-morrow
and
be
a
satisfaction
to
my
friends
i'll
leave
you
in
peace
if
you'll
_only_
let
your
hair
grow
i'm
not
aristocratic
but
i
do
object
to
being
seen
with
a
person
who
looks
like
a
young
prize-fighter
observed
jo
severely
this
unassuming
style
promotes
study
that's
why
we
adopt
it
returned
laurie
who
certainly
could
not
be
accused
of
vanity
having
voluntarily
sacrificed
a
handsome
curly
crop
to
the
demand
for
quarter-of-an-inch-long
stubble
by
the
way
jo
i
think
that
little
parker
is
really
getting
desperate
about
amy
he
talks
of
her
constantly
writes
poetry
and
moons
about
in
a
most
suspicious
manner
he'd
better
nip
his
little
passion
in
the
bud
hadn't
he
added
laurie
in
a
confidential
elder-brotherly
tone
after
a
minute's
silence
of
course
he
had
we
don't
want
any
more
marrying
in
this
family
for
years
to
come
mercy
on
us
what
_are_
the
children
thinking
of
and
jo
looked
as
much
scandalized
as
if
amy
and
little
parker
were
not
yet
in
their
teens
it's
a
fast
age
and
i
don't
know
what
we
are
coming
to
ma'am
you
are
a
mere
infant
but
you'll
go
next
jo
and
we'll
be
left
lamenting
said
laurie
shaking
his
head
over
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
don't
be
alarmed
i'm
not
one
of
the
agreeable
sort
nobody
will
want
me
and
it's
a
mercy
for
there
should
always
be
one
old
maid
in
a
family
you
won't
give
any
one
a
chance
said
laurie
with
a
sidelong
glance
and
a
little
more
color
than
before
in
his
sunburnt
face
you
won't
show
the
soft
side
of
your
character
and
if
a
fellow
gets
a
peep
at
it
by
accident
and
can't
help
showing
that
he
likes
it
you
treat
him
as
mrs
gummidge
did
her
sweetheart,--throw
cold
water
over
him,--and
get
so
thorny
no
one
dares
touch
or
look
at
you
i
don't
like
that
sort
of
thing
i'm
too
busy
to
be
worried
with
nonsense
and
i
think
it's
dreadful
to
break
up
families
so
now
don't
say
any
more
about
it
meg's
wedding
has
turned
all
our
heads
and
we
talk
of
nothing
but
lovers
and
such
absurdities
i
don't
wish
to
get
cross
so
let's
change
the
subject
and
jo
looked
quite
ready
to
fling
cold
water
on
the
slightest
provocation
whatever
his
feelings
might
have
been
laurie
found
a
vent
for
them
in
a
long
low
whistle
and
the
fearful
prediction
as
they
parted
at
the
gate
mark
my
words
jo
you'll
go

the
first
wedding
xxv
the
first
wedding
the
june
roses
over
the
porch
were
awake
bright
and
early
on
that
morning
rejoicing
with
all
their
hearts
in
the
cloudless
sunshine
like
friendly
little
neighbors
as
they
were
quite
flushed
with
excitement
were
their
ruddy
faces
as
they
swung
in
the
wind
whispering
to
one
another
what
they
had
seen
for
some
peeped
in
at
the
dining-room
windows
where
the
feast
was
spread
some
climbed
up
to
nod
and
smile
at
the
sisters
as
they
dressed
the
bride
others
waved
a
welcome
to
those
who
came
and
went
on
various
errands
in
garden
porch
and
hall
and
all
from
the
rosiest
full-blown
flower
to
the
palest
baby-bud
offered
their
tribute
of
beauty
and
fragrance
to
the
gentle
mistress
who
had
loved
and
tended
them
so
long
meg
looked
very
like
a
rose
herself
for
all
that
was
best
and
sweetest
in
heart
and
soul
seemed
to
bloom
into
her
face
that
day
making
it
fair
and
tender
with
a
charm
more
beautiful
than
beauty
neither
silk
lace
nor
orange-flowers
would
she
have
i
don't
want
to
look
strange
or
fixed
up
to-day
she
said
i
don't
want
a
fashionable
wedding
but
only
those
about
me
whom
i
love
and
to
them
i
wish
to
look
and
be
my
familiar
self
so
she
made
her
wedding
gown
herself
sewing
into
it
the
tender
hopes
and
innocent
romances
of
a
girlish
heart
her
sisters
braided
up
her
pretty
hair
and
the
only
ornaments
she
wore
were
the
lilies
of
the
valley
which
her
john
liked
best
of
all
the
flowers
that
grew
you
_do_
look
just
like
our
own
dear
meg
only
so
very
sweet
and
lovely
that
i
should
hug
you
if
it
wouldn't
crumple
your
dress
cried
amy
surveying
her
with
delight
when
all
was
done
then
i
am
satisfied
but
please
hug
and
kiss
me
every
one
and
don't
mind
my
dress
i
want
a
great
many
crumples
of
this
sort
put
into
it
to-day
and
meg
opened
her
arms
to
her
sisters
who
clung
about
her
with
april
faces
for
a
minute
feeling
that
the
new
love
had
not
changed
the
old
now
i'm
going
to
tie
john's
cravat
for
him
and
then
to
stay
a
few
minutes
with
father
quietly
in
the
study
and
meg
ran
down
to
perform
these
little
ceremonies
and
then
to
follow
her
mother
wherever
she
went
conscious
that
in
spite
of
the
smiles
on
the
motherly
face
there
was
a
secret
sorrow
hid
in
the
motherly
heart
at
the
flight
of
the
first
bird
from
the
nest
as
the
younger
girls
stand
together
giving
the
last
touches
to
their
simple
toilet
it
may
be
a
good
time
to
tell
of
a
few
changes
which
three
years
have
wrought
in
their
appearance
for
all
are
looking
their
best
just
now
jo's
angles
are
much
softened
she
has
learned
to
carry
herself
with
ease
if
not
grace
the
curly
crop
has
lengthened
into
a
thick
coil
more
becoming
to
the
small
head
atop
of
the
tall
figure
there
is
a
fresh
color
in
her
brown
cheeks
a
soft
shine
in
her
eyes
and
only
gentle
words
fall
from
her
sharp
tongue
to-day
beth
has
grown
slender
pale
and
more
quiet
than
ever
the
beautiful
kind
eyes
are
larger
and
in
them
lies
an
expression
that
saddens
one
although
it
is
not
sad
itself
it
is
the
shadow
of
pain
which
touches
the
young
face
with
such
pathetic
patience
but
beth
seldom
complains
and
always
speaks
hopefully
of
being
better
soon
amy
is
with
truth
considered
the
flower
of
the
family
for
at
sixteen
she
has
the
air
and
bearing
of
a
full-grown
woman--not
beautiful
but
possessed
of
that
indescribable
charm
called
grace
one
saw
it
in
the
lines
of
her
figure
the
make
and
motion
of
her
hands
the
flow
of
her
dress
the
droop
of
her
hair,--unconscious
yet
harmonious
and
as
attractive
to
many
as
beauty
itself
amy's
nose
still
afflicted
her
for
it
never
_would_
grow
grecian
so
did
her
mouth
being
too
wide
and
having
a
decided
chin
these
offending
features
gave
character
to
her
whole
face
but
she
never
could
see
it
and
consoled
herself
with
her
wonderfully
fair
complexion
keen
blue
eyes
and
curls
more
golden
and
abundant
than
ever
all
three
wore
suits
of
thin
silver
gray
their
best
gowns
for
the
summer
with
blush-roses
in
hair
and
bosom
and
all
three
looked
just
what
they
were,--fresh-faced
happy-hearted
girls
pausing
a
moment
in
their
busy
lives
to
read
with
wistful
eyes
the
sweetest
chapter
in
the
romance
of
womanhood
there
were
to
be
no
ceremonious
performances
everything
was
to
be
as
natural
and
homelike
as
possible
so
when
aunt
march
arrived
she
was
scandalized
to
see
the
bride
come
running
to
welcome
and
lead
her
in
to
find
the
bridegroom
fastening
up
a
garland
that
had
fallen
down
and
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
paternal
minister
marching
upstairs
with
a
grave
countenance
and
a
wine-bottle
under
each
arm
upon
my
word
here's
a
state
of
things
cried
the
old
lady
taking
the
seat
of
honor
prepared
for
her
and
settling
the
folds
of
her
lavender
_moire_
with
a
great
rustle
you
oughtn't
to
be
seen
till
the
last
minute
child
i'm
not
a
show
aunty
and
no
one
is
coming
to
stare
at
me
to
criticise
my
dress
or
count
the
cost
of
my
luncheon
i'm
too
happy
to
care
what
any
one
says
or
thinks
and
i'm
going
to
have
my
little
wedding
just
as
i
like
it
john
dear
here's
your
hammer
and
away
went
meg
to
help
that
man
in
his
highly
improper
employment
mr
brooke
didn't
even
say
thank
you
but
as
he
stooped
for
the
unromantic
tool
he
kissed
his
little
bride
behind
the
folding-door
with
a
look
that
made
aunt
march
whisk
out
her
pocket-handkerchief
with
a
sudden
dew
in
her
sharp
old
eyes
a
crash
a
cry
and
a
laugh
from
laurie
accompanied
by
the
indecorous
exclamation
jupiter
ammon
jo's
upset
the
cake
again
caused
a
momentary
flurry
which
was
hardly
over
when
a
flock
of
cousins
arrived
and
the
party
came
in
as
beth
used
to
say
when
a
child
don't
let
that
young
giant
come
near
me
he
worries
me
worse
than
mosquitoes
whispered
the
old
lady
to
amy
as
the
rooms
filled
and
laurie's
black
head
towered
above
the
rest
he
has
promised
to
be
very
good
to-day
and
he
_can_
be
perfectly
elegant
if
he
likes
returned
amy
gliding
away
to
warn
hercules
to
beware
of
the
dragon
which
warning
caused
him
to
haunt
the
old
lady
with
a
devotion
that
nearly
distracted
her
there
was
no
bridal
procession
but
a
sudden
silence
fell
upon
the
room
as
mr
march
and
the
young
pair
took
their
places
under
the
green
arch
mother
and
sisters
gathered
close
as
if
loath
to
give
meg
up
the
fatherly
voice
broke
more
than
once
which
only
seemed
to
make
the
service
more
beautiful
and
solemn
the
bridegroom's
hand
trembled
visibly
and
no
one
heard
his
replies
but
meg
looked
straight
up
in
her
husband's
eyes
and
said
i
will
with
such
tender
trust
in
her
own
face
and
voice
that
her
mother's
heart
rejoiced
and
aunt
march
sniffed
audibly
jo
did
_not_
cry
though
she
was
very
near
it
once
and
was
only
saved
from
a
demonstration
by
the
consciousness
that
laurie
was
staring
fixedly
at
her
with
a
comical
mixture
of
merriment
and
emotion
in
his
wicked
black
eyes
beth
kept
her
face
hidden
on
her
mother's
shoulder
but
amy
stood
like
a
graceful
statue
with
a
most
becoming
ray
of
sunshine
touching
her
white
forehead
and
the
flower
in
her
hair
it
wasn't
at
all
the
thing
i'm
afraid
but
the
minute
she
was
fairly
married
meg
cried
the
first
kiss
for
marmee
and
turning
gave
it
with
her
heart
on
her
lips
during
the
next
fifteen
minutes
she
looked
more
like
a
rose
than
ever
for
every
one
availed
themselves
of
their
privileges
to
the
fullest
extent
from
mr
laurence
to
old
hannah
who
adorned
with
a
head-dress
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
fell
upon
her
in
the
hall
crying
with
a
sob
and
a
chuckle
bless
you
deary
a
hundred
times
the
cake
ain't
hurt
a
mite
and
everything
looks
lovely
everybody
cleared
up
after
that
and
said
something
brilliant
or
tried
to
which
did
just
as
well
for
laughter
is
ready
when
hearts
are
light
there
was
no
display
of
gifts
for
they
were
already
in
the
little
house
nor
was
there
an
elaborate
breakfast
but
a
plentiful
lunch
of
cake
and
fruit
dressed
with
flowers
mr
laurence
and
aunt
march
shrugged
and
smiled
at
one
another
when
water
lemonade
and
coffee
were
found
to
be
the
only
sorts
of
nectar
which
the
three
hebes
carried
round
no
one
said
anything
however
till
laurie
who
insisted
on
serving
the
bride
appeared
before
her
with
a
loaded
salver
in
his
hand
and
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
has
jo
smashed
all
the
bottles
by
accident
he
whispered
or
am
i
merely
laboring
under
a
delusion
that
i
saw
some
lying
about
loose
this
morning
no
your
grandfather
kindly
offered
us
his
best
and
aunt
march
actually
sent
some
but
father
put
away
a
little
for
beth
and
despatched
the
rest
to
the
soldiers'
home
you
know
he
thinks
that
wine
should
be
used
only
in
illness
and
mother
says
that
neither
she
nor
her
daughters
will
ever
offer
it
to
any
young
man
under
her
roof
meg
spoke
seriously
and
expected
to
see
laurie
frown
or
laugh
but
he
did
neither
for
after
a
quick
look
at
her
he
said
in
his
impetuous
way
i
like
that
for
i've
seen
enough
harm
done
to
wish
other
women
would
think
as
you
do
you
are
not
made
wise
by
experience
i
hope
and
there
was
an
anxious
accent
in
meg's
voice
no
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
don't
think
too
well
of
me
either
this
is
not
one
of
my
temptations
being
brought
up
where
wine
is
as
common
as
water
and
almost
as
harmless
i
don't
care
for
it
but
when
a
pretty
girl
offers
it
one
doesn't
like
to
refuse
you
see
but
you
will
for
the
sake
of
others
if
not
for
your
own
come
laurie
promise
and
give
me
one
more
reason
to
call
this
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
a
demand
so
sudden
and
so
serious
made
the
young
man
hesitate
a
moment
for
ridicule
is
often
harder
to
bear
than
self-denial
meg
knew
that
if
he
gave
the
promise
he
would
keep
it
at
all
costs
and
feeling
her
power
used
it
as
a
woman
may
for
her
friend's
good
she
did
not
speak
but
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
face
made
very
eloquent
by
happiness
and
a
smile
which
said
no
one
can
refuse
me
anything
to-day
laurie
certainly
could
not
and
with
an
answering
smile
he
gave
her
his
hand
saying
heartily
i
promise
mrs
brooke
i
thank
you
very
very
much
and
i
drink
'long
life
to
your
resolution,'
teddy
cried
jo
baptizing
him
with
a
splash
of
lemonade
as
she
waved
her
glass
and
beamed
approvingly
upon
him
so
the
toast
was
drunk
the
pledge
made
and
loyally
kept
in
spite
of
many
temptations
for
with
instinctive
wisdom
the
girls
had
seized
a
happy
moment
to
do
their
friend
a
service
for
which
he
thanked
them
all
his
life
after
lunch
people
strolled
about
by
twos
and
threes
through
house
and
garden
enjoying
the
sunshine
without
and
within
meg
and
john
happened
to
be
standing
together
in
the
middle
of
the
grass-plot
when
laurie
was
seized
with
an
inspiration
which
put
the
finishing
touch
to
this
unfashionable
wedding
all
the
married
people
take
hands
and
dance
round
the
new-made
husband
and
wife
as
the
germans
do
while
we
bachelors
and
spinsters
prance
in
couples
outside
cried
laurie
promenading
down
the
path
with
amy
with
such
infectious
spirit
and
skill
that
every
one
else
followed
their
example
without
a
murmur
mr
and
mrs
march
aunt
and
uncle
carrol
began
it
others
rapidly
joined
in
even
sallie
moffat
after
a
moment's
hesitation
threw
her
train
over
her
arm
and
whisked
ned
into
the
ring
but
the
crowning
joke
was
mr
laurence
and
aunt
march
for
when
the
stately
old
gentleman
_chasséed_
solemnly
up
to
the
old
lady
she
just
tucked
her
cane
under
her
arm
and
hopped
briskly
away
to
join
hands
with
the
rest
and
dance
about
the
bridal
pair
while
the
young
folks
pervaded
the
garden
like
butterflies
on
a
midsummer
day
want
of
breath
brought
the
impromptu
ball
to
a
close
and
then
people
began
to
go
i
wish
you
well
my
dear
i
heartily
wish
you
well
but
i
think
you'll
be
sorry
for
it
said
aunt
march
to
meg
adding
to
the
bridegroom
as
he
led
her
to
the
carriage
you've
got
a
treasure
young
man
see
that
you
deserve
it
that
is
the
prettiest
wedding
i've
been
to
for
an
age
ned
and
i
don't
see
why
for
there
wasn't
a
bit
of
style
about
it
observed
mrs
moffat
to
her
husband
as
they
drove
away
laurie
my
lad
if
you
ever
want
to
indulge
in
this
sort
of
thing
get
one
of
those
little
girls
to
help
you
and
i
shall
be
perfectly
satisfied
said
mr
laurence
settling
himself
in
his
easy-chair
to
rest
after
the
excitement
of
the
morning
i'll
do
my
best
to
gratify
you
sir
was
laurie's
unusually
dutiful
reply
as
he
carefully
unpinned
the
posy
jo
had
put
in
his
button-hole
the
little
house
was
not
far
away
and
the
only
bridal
journey
meg
had
was
the
quiet
walk
with
john
from
the
old
home
to
the
new
when
she
came
down
looking
like
a
pretty
quakeress
in
her
dove-colored
suit
and
straw
bonnet
tied
with
white
they
all
gathered
about
her
to
say
good-by
as
tenderly
as
if
she
had
been
going
to
make
the
grand
tour
don't
feel
that
i
am
separated
from
you
marmee
dear
or
that
i
love
you
any
the
less
for
loving
john
so
much
she
said
clinging
to
her
mother
with
full
eyes
for
a
moment
i
shall
come
every
day
father
and
expect
to
keep
my
old
place
in
all
your
hearts
though
i
_am_
married
beth
is
going
to
be
with
me
a
great
deal
and
the
other
girls
will
drop
in
now
and
then
to
laugh
at
my
housekeeping
struggles
thank
you
all
for
my
happy
wedding-day
good-by
good-by
they
stood
watching
her
with
faces
full
of
love
and
hope
and
tender
pride
as
she
walked
away
leaning
on
her
husband's
arm
with
her
hands
full
of
flowers
and
the
june
sunshine
brightening
her
happy
face,--and
so
meg's
married
life
began
illustration

attempts
xxvi
artistic
attempts
it
takes
people
a
long
time
to
learn
the
difference
between
talent
and
genius
especially
ambitious
young
men
and
women
amy
was
learning
this
distinction
through
much
tribulation
for
mistaking
enthusiasm
for
inspiration
she
attempted
every
branch
of
art
with
youthful
audacity
for
a
long
time
there
was
a
lull
in
the
mud-pie
business
and
she
devoted
herself
to
the
finest
pen-and-ink
drawing
in
which
she
showed
such
taste
and
skill
that
her
graceful
handiwork
proved
both
pleasant
and
profitable
but
overstrained
eyes
soon
caused
pen
and
ink
to
be
laid
aside
for
a
bold
attempt
at
poker-sketching
while
this
attack
lasted
the
family
lived
in
constant
fear
of
a
conflagration
for
the
odor
of
burning
wood
pervaded
the
house
at
all
hours
smoke
issued
from
attic
and
shed
with
alarming
frequency
red-hot
pokers
lay
about
promiscuously
and
hannah
never
went
to
bed
without
a
pail
of
water
and
the
dinner-bell
at
her
door
in
case
of
fire
raphael's
face
was
found
boldly
executed
on
the
under
side
of
the
moulding-board
and
bacchus
on
the
head
of
a
beer-barrel
a
chanting
cherub
adorned
the
cover
of
the
sugar-bucket
and
attempts
to
portray
romeo
and
juliet
supplied
kindlings
for
some
time
from
fire
to
oil
was
a
natural
transition
for
burnt
fingers
and
amy
fell
to
painting
with
undiminished
ardor
an
artist
friend
fitted
her
out
with
his
cast-off
palettes
brushes
and
colors
and
she
daubed
away
producing
pastoral
and
marine
views
such
as
were
never
seen
on
land
or
sea
her
monstrosities
in
the
way
of
cattle
would
have
taken
prizes
at
an
agricultural
fair
and
the
perilous
pitching
of
her
vessels
would
have
produced
sea-sickness
in
the
most
nautical
observer
if
the
utter
disregard
to
all
known
rules
of
shipbuilding
and
rigging
had
not
convulsed
him
with
laughter
at
the
first
glance
swarthy
boys
and
dark-eyed
madonnas
staring
at
you
from
one
corner
of
the
studio
suggested
murillo
oily-brown
shadows
of
faces
with
a
lurid
streak
in
the
wrong
place
meant
rembrandt
buxom
ladies
and
dropsical
infants
rubens
and
turner
appeared
in
tempests
of
blue
thunder
orange
lightning
brown
rain
and
purple
clouds
with
a
tomato-colored
splash
in
the
middle
which
might
be
the
sun
or
a
buoy
a
sailor's
shirt
or
a
king's
robe
as
the
spectator
pleased
charcoal
portraits
came
next
and
the
entire
family
hung
in
a
row
looking
as
wild
and
crocky
as
if
just
evoked
from
a
coal-bin
softened
into
crayon
sketches
they
did
better
for
the
likenesses
were
good
and
amy's
hair
jo's
nose
meg's
mouth
and
laurie's
eyes
were
pronounced
wonderfully
fine
a
return
to
clay
and
plaster
followed
and
ghostly
casts
of
her
acquaintances
haunted
corners
of
the
house
or
tumbled
off
closet-shelves
on
to
people's
heads
children
were
enticed
in
as
models
till
their
incoherent
accounts
of
her
mysterious
doings
caused
miss
amy
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
young
ogress
her
efforts
in
this
line
however
were
brought
to
an
abrupt
close
by
an
untoward
accident
which
quenched
her
ardor
other
models
failing
her
for
a
time
she
undertook
to
cast
her
own
pretty
foot
and
the
family
were
one
day
alarmed
by
an
unearthly
bumping
and
screaming
and
running
to
the
rescue
found
the
young
enthusiast
hopping
wildly
about
the
shed
with
her
foot
held
fast
in
a
pan-full
of
plaster
which
had
hardened
with
unexpected
rapidity
with
much
difficulty
and
some
danger
she
was
dug
out
for
jo
was
so
overcome
with
laughter
while
she
excavated
that
her
knife
went
too
far
cut
the
poor
foot
and
left
a
lasting
memorial
of
one
artistic
attempt
at
least
illustration
her
foot
held
fast
in
a
panful
of
plaster
after
this
amy
subsided
till
a
mania
for
sketching
from
nature
set
her
to
haunting
river
field
and
wood
for
picturesque
studies
and
sighing
for
ruins
to
copy
she
caught
endless
colds
sitting
on
damp
grass
to
book
a
delicious
bit
composed
of
a
stone
a
stump
one
mushroom
and
a
broken
mullein-stalk
or
a
heavenly
mass
of
clouds
that
looked
like
a
choice
display
of
feather-beds
when
done
she
sacrificed
her
complexion
floating
on
the
river
in
the
midsummer
sun
to
study
light
and
shade
and
got
a
wrinkle
over
her
nose
trying
after
points
of
sight
or
whatever
the
squint-and-string
performance
is
called
if
genius
is
eternal
patience
as
michael
angelo
affirms
amy
certainly
had
some
claim
to
the
divine
attribute
for
she
persevered
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
failures
and
discouragements
firmly
believing
that
in
time
she
should
do
something
worthy
to
be
called
high
art
she
was
learning
doing
and
enjoying
other
things
meanwhile
for
she
had
resolved
to
be
an
attractive
and
accomplished
woman
even
if
she
never
became
a
great
artist
here
she
succeeded
better
for
she
was
one
of
those
happily
created
beings
who
please
without
effort
make
friends
everywhere
and
take
life
so
gracefully
and
easily
that
less
fortunate
souls
are
tempted
to
believe
that
such
are
born
under
a
lucky
star
everybody
liked
her
for
among
her
good
gifts
was
tact
she
had
an
instinctive
sense
of
what
was
pleasing
and
proper
always
said
the
right
thing
to
the
right
person
did
just
what
suited
the
time
and
place
and
was
so
self-possessed
that
her
sisters
used
to
say
if
amy
went
to
court
without
any
rehearsal
beforehand
she'd
know
exactly
what
to
do
one
of
her
weaknesses
was
a
desire
to
move
in
our
best
society
without
being
quite
sure
what
the
_best_
really
was
money
position
fashionable
accomplishments
and
elegant
manners
were
most
desirable
things
in
her
eyes
and
she
liked
to
associate
with
those
who
possessed
them
often
mistaking
the
false
for
the
true
and
admiring
what
was
not
admirable
never
forgetting
that
by
birth
she
was
a
gentlewoman
she
cultivated
her
aristocratic
tastes
and
feelings
so
that
when
the
opportunity
came
she
might
be
ready
to
take
the
place
from
which
poverty
now
excluded
her
my
lady
as
her
friends
called
her
sincerely
desired
to
be
a
genuine
lady
and
was
so
at
heart
but
had
yet
to
learn
that
money
cannot
buy
refinement
of
nature
that
rank
does
not
always
confer
nobility
and
that
true
breeding
makes
itself
felt
in
spite
of
external
drawbacks
i
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
mamma
amy
said
coming
in
with
an
important
air
one
day
well
little
girl
what
is
it
replied
her
mother
in
whose
eyes
the
stately
young
lady
still
remained
the
baby
our
drawing
class
breaks
up
next
week
and
before
the
girls
separate
for
the
summer
i
want
to
ask
them
out
here
for
a
day
they
are
wild
to
see
the
river
sketch
the
broken
bridge
and
copy
some
of
the
things
they
admire
in
my
book
they
have
been
very
kind
to
me
in
many
ways
and
i
am
grateful
for
they
are
all
rich
and
know
i
am
poor
yet
they
never
made
any
difference
why
should
they
and
mrs
march
put
the
question
with
what
the
girls
called
her
maria
theresa
air
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
it
_does_
make
a
difference
with
nearly
every
one
so
don't
ruffle
up
like
a
dear
motherly
hen
when
your
chickens
get
pecked
by
smarter
birds
the
ugly
duckling
turned
out
a
swan
you
know
and
amy
smiled
without
bitterness
for
she
possessed
a
happy
temper
and
hopeful
spirit
mrs
march
laughed
and
smoothed
down
her
maternal
pride
as
she
asked,--
well
my
swan
what
is
your
plan
i
should
like
to
ask
the
girls
out
to
lunch
next
week
to
take
them
a
drive
to
the
places
they
want
to
see
a
row
on
the
river
perhaps
and
make
a
little
artistic
_fête_
for
them
that
looks
feasible
what
do
you
want
for
lunch
cake
sandwiches
fruit
and
coffee
will
be
all
that
is
necessary
i
suppose
oh
dear
no
we
must
have
cold
tongue
and
chicken
french
chocolate
and
ice-cream
besides
the
girls
are
used
to
such
things
and
i
want
my
lunch
to
be
proper
and
elegant
though
i
_do_
work
for
my
living
how
many
young
ladies
are
there
asked
her
mother
beginning
to
look
sober
twelve
or
fourteen
in
the
class
but
i
dare
say
they
won't
all
come
bless
me
child
you
will
have
to
charter
an
omnibus
to
carry
them
about
why
mother
how
_can_
you
think
of
such
a
thing
not
more
than
six
or
eight
will
probably
come
so
i
shall
hire
a
beach-wagon
and
borrow
mr
laurence's
cherry-bounce
hannah's
pronunciation
of
_char-à-banc_
all
this
will
be
expensive
amy
not
very
i've
calculated
the
cost
and
i'll
pay
for
it
myself
don't
you
think
dear
that
as
these
girls
are
used
to
such
things
and
the
best
we
can
do
will
be
nothing
new
that
some
simpler
plan
would
be
pleasanter
to
them
as
a
change
if
nothing
more
and
much
better
for
us
than
buying
or
borrowing
what
we
don't
need
and
attempting
a
style
not
in
keeping
with
our
circumstances
if
i
can't
have
it
as
i
like
i
don't
care
to
have
it
at
all
i
know
that
i
can
carry
it
out
perfectly
well
if
you
and
the
girls
will
help
a
little
and
i
don't
see
why
i
can't
if
i'm
willing
to
pay
for
it
said
amy
with
the
decision
which
opposition
was
apt
to
change
into
obstinacy
mrs
march
knew
that
experience
was
an
excellent
teacher
and
when
it
was
possible
she
left
her
children
to
learn
alone
the
lessons
which
she
would
gladly
have
made
easier
if
they
had
not
objected
to
taking
advice
as
much
as
they
did
salts
and
senna
very
well
amy
if
your
heart
is
set
upon
it
and
you
see
your
way
through
without
too
great
an
outlay
of
money
time
and
temper
i'll
say
no
more
talk
it
over
with
the
girls
and
whichever
way
you
decide
i'll
do
my
best
to
help
you
thanks
mother
you
are
always
_so_
kind
and
away
went
amy
to
lay
her
plan
before
her
sisters
meg
agreed
at
once
and
promised
her
aid
gladly
offering
anything
she
possessed
from
her
little
house
itself
to
her
very
best
salt-spoons
but
jo
frowned
upon
the
whole
project
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
first
why
in
the
world
should
you
spend
your
money
worry
your
family
and
turn
the
house
upside
down
for
a
parcel
of
girls
who
don't
care
a
sixpence
for
you
i
thought
you
had
too
much
pride
and
sense
to
truckle
to
any
mortal
woman
just
because
she
wears
french
boots
and
rides
in
a
_coupé_
said
jo
who
being
called
from
the
tragical
climax
of
her
novel
was
not
in
the
best
mood
for
social
enterprises
i
_don't_
truckle
and
i
hate
being
patronized
as
much
as
you
do
returned
amy
indignantly
for
the
two
still
jangled
when
such
questions
arose
the
girls
do
care
for
me
and
i
for
them
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
kindness
and
sense
and
talent
among
them
in
spite
of
what
you
call
fashionable
nonsense
you
don't
care
to
make
people
like
you
to
go
into
good
society
and
cultivate
your
manners
and
tastes
i
do
and
i
mean
to
make
the
most
of
every
chance
that
comes
_you_
can
go
through
the
world
with
your
elbows
out
and
your
nose
in
the
air
and
call
it
independence
if
you
like
that's
not
my
way
when
amy
whetted
her
tongue
and
freed
her
mind
she
usually
got
the
best
of
it
for
she
seldom
failed
to
have
common
sense
on
her
side
while
jo
carried
her
love
of
liberty
and
hate
of
conventionalities
to
such
an
unlimited
extent
that
she
naturally
found
herself
worsted
in
an
argument
amy's
definition
of
jo's
idea
of
independence
was
such
a
good
hit
that
both
burst
out
laughing
and
the
discussion
took
a
more
amiable
turn
much
against
her
will
jo
at
length
consented
to
sacrifice
a
day
to
mrs
grundy
and
help
her
sister
through
what
she
regarded
as
a
nonsensical
business
the
invitations
were
sent
nearly
all
accepted
and
the
following
monday
was
set
apart
for
the
grand
event
hannah
was
out
of
humor
because
her
week's
work
was
deranged
and
prophesied
that
ef
the
washin'
and
ironin'
warn't
done
reg'lar
nothin'
would
go
well
anywheres
this
hitch
in
the
mainspring
of
the
domestic
machinery
had
a
bad
effect
upon
the
whole
concern
but
amy's
motto
was
nil
desperandum
and
having
made
up
her
mind
what
to
do
she
proceeded
to
do
it
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
to
begin
with
hannah's
cooking
didn't
turn
out
well
the
chicken
was
tough
the
tongue
too
salt
and
the
chocolate
wouldn't
froth
properly
then
the
cake
and
ice
cost
more
than
amy
expected
so
did
the
wagon
and
various
other
expenses
which
seemed
trifling
at
the
outset
counted
up
rather
alarmingly
afterward
beth
got
cold
and
took
to
her
bed
meg
had
an
unusual
number
of
callers
to
keep
her
at
home
and
jo
was
in
such
a
divided
state
of
mind
that
her
breakages
accidents
and
mistakes
were
uncommonly
numerous
serious
and
trying
if
it
hadn't
been
for
mother
i
never
should
have
got
through
as
amy
declared
afterward
and
gratefully
remembered
when
the
best
joke
of
the
season
was
entirely
forgotten
by
everybody
else
if
it
was
not
fair
on
monday
the
young
ladies
were
to
come
on
tuesday,--an
arrangement
which
aggravated
jo
and
hannah
to
the
last
degree
on
monday
morning
the
weather
was
in
that
undecided
state
which
is
more
exasperating
than
a
steady
pour
it
drizzled
a
little
shone
a
little
blew
a
little
and
didn't
make
up
its
mind
till
it
was
too
late
for
any
one
else
to
make
up
theirs
amy
was
up
at
dawn
hustling
people
out
of
their
beds
and
through
their
breakfasts
that
the
house
might
be
got
in
order
the
parlor
struck
her
as
looking
uncommonly
shabby
but
without
stopping
to
sigh
for
what
she
had
not
she
skilfully
made
the
best
of
what
she
had
arranging
chairs
over
the
worn
places
in
the
carpet
covering
stains
on
the
walls
with
pictures
framed
in
ivy
and
filling
up
empty
corners
with
home-made
statuary
which
gave
an
artistic
air
to
the
room
as
did
the
lovely
vases
of
flowers
jo
scattered
about
the
lunch
looked
charmingly
and
as
she
surveyed
it
she
sincerely
hoped
it
would
taste
well
and
that
the
borrowed
glass
china
and
silver
would
get
safely
home
again
the
carriages
were
promised
meg
and
mother
were
all
ready
to
do
the
honors
beth
was
able
to
help
hannah
behind
the
scenes
jo
had
engaged
to
be
as
lively
and
amiable
as
an
absent
mind
an
aching
head
and
a
very
decided
disapproval
of
everybody
and
everything
would
allow
and
as
she
wearily
dressed
amy
cheered
herself
with
anticipations
of
the
happy
moment
when
lunch
safely
over
she
should
drive
away
with
her
friends
for
an
afternoon
of
artistic
delights
for
the
cherry-bounce
and
the
broken
bridge
were
her
strong
points
then
came
two
hours
of
suspense
during
which
she
vibrated
from
parlor
to
porch
while
public
opinion
varied
like
the
weathercock
a
smart
shower
at
eleven
had
evidently
quenched
the
enthusiasm
of
the
young
ladies
who
were
to
arrive
at
twelve
for
nobody
came
and
at
two
the
exhausted
family
sat
down
in
a
blaze
of
sunshine
to
consume
the
perishable
portions
of
the
feast
that
nothing
might
be
lost
no
doubt
about
the
weather
to-day
they
will
certainly
come
so
we
must
fly
round
and
be
ready
for
them
said
amy
as
the
sun
woke
her
next
morning
she
spoke
briskly
but
in
her
secret
soul
she
wished
she
had
said
nothing
about
tuesday
for
her
interest
like
her
cake
was
getting
a
little
stale
i
can't
get
any
lobsters
so
you
will
have
to
do
without
salad
to-day
said
mr
march
coming
in
half
an
hour
later
with
an
expression
of
placid
despair
use
the
chicken
then
the
toughness
won't
matter
in
a
salad
advised
his
wife
hannah
left
it
on
the
kitchen-table
a
minute
and
the
kittens
got
at
it
i'm
very
sorry
amy
added
beth
who
was
still
a
patroness
of
cats
then
i
_must_
have
a
lobster
for
tongue
alone
won't
do
said
amy
decidedly
shall
i
rush
into
town
and
demand
one
asked
jo
with
the
magnanimity
of
a
martyr
you'd
come
bringing
it
home
under
your
arm
without
any
paper
just
to
try
me
i'll
go
myself
answered
amy
whose
temper
was
beginning
to
fail
shrouded
in
a
thick
veil
and
armed
with
a
genteel
travelling-basket
she
departed
feeling
that
a
cool
drive
would
soothe
her
ruffled
spirit
and
fit
her
for
the
labors
of
the
day
after
some
delay
the
object
of
her
desire
was
procured
likewise
a
bottle
of
dressing
to
prevent
further
loss
of
time
at
home
and
off
she
drove
again
well
pleased
with
her
own
forethought
as
the
omnibus
contained
only
one
other
passenger
a
sleepy
old
lady
amy
pocketed
her
veil
and
beguiled
the
tedium
of
the
way
by
trying
to
find
out
where
all
her
money
had
gone
to
so
busy
was
she
with
her
card
full
of
refractory
figures
that
she
did
not
observe
a
new-comer
who
entered
without
stopping
the
vehicle
till
a
masculine
voice
said
good-morning
miss
march
and
looking
up
she
beheld
one
of
laurie's
most
elegant
college
friends
fervently
hoping
that
he
would
get
out
before
she
did
amy
utterly
ignored
the
basket
at
her
feet
and
congratulating
herself
that
she
had
on
her
new
travelling
dress
returned
the
young
man's
greeting
with
her
usual
suavity
and
spirit
they
got
on
excellently
for
amy's
chief
care
was
soon
set
at
rest
by
learning
that
the
gentleman
would
leave
first
and
she
was
chatting
away
in
a
peculiarly
lofty
strain
when
the
old
lady
got
out
in
stumbling
to
the
door
she
upset
the
basket
and--oh
horror!--the
lobster
in
all
its
vulgar
size
and
brilliancy
was
revealed
to
the
highborn
eyes
of
a
tudor
by
jove
she's
forgotten
her
dinner
cried
the
unconscious
youth
poking
the
scarlet
monster
into
its
place
with
his
cane
and
preparing
to
hand
out
the
basket
after
the
old
lady
please
don't--it's--it's
mine
murmured
amy
with
a
face
nearly
as
red
as
her
fish
illustration
please
don't
it's
mine
oh
really
i
beg
pardon
it's
an
uncommonly
fine
one
isn't
it
said
tudor
with
great
presence
of
mind
and
an
air
of
sober
interest
that
did
credit
to
his
breeding
amy
recovered
herself
in
a
breath
set
her
basket
boldly
on
the
seat
and
said
laughing,--
don't
you
wish
you
were
to
have
some
of
the
salad
he's
to
make
and
to
see
the
charming
young
ladies
who
are
to
eat
it
now
that
was
tact
for
two
of
the
ruling
foibles
of
the
masculine
mind
were
touched
the
lobster
was
instantly
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
pleasing
reminiscences
and
curiosity
about
the
charming
young
ladies
diverted
his
mind
from
the
comical
mishap
i
suppose
he'll
laugh
and
joke
over
it
with
laurie
but
i
sha'n't
see
them
that's
a
comfort
thought
amy
as
tudor
bowed
and
departed
she
did
not
mention
this
meeting
at
home
though
she
discovered
that
thanks
to
the
upset
her
new
dress
was
much
damaged
by
the
rivulets
of
dressing
that
meandered
down
the
skirt
but
went
through
with
the
preparations
which
now
seemed
more
irksome
than
before
and
at
twelve
o'clock
all
was
ready
again
feeling
that
the
neighbors
were
interested
in
her
movements
she
wished
to
efface
the
memory
of
yesterday's
failure
by
a
grand
success
to-day
so
she
ordered
the
cherry-bounce
and
drove
away
in
state
to
meet
and
escort
her
guests
to
the
banquet
there's
the
rumble
they're
coming
i'll
go
into
the
porch
to
meet
them
it
looks
hospitable
and
i
want
the
poor
child
to
have
a
good
time
after
all
her
trouble
said
mrs
march
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
but
after
one
glance
she
retired
with
an
indescribable
expression
for
looking
quite
lost
in
the
big
carriage
sat
amy
and
one
young
lady
run
beth
and
help
hannah
clear
half
the
things
off
the
table
it
will
be
too
absurd
to
put
a
luncheon
for
twelve
before
a
single
girl
cried
jo
hurrying
away
to
the
lower
regions
too
excited
to
stop
even
for
a
laugh
in
came
amy
quite
calm
and
delightfully
cordial
to
the
one
guest
who
had
kept
her
promise
the
rest
of
the
family
being
of
a
dramatic
turn
played
their
parts
equally
well
and
miss
eliott
found
them
a
most
hilarious
set
for
it
was
impossible
to
entirely
control
the
merriment
which
possessed
them
the
remodelled
lunch
being
gayly
partaken
of
the
studio
and
garden
visited
and
art
discussed
with
enthusiasm
amy
ordered
a
buggy
alas
for
the
elegant
cherry-bounce
and
drove
her
friend
quietly
about
the
neighborhood
till
sunset
when
the
party
went
out
as
she
came
walking
in
looking
very
tired
but
as
composed
as
ever
she
observed
that
every
vestige
of
the
unfortunate
_fête_
had
disappeared
except
a
suspicious
pucker
about
the
corners
of
jo's
mouth
you've
had
a
lovely
afternoon
for
your
drive
dear
said
her
mother
as
respectfully
as
if
the
whole
twelve
had
come
miss
eliott
is
a
very
sweet
girl
and
seemed
to
enjoy
herself
i
thought
observed
beth
with
unusual
warmth
could
you
spare
me
some
of
your
cake
i
really
need
some
i
have
so
much
company
and
i
can't
make
such
delicious
stuff
as
yours
asked
meg
soberly
take
it
all
i'm
the
only
one
here
who
likes
sweet
things
and
it
will
mould
before
i
can
dispose
of
it
answered
amy
thinking
with
a
sigh
of
the
generous
store
she
had
laid
in
for
such
an
end
as
this
it's
a
pity
laurie
isn't
here
to
help
us
began
jo
as
they
sat
down
to
ice-cream
and
salad
for
the
second
time
in
two
days
a
warning
look
from
her
mother
checked
any
further
remarks
and
the
whole
family
ate
in
heroic
silence
till
mr
march
mildly
observed
salad
was
one
of
the
favorite
dishes
of
the
ancients
and
evelyn"--here
a
general
explosion
of
laughter
cut
short
the
history
of
sallets
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
learned
gentleman
bundle
everything
into
a
basket
and
send
it
to
the
hummels
germans
like
messes
i'm
sick
of
the
sight
of
this
and
there's
no
reason
you
should
all
die
of
a
surfeit
because
i've
been
a
fool
cried
amy
wiping
her
eyes
i
thought
i
_should_
have
died
when
i
saw
you
two
girls
rattling
about
in
the
what-you-call-it
like
two
little
kernels
in
a
very
big
nutshell
and
mother
waiting
in
state
to
receive
the
throng
sighed
jo
quite
spent
with
laughter
i'm
very
sorry
you
were
disappointed
dear
but
we
all
did
our
best
to
satisfy
you
said
mrs
march
in
a
tone
full
of
motherly
regret
i
_am_
satisfied
i've
done
what
i
undertook
and
it's
not
my
fault
that
it
failed
i
comfort
myself
with
that
said
amy
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
voice
i
thank
you
all
very
much
for
helping
me
and
i'll
thank
you
still
more
if
you
won't
allude
to
it
for
a
month
at
least
no
one
did
for
several
months
but
the
word
_fête_
always
produced
a
general
smile
and
laurie's
birthday
gift
to
amy
was
a
tiny
coral
lobster
in
the
shape
of
a
charm
for
her

fortune
suddenly
smiled
upon
jo
and
dropped
a
good-luck
penny
in
her
path
not
a
golden
penny
exactly
but
i
doubt
if
half
a
million
would
have
given
more
real
happiness
than
did
the
little
sum
that
came
to
her
in
this
wise
every
few
weeks
she
would
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
put
on
her
scribbling
suit
and
fall
into
a
vortex
as
she
expressed
it
writing
away
at
her
novel
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
for
till
that
was
finished
she
could
find
no
peace
her
scribbling
suit
consisted
of
a
black
woollen
pinafore
on
which
she
could
wipe
her
pen
at
will
and
a
cap
of
the
same
material
adorned
with
a
cheerful
red
bow
into
which
she
bundled
her
hair
when
the
decks
were
cleared
for
action
this
cap
was
a
beacon
to
the
inquiring
eyes
of
her
family
who
during
these
periods
kept
their
distance
merely
popping
in
their
heads
semi-occasionally
to
ask
with
interest
does
genius
burn
jo
they
did
not
always
venture
even
to
ask
this
question
but
took
an
observation
of
the
cap
and
judged
accordingly
if
this
expressive
article
of
dress
was
drawn
low
upon
the
forehead
it
was
a
sign
that
hard
work
was
going
on
in
exciting
moments
it
was
pushed
rakishly
askew
and
when
despair
seized
the
author
it
was
plucked
wholly
off
and
cast
upon
the
floor
at
such
times
the
intruder
silently
withdrew
and
not
until
the
red
bow
was
seen
gayly
erect
upon
the
gifted
brow
did
any
one
dare
address
jo
she
did
not
think
herself
a
genius
by
any
means
but
when
the
writing
fit
came
on
she
gave
herself
up
to
it
with
entire
abandon
and
led
a
blissful
life
unconscious
of
want
care
or
bad
weather
while
she
sat
safe
and
happy
in
an
imaginary
world
full
of
friends
almost
as
real
and
dear
to
her
as
any
in
the
flesh
sleep
forsook
her
eyes
meals
stood
untasted
day
and
night
were
all
too
short
to
enjoy
the
happiness
which
blessed
her
only
at
such
times
and
made
these
hours
worth
living
even
if
they
bore
no
other
fruit
the
divine
afflatus
usually
lasted
a
week
or
two
and
then
she
emerged
from
her
vortex
hungry
sleepy
cross
or
despondent
she
was
just
recovering
from
one
of
these
attacks
when
she
was
prevailed
upon
to
escort
miss
crocker
to
a
lecture
and
in
return
for
her
virtue
was
rewarded
with
a
new
idea
it
was
a
people's
course
the
lecture
on
the
pyramids
and
jo
rather
wondered
at
the
choice
of
such
a
subject
for
such
an
audience
but
took
it
for
granted
that
some
great
social
evil
would
be
remedied
or
some
great
want
supplied
by
unfolding
the
glories
of
the
pharaohs
to
an
audience
whose
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
price
of
coal
and
flour
and
whose
lives
were
spent
in
trying
to
solve
harder
riddles
than
that
of
the
sphinx
they
were
early
and
while
miss
crocker
set
the
heel
of
her
stocking
jo
amused
herself
by
examining
the
faces
of
the
people
who
occupied
the
seat
with
them
on
her
left
were
two
matrons
with
massive
foreheads
and
bonnets
to
match
discussing
woman's
rights
and
making
tatting
beyond
sat
a
pair
of
humble
lovers
artlessly
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
a
sombre
spinster
eating
peppermints
out
of
a
paper
bag
and
an
old
gentleman
taking
his
preparatory
nap
behind
a
yellow
bandanna
on
her
right
her
only
neighbor
was
a
studious-looking
lad
absorbed
in
a
newspaper
it
was
a
pictorial
sheet
and
jo
examined
the
work
of
art
nearest
her
idly
wondering
what
unfortuitous
concatenation
of
circumstances
needed
the
melodramatic
illustration
of
an
indian
in
full
war
costume
tumbling
over
a
precipice
with
a
wolf
at
his
throat
while
two
infuriated
young
gentlemen
with
unnaturally
small
feet
and
big
eyes
were
stabbing
each
other
close
by
and
a
dishevelled
female
was
flying
away
in
the
background
with
her
mouth
wide
open
pausing
to
turn
a
page
the
lad
saw
her
looking
and
with
boyish
good-nature
offered
half
his
paper
saying
bluntly
want
to
read
it
that's
a
first-rate
story
jo
accepted
it
with
a
smile
for
she
had
never
outgrown
her
liking
for
lads
and
soon
found
herself
involved
in
the
usual
labyrinth
of
love
mystery
and
murder
for
the
story
belonged
to
that
class
of
light
literature
in
which
the
passions
have
a
holiday
and
when
the
author's
invention
fails
a
grand
catastrophe
clears
the
stage
of
one
half
the
_dramatis
personæ_
leaving
the
other
half
to
exult
over
their
downfall
prime
isn't
it
asked
the
boy
as
her
eye
went
down
the
last
paragraph
of
her
portion
i
think
you
and
i
could
do
as
well
as
that
if
we
tried
returned
jo
amused
at
his
admiration
of
the
trash
i
should
think
i
was
a
pretty
lucky
chap
if
i
could
she
makes
a
good
living
out
of
such
stories
they
say
and
he
pointed
to
the
name
of
mrs
s
l
a
n
g
northbury
under
the
title
of
the
tale
do
you
know
her
asked
jo
with
sudden
interest
no
but
i
read
all
her
pieces
and
i
know
a
fellow
who
works
in
the
office
where
this
paper
is
printed
do
you
say
she
makes
a
good
living
out
of
stories
like
this
and
jo
looked
more
respectfully
at
the
agitated
group
and
thickly-sprinkled
exclamation-points
that
adorned
the
page
guess
she
does
she
knows
just
what
folks
like
and
gets
paid
well
for
writing
it
here
the
lecture
began
but
jo
heard
very
little
of
it
for
while
prof
sands
was
prosing
away
about
belzoni
cheops
scarabei
and
hieroglyphics
she
was
covertly
taking
down
the
address
of
the
paper
and
boldly
resolving
to
try
for
the
hundred-dollar
prize
offered
in
its
columns
for
a
sensational
story
by
the
time
the
lecture
ended
and
the
audience
awoke
she
had
built
up
a
splendid
fortune
for
herself
not
the
first
founded
upon
paper
and
was
already
deep
in
the
concoction
of
her
story
being
unable
to
decide
whether
the
duel
should
come
before
the
elopement
or
after
the
murder
she
said
nothing
of
her
plan
at
home
but
fell
to
work
next
day
much
to
the
disquiet
of
her
mother
who
always
looked
a
little
anxious
when
genius
took
to
burning
jo
had
never
tried
this
style
before
contenting
herself
with
very
mild
romances
for
the
spread
eagle
her
theatrical
experience
and
miscellaneous
reading
were
of
service
now
for
they
gave
her
some
idea
of
dramatic
effect
and
supplied
plot
language
and
costumes
her
story
was
as
full
of
desperation
and
despair
as
her
limited
acquaintance
with
those
uncomfortable
emotions
enabled
her
to
make
it
and
having
located
it
in
lisbon
she
wound
up
with
an
earthquake
as
a
striking
and
appropriate
_dénouement_
the
manuscript
was
privately
despatched
accompanied
by
a
note
modestly
saying
that
if
the
tale
didn't
get
the
prize
which
the
writer
hardly
dared
expect
she
would
be
very
glad
to
receive
any
sum
it
might
be
considered
worth
six
weeks
is
a
long
time
to
wait
and
a
still
longer
time
for
a
girl
to
keep
a
secret
but
jo
did
both
and
was
just
beginning
to
give
up
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
her
manuscript
again
when
a
letter
arrived
which
almost
took
her
breath
away
for
on
opening
it
a
check
for
a
hundred
dollars
fell
into
her
lap
for
a
minute
she
stared
at
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
snake
then
she
read
her
letter
and
began
to
cry
if
the
amiable
gentleman
who
wrote
that
kindly
note
could
have
known
what
intense
happiness
he
was
giving
a
fellow-creature
i
think
he
would
devote
his
leisure
hours
if
he
has
any
to
that
amusement
for
jo
valued
the
letter
more
than
the
money
because
it
was
encouraging
and
after
years
of
effort
it
was
_so_
pleasant
to
find
that
she
had
learned
to
do
something
though
it
was
only
to
write
a
sensation
story
illustration
a
check
for
one
hundred
dollars
a
prouder
young
woman
was
seldom
seen
than
she
when
having
composed
herself
she
electrified
the
family
by
appearing
before
them
with
the
letter
in
one
hand
the
check
in
the
other
announcing
that
she
had
won
the
prize
of
course
there
was
a
great
jubilee
and
when
the
story
came
every
one
read
and
praised
it
though
after
her
father
had
told
her
that
the
language
was
good
the
romance
fresh
and
hearty
and
the
tragedy
quite
thrilling
he
shook
his
head
and
said
in
his
unworldly
way,--
you
can
do
better
than
this
jo
aim
at
the
highest
and
never
mind
the
money
_i_
think
the
money
is
the
best
part
of
it
what
_will_
you
do
with
such
a
fortune
asked
amy
regarding
the
magic
slip
of
paper
with
a
reverential
eye
send
beth
and
mother
to
the
seaside
for
a
month
or
two
answered
jo
promptly
oh
how
splendid
no
i
can't
do
it
dear
it
would
be
so
selfish
cried
beth
who
had
clapped
her
thin
hands
and
taken
a
long
breath
as
if
pining
for
fresh
ocean-breezes
then
stopped
herself
and
motioned
away
the
check
which
her
sister
waved
before
her
ah
but
you
shall
go
i've
set
my
heart
on
it
that's
what
i
tried
for
and
that's
why
i
succeeded
i
never
get
on
when
i
think
of
myself
alone
so
it
will
help
me
to
work
for
you
don't
you
see
besides
marmee
needs
the
change
and
she
won't
leave
you
so
you
_must_
go
won't
it
be
fun
to
see
you
come
home
plump
and
rosy
again
hurrah
for
dr
jo
who
always
cures
her
patients
to
the
sea
side
they
went
after
much
discussion
and
though
beth
didn't
come
home
as
plump
and
rosy
as
could
be
desired
she
was
much
better
while
mrs
march
declared
she
felt
ten
years
younger
so
jo
was
satisfied
with
the
investment
of
her
prize
money
and
fell
to
work
with
a
cheery
spirit
bent
on
earning
more
of
those
delightful
checks
she
did
earn
several
that
year
and
began
to
feel
herself
a
power
in
the
house
for
by
the
magic
of
a
pen
her
rubbish
turned
into
comforts
for
them
all
the
duke's
daughter
paid
the
butcher's
bill
a
phantom
hand
put
down
a
new
carpet
and
the
curse
of
the
coventrys
proved
the
blessing
of
the
marches
in
the
way
of
groceries
and
gowns
wealth
is
certainly
a
most
desirable
thing
but
poverty
has
its
sunny
side
and
one
of
the
sweet
uses
of
adversity
is
the
genuine
satisfaction
which
comes
from
hearty
work
of
head
or
hand
and
to
the
inspiration
of
necessity
we
owe
half
the
wise
beautiful
and
useful
blessings
of
the
world
jo
enjoyed
a
taste
of
this
satisfaction
and
ceased
to
envy
richer
girls
taking
great
comfort
in
the
knowledge
that
she
could
supply
her
own
wants
and
need
ask
no
one
for
a
penny
little
notice
was
taken
of
her
stories
but
they
found
a
market
and
encouraged
by
this
fact
she
resolved
to
make
a
bold
stroke
for
fame
and
fortune
having
copied
her
novel
for
the
fourth
time
read
it
to
all
her
confidential
friends
and
submitted
it
with
fear
and
trembling
to
three
publishers
she
at
last
disposed
of
it
on
condition
that
she
would
cut
it
down
one
third
and
omit
all
the
parts
which
she
particularly
admired
now
i
must
either
bundle
it
back
into
my
tin-kitchen
to
mould
pay
for
printing
it
myself
or
chop
it
up
to
suit
purchasers
and
get
what
i
can
for
it
fame
is
a
very
good
thing
to
have
in
the
house
but
cash
is
more
convenient
so
i
wish
to
take
the
sense
of
the
meeting
on
this
important
subject
said
jo
calling
a
family
council
don't
spoil
your
book
my
girl
for
there
is
more
in
it
than
you
know
and
the
idea
is
well
worked
out
let
it
wait
and
ripen
was
her
father's
advice
and
he
practised
as
he
preached
having
waited
patiently
thirty
years
for
fruit
of
his
own
to
ripen
and
being
in
no
haste
to
gather
it
even
now
when
it
was
sweet
and
mellow
it
seems
to
me
that
jo
will
profit
more
by
making
the
trial
than
by
waiting
said
mrs
march
criticism
is
the
best
test
of
such
work
for
it
will
show
her
both
unsuspected
merits
and
faults
and
help
her
to
do
better
next
time
we
are
too
partial
but
the
praise
and
blame
of
outsiders
will
prove
useful
even
if
she
gets
but
little
money
yes
said
jo
knitting
her
brows
that's
just
it
i've
been
fussing
over
the
thing
so
long
i
really
don't
know
whether
it's
good
bad
or
indifferent
it
will
be
a
great
help
to
have
cool
impartial
persons
take
a
look
at
it
and
tell
me
what
they
think
of
it
i
wouldn't
leave
out
a
word
of
it
you'll
spoil
it
if
you
do
for
the
interest
of
the
story
is
more
in
the
minds
than
in
the
actions
of
the
people
and
it
will
be
all
a
muddle
if
you
don't
explain
as
you
go
on
said
meg
who
firmly
believed
that
this
book
was
the
most
remarkable
novel
ever
written
but
mr
allen
says
'leave
out
the
explanations
make
it
brief
and
dramatic
and
let
the
characters
tell
the
story,'
interrupted
jo
turning
to
the
publisher's
note
do
as
he
tells
you
he
knows
what
will
sell
and
we
don't
make
a
good
popular
book
and
get
as
much
money
as
you
can
by
and
by
when
you've
got
a
name
you
can
afford
to
digress
and
have
philosophical
and
metaphysical
people
in
your
novels
said
amy
who
took
a
strictly
practical
view
of
the
subject
well
said
jo
laughing
if
my
people
_are_
'philosophical
and
metaphysical,'
it
isn't
my
fault
for
i
know
nothing
about
such
things
except
what
i
hear
father
say
sometimes
if
i've
got
some
of
his
wise
ideas
jumbled
up
with
my
romance
so
much
the
better
for
me
now
beth
what
do
you
say
i
should
so
like
to
see
it
printed
_soon_
was
all
beth
said
and
smiled
in
saying
it
but
there
was
an
unconscious
emphasis
on
the
last
word
and
a
wistful
look
in
the
eyes
that
never
lost
their
childlike
candor
which
chilled
jo's
heart
for
a
minute
with
a
foreboding
fear
and
decided
her
to
make
her
little
venture
soon
so
with
spartan
firmness
the
young
authoress
laid
her
first-born
on
her
table
and
chopped
it
up
as
ruthlessly
as
any
ogre
in
the
hope
of
pleasing
every
one
she
took
every
one's
advice
and
like
the
old
man
and
his
donkey
in
the
fable
suited
nobody
her
father
liked
the
metaphysical
streak
which
had
unconsciously
got
into
it
so
that
was
allowed
to
remain
though
she
had
her
doubts
about
it
her
mother
thought
that
there
_was_
a
trifle
too
much
description
out
therefore
it
nearly
all
came
and
with
it
many
necessary
links
in
the
story
meg
admired
the
tragedy
so
jo
piled
up
the
agony
to
suit
her
while
amy
objected
to
the
fun
and
with
the
best
intentions
in
life
jo
quenched
the
sprightly
scenes
which
relieved
the
sombre
character
of
the
story
then
to
complete
the
ruin
she
cut
it
down
one
third
and
confidingly
sent
the
poor
little
romance
like
a
picked
robin
out
into
the
big
busy
world
to
try
its
fate
well
it
was
printed
and
she
got
three
hundred
dollars
for
it
likewise
plenty
of
praise
and
blame
both
so
much
greater
than
she
expected
that
she
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
bewilderment
from
which
it
took
her
some
time
to
recover
you
said
mother
that
criticism
would
help
me
but
how
can
it
when
it's
so
contradictory
that
i
don't
know
whether
i've
written
a
promising
book
or
broken
all
the
ten
commandments
cried
poor
jo
turning
over
a
heap
of
notices
the
perusal
of
which
filled
her
with
pride
and
joy
one
minute
wrath
and
dire
dismay
the
next
this
man
says
'an
exquisite
book
full
of
truth
beauty
and
earnestness
all
is
sweet
pure
and
healthy,'
continued
the
perplexed
authoress
the
next
'the
theory
of
the
book
is
bad
full
of
morbid
fancies
spiritualistic
ideas
and
unnatural
characters.'
now
as
i
had
no
theory
of
any
kind
don't
believe
in
spiritualism
and
copied
my
characters
from
life
i
don't
see
how
this
critic
_can_
be
right
another
says
'it's
one
of
the
best
american
novels
which
has
appeared
for
years'
i
know
better
than
that
and
the
next
asserts
that
'though
it
is
original
and
written
with
great
force
and
feeling
it
is
a
dangerous
book.'
'tisn't
some
make
fun
of
it
some
over-praise
and
nearly
all
insist
that
i
had
a
deep
theory
to
expound
when
i
only
wrote
it
for
the
pleasure
and
the
money
i
wish
i'd
printed
it
whole
or
not
at
all
for
i
do
hate
to
be
so
misjudged
her
family
and
friends
administered
comfort
and
commendation
liberally
yet
it
was
a
hard
time
for
sensitive
high-spirited
jo
who
meant
so
well
and
had
apparently
done
so
ill
but
it
did
her
good
for
those
whose
opinion
had
real
value
gave
her
the
criticism
which
is
an
author's
best
education
and
when
the
first
soreness
was
over
she
could
laugh
at
her
poor
little
book
yet
believe
in
it
still
and
feel
herself
the
wiser
and
stronger
for
the
buffeting
she
had
received
not
being
a
genius
like
keats
it
won't
kill
me
she
said
stoutly
and
i've
got
the
joke
on
my
side
after
all
for
the
parts
that
were
taken
straight
out
of
real
life
are
denounced
as
impossible
and
absurd
and
the
scenes
that
i
made
up
out
of
my
own
silly
head
are
pronounced
'charmingly
natural
tender
and
true.'
so
i'll
comfort
myself
with
that
and
when
i'm
ready
i'll
up
again
and
take
another

domestic
experiences
xxviii
domestic
experiences
like
most
other
young
matrons
meg
began
her
married
life
with
the
determination
to
be
a
model
housekeeper
john
should
find
home
a
paradise
he
should
always
see
a
smiling
face
should
fare
sumptuously
every
day
and
never
know
the
loss
of
a
button
she
brought
so
much
love
energy
and
cheerfulness
to
the
work
that
she
could
not
but
succeed
in
spite
of
some
obstacles
her
paradise
was
not
a
tranquil
one
for
the
little
woman
fussed
was
over-anxious
to
please
and
bustled
about
like
a
true
martha
cumbered
with
many
cares
she
was
too
tired
sometimes
even
to
smile
john
grew
dyspeptic
after
a
course
of
dainty
dishes
and
ungratefully
demanded
plain
fare
as
for
buttons
she
soon
learned
to
wonder
where
they
went
to
shake
her
head
over
the
carelessness
of
men
and
to
threaten
to
make
him
sew
them
on
himself
and
then
see
if
_his_
work
would
stand
impatient
tugs
and
clumsy
fingers
any
better
than
hers
they
were
very
happy
even
after
they
discovered
that
they
couldn't
live
on
love
alone
john
did
not
find
meg's
beauty
diminished
though
she
beamed
at
him
from
behind
the
familiar
coffee-pot
nor
did
meg
miss
any
of
the
romance
from
the
daily
parting
when
her
husband
followed
up
his
kiss
with
the
tender
inquiry
shall
i
send
home
veal
or
mutton
for
dinner
darling
the
little
house
ceased
to
be
a
glorified
bower
but
it
became
a
home
and
the
young
couple
soon
felt
that
it
was
a
change
for
the
better
at
first
they
played
keep-house
and
frolicked
over
it
like
children
then
john
took
steadily
to
business
feeling
the
cares
of
the
head
of
a
family
upon
his
shoulders
and
meg
laid
by
her
cambric
wrappers
put
on
a
big
apron
and
fell
to
work
as
before
said
with
more
energy
than
discretion
while
the
cooking
mania
lasted
she
went
through
mrs
cornelius's
receipt
book
as
if
it
were
a
mathematical
exercise
working
out
the
problems
with
patience
and
care
sometimes
her
family
were
invited
in
to
help
eat
up
a
too
bounteous
feast
of
successes
or
lotty
would
be
privately
despatched
with
a
batch
of
failures
which
were
to
be
concealed
from
all
eyes
in
the
convenient
stomachs
of
the
little
hummels
an
evening
with
john
over
the
account-books
usually
produced
a
temporary
lull
in
the
culinary
enthusiasm
and
a
frugal
fit
would
ensue
during
which
the
poor
man
was
put
through
a
course
of
bread-pudding
hash
and
warmed-over
coffee
which
tried
his
soul
although
he
bore
it
with
praiseworthy
fortitude
before
the
golden
mean
was
found
however
meg
added
to
her
domestic
possessions
what
young
couples
seldom
get
on
long
without,--a
family
jar
fired
with
a
housewifely
wish
to
see
her
store-room
stocked
with
home-made
preserves
she
undertook
to
put
up
her
own
currant
jelly
john
was
requested
to
order
home
a
dozen
or
so
of
little
pots
and
an
extra
quantity
of
sugar
for
their
own
currants
were
ripe
and
were
to
be
attended
to
at
once
as
john
firmly
believed
that
my
wife
was
equal
to
anything
and
took
a
natural
pride
in
her
skill
he
resolved
that
she
should
be
gratified
and
their
only
crop
of
fruit
laid
by
in
a
most
pleasing
form
for
winter
use
home
came
four
dozen
delightful
little
pots
half
a
barrel
of
sugar
and
a
small
boy
to
pick
the
currants
for
her
with
her
pretty
hair
tucked
into
a
little
cap
arms
bared
to
the
elbow
and
a
checked
apron
which
had
a
coquettish
look
in
spite
of
the
bib
the
young
housewife
fell
to
work
feeling
no
doubts
about
her
success
for
hadn't
she
seen
hannah
do
it
hundreds
of
times
the
array
of
pots
rather
amazed
her
at
first
but
john
was
so
fond
of
jelly
and
the
nice
little
jars
would
look
so
well
on
the
top
shelf
that
meg
resolved
to
fill
them
all
and
spent
a
long
day
picking
boiling
straining
and
fussing
over
her
jelly
she
did
her
best
she
asked
advice
of
mrs
cornelius
she
racked
her
brain
to
remember
what
hannah
did
that
she
had
left
undone
she
reboiled
resugared
and
restrained
but
that
dreadful
stuff
wouldn't
_jell_
she
longed
to
run
home
bib
and
all
and
ask
mother
to
lend
a
hand
but
john
and
she
had
agreed
that
they
would
never
annoy
any
one
with
their
private
worries
experiments
or
quarrels
they
had
laughed
over
that
last
word
as
if
the
idea
it
suggested
was
a
most
preposterous
one
but
they
had
held
to
their
resolve
and
whenever
they
could
get
on
without
help
they
did
so
and
no
one
interfered
for
mrs
march
had
advised
the
plan
so
meg
wrestled
alone
with
the
refractory
sweetmeats
all
that
hot
summer
day
and
at
five
o'clock
sat
down
in
her
topsy-turvy
kitchen
wrung
her
bedaubed
hands
lifted
up
her
voice
and
wept
now
in
the
first
flush
of
the
new
life
she
had
often
said,--
my
husband
shall
always
feel
free
to
bring
a
friend
home
whenever
he
likes
i
shall
always
be
prepared
there
shall
be
no
flurry
no
scolding
no
discomfort
but
a
neat
house
a
cheerful
wife
and
a
good
dinner
john
dear
never
stop
to
ask
my
leave
invite
whom
you
please
and
be
sure
of
a
welcome
from
me
how
charming
that
was
to
be
sure
john
quite
glowed
with
pride
to
hear
her
say
it
and
felt
what
a
blessed
thing
it
was
to
have
a
superior
wife
but
although
they
had
had
company
from
time
to
time
it
never
happened
to
be
unexpected
and
meg
had
never
had
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
herself
till
now
it
always
happens
so
in
this
vale
of
tears
there
is
an
inevitability
about
such
things
which
we
can
only
wonder
at
deplore
and
bear
as
we
best
can
if
john
had
not
forgotten
all
about
the
jelly
it
really
would
have
been
unpardonable
in
him
to
choose
that
day
of
all
the
days
in
the
year
to
bring
a
friend
home
to
dinner
unexpectedly
congratulating
himself
that
a
handsome
repast
had
been
ordered
that
morning
feeling
sure
that
it
would
be
ready
to
the
minute
and
indulging
in
pleasant
anticipations
of
the
charming
effect
it
would
produce
when
his
pretty
wife
came
running
out
to
meet
him
he
escorted
his
friend
to
his
mansion
with
the
irrepressible
satisfaction
of
a
young
host
and
husband
it
is
a
world
of
disappointments
as
john
discovered
when
he
reached
the
dove-cote
the
front
door
usually
stood
hospitably
open
now
it
was
not
only
shut
but
locked
and
yesterday's
mud
still
adorned
the
steps
the
parlor-windows
were
closed
and
curtained
no
picture
of
the
pretty
wife
sewing
on
the
piazza
in
white
with
a
distracting
little
bow
in
her
hair
or
a
bright-eyed
hostess
smiling
a
shy
welcome
as
she
greeted
her
guest
nothing
of
the
sort
for
not
a
soul
appeared
but
a
sanguinary-looking
boy
asleep
under
the
currant-bushes
i'm
afraid
something
has
happened
step
into
the
garden
scott
while
i
look
up
mrs
brooke
said
john
alarmed
at
the
silence
and
solitude
round
the
house
he
hurried
led
by
a
pungent
smell
of
burnt
sugar
and
mr
scott
strolled
after
him
with
a
queer
look
on
his
face
he
paused
discreetly
at
a
distance
when
brooke
disappeared
but
he
could
both
see
and
hear
and
being
a
bachelor
enjoyed
the
prospect
mightily
in
the
kitchen
reigned
confusion
and
despair
one
edition
of
jelly
was
trickled
from
pot
to
pot
another
lay
upon
the
floor
and
a
third
was
burning
gayly
on
the
stove
lotty
with
teutonic
phlegm
was
calmly
eating
bread
and
currant
wine
for
the
jelly
was
still
in
a
hopelessly
liquid
state
while
mrs
brooke
with
her
apron
over
her
head
sat
sobbing
dismally
my
dearest
girl
what
is
the
matter
cried
john
rushing
in
with
awful
visions
of
scalded
hands
sudden
news
of
affliction
and
secret
consternation
at
the
thought
of
the
guest
in
the
garden
o
john
i
_am_
so
tired
and
hot
and
cross
and
worried
i've
been
at
it
till
i'm
all
worn
out
do
come
and
help
me
or
i
_shall_
die
and
the
exhausted
housewife
cast
herself
upon
his
breast
giving
him
a
sweet
welcome
in
every
sense
of
the
word
for
her
pinafore
had
been
baptized
at
the
same
time
as
the
floor
what
worries
you
dear
has
anything
dreadful
happened
asked
the
anxious
john
tenderly
kissing
the
crown
of
the
little
cap
which
was
all
askew
yes
sobbed
meg
despairingly
tell
me
quick
then
don't
cry
i
can
bear
anything
better
than
that
out
with
it
love
the--the
jelly
won't
jell
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do
john
brooke
laughed
then
as
he
never
dared
to
laugh
afterward
and
the
derisive
scott
smiled
involuntarily
as
he
heard
the
hearty
peal
which
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
poor
meg's
woe
is
that
all
fling
it
out
of
window
and
don't
bother
any
more
about
it
i'll
buy
you
quarts
if
you
want
it
but
for
heaven's
sake
don't
have
hysterics
for
i've
brought
jack
scott
home
to
dinner
and--
john
got
no
further
for
meg
cast
him
off
and
clasped
her
hands
with
a
tragic
gesture
as
she
fell
into
a
chair
exclaiming
in
a
tone
of
mingled
indignation
reproach
and
dismay,--
a
man
to
dinner
and
everything
in
a
mess
john
brooke
how
_could_
you
do
such
a
thing
hush
he's
in
the
garden
i
forgot
the
confounded
jelly
but
it
can't
be
helped
now
said
john
surveying
the
prospect
with
an
anxious
eye
you
ought
to
have
sent
word
or
told
me
this
morning
and
you
ought
to
have
remembered
how
busy
i
was
continued
meg
petulantly
for
even
turtle-doves
will
peck
when
ruffled
i
didn't
know
it
this
morning
and
there
was
no
time
to
send
word
for
i
met
him
on
the
way
out
i
never
thought
of
asking
leave
when
you
have
always
told
me
to
do
as
i
liked
i
never
tried
it
before
and
hang
me
if
i
ever
do
again
added
john
with
an
aggrieved
air
i
should
hope
not
take
him
away
at
once
i
can't
see
him
and
there
isn't
any
dinner
well
i
like
that
where's
the
beef
and
vegetables
i
sent
home
and
the
pudding
you
promised
cried
john
rushing
to
the
larder
i
hadn't
time
to
cook
anything
i
meant
to
dine
at
mother's
i'm
sorry
but
i
was
_so_
busy
and
meg's
tears
began
again
john
was
a
mild
man
but
he
was
human
and
after
a
long
day's
work
to
come
home
tired
hungry
and
hopeful
to
find
a
chaotic
house
an
empty
table
and
a
cross
wife
was
not
exactly
conducive
to
repose
of
mind
or
manner
he
restrained
himself
however
and
the
little
squall
would
have
blown
over
but
for
one
unlucky
word
it's
a
scrape
i
acknowledge
but
if
you
will
lend
a
hand
we'll
pull
through
and
have
a
good
time
yet
don't
cry
dear
but
just
exert
yourself
a
bit
and
knock
us
up
something
to
eat
we're
both
as
hungry
as
hunters
so
we
sha'n't
mind
what
it
is
give
us
the
cold
meat
and
bread
and
cheese
we
won't
ask
for
jelly
he
meant
it
for
a
good-natured
joke
but
that
one
word
sealed
his
fate
meg
thought
it
was
_too_
cruel
to
hint
about
her
sad
failure
and
the
last
atom
of
patience
vanished
as
he
spoke
you
must
get
yourself
out
of
the
scrape
as
you
can
i'm
too
used
up
to
'exert'
myself
for
any
one
it's
like
a
man
to
propose
a
bone
and
vulgar
bread
and
cheese
for
company
i
won't
have
anything
of
the
sort
in
my
house
take
that
scott
up
to
mother's
and
tell
him
i'm
away
sick
dead,--anything
i
won't
see
him
and
you
two
can
laugh
at
me
and
my
jelly
as
much
as
you
like
you
won't
have
anything
else
here
and
having
delivered
her
defiance
all
in
one
breath
meg
cast
away
her
pinafore
and
precipitately
left
the
field
to
bemoan
herself
in
her
own
room
what
those
two
creatures
did
in
her
absence
she
never
knew
but
mr
scott
was
not
taken
up
to
mother's
and
when
meg
descended
after
they
had
strolled
away
together
she
found
traces
of
a
promiscuous
lunch
which
filled
her
with
horror
lotty
reported
that
they
had
eaten
a
much
and
greatly
laughed
and
the
master
bid
her
throw
away
all
the
sweet
stuff
and
hide
the
pots
meg
longed
to
go
and
tell
mother
but
a
sense
of
shame
at
her
own
short-comings
of
loyalty
to
john
who
might
be
cruel
but
nobody
should
know
it
restrained
her
and
after
a
summary
clearing
up
she
dressed
herself
prettily
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
john
to
come
and
be
forgiven
unfortunately
john
didn't
come
not
seeing
the
matter
in
that
light
he
had
carried
it
off
as
a
good
joke
with
scott
excused
his
little
wife
as
well
as
he
could
and
played
the
host
so
hospitably
that
his
friend
enjoyed
the
impromptu
dinner
and
promised
to
come
again
but
john
was
angry
though
he
did
not
show
it
he
felt
that
meg
had
got
him
into
a
scrape
and
then
deserted
him
in
his
hour
of
need
it
wasn't
fair
to
tell
a
man
to
bring
folks
home
any
time
with
perfect
freedom
and
when
he
took
you
at
your
word
to
flame
up
and
blame
him
and
leave
him
in
the
lurch
to
be
laughed
at
or
pitied
no
by
george
it
wasn't
and
meg
must
know
it
he
had
fumed
inwardly
during
the
feast
but
when
the
flurry
was
over
and
he
strolled
home
after
seeing
scott
off
a
milder
mood
came
over
him
poor
little
thing
it
was
hard
upon
her
when
she
tried
so
heartily
to
please
me
she
was
wrong
of
course
but
then
she
was
young
i
must
be
patient
and
teach
her
he
hoped
she
had
not
gone
home--he
hated
gossip
and
interference
for
a
minute
he
was
ruffled
again
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
and
then
the
fear
that
meg
would
cry
herself
sick
softened
his
heart
and
sent
him
on
at
a
quicker
pace
resolving
to
be
calm
and
kind
but
firm
quite
firm
and
show
her
where
she
had
failed
in
her
duty
to
her
spouse
meg
likewise
resolved
to
be
calm
and
kind
but
firm
and
show
_him_
his
duty
she
longed
to
run
to
meet
him
and
beg
pardon
and
be
kissed
and
comforted
as
she
was
sure
of
being
but
of
course
she
did
nothing
of
the
sort
and
when
she
saw
john
coming
began
to
hum
quite
naturally
as
she
rocked
and
sewed
like
a
lady
of
leisure
in
her
best
parlor
john
was
a
little
disappointed
not
to
find
a
tender
niobe
but
feeling
that
his
dignity
demanded
the
first
apology
he
made
none
only
came
leisurely
in
and
laid
himself
upon
the
sofa
with
the
singularly
relevant
remark,--
we
are
going
to
have
a
new
moon
my
dear
i've
no
objection
was
meg's
equally
soothing
remark
a
few
other
topics
of
general
interest
were
introduced
by
mr
brooke
and
wet-blanketed
by
mrs
brooke
and
conversation
languished
john
went
to
one
window
unfolded
his
paper
and
wrapped
himself
in
it
figuratively
speaking
meg
went
to
the
other
window
and
sewed
as
if
new
rosettes
for
her
slippers
were
among
the
necessaries
of
life
neither
spoke
both
looked
quite
calm
and
firm
and
both
felt
desperately
uncomfortable
illustration
both
felt
desperately
uncomfortable
oh
dear
thought
meg
married
life
is
very
trying
and
does
need
infinite
patience
as
well
as
love
as
mother
says
the
word
mother
suggested
other
maternal
counsels
given
long
ago
and
received
with
unbelieving
protests
john
is
a
good
man
but
he
has
his
faults
and
you
must
learn
to
see
and
bear
with
them
remembering
your
own
he
is
very
decided
but
never
will
be
obstinate
if
you
reason
kindly
not
oppose
impatiently
he
is
very
accurate
and
particular
about
the
truth--a
good
trait
though
you
call
him
'fussy.'
never
deceive
him
by
look
or
word
meg
and
he
will
give
you
the
confidence
you
deserve
the
support
you
need
he
has
a
temper
not
like
ours,--one
flash
and
then
all
over,--but
the
white
still
anger
that
is
seldom
stirred
but
once
kindled
is
hard
to
quench
be
careful
very
careful
not
to
wake
this
anger
against
yourself
for
peace
and
happiness
depend
on
keeping
his
respect
watch
yourself
be
the
first
to
ask
pardon
if
you
both
err
and
guard
against
the
little
piques
misunderstandings
and
hasty
words
that
often
pave
the
way
for
bitter
sorrow
and
regret
these
words
came
back
to
meg
as
she
sat
sewing
in
the
sunset
especially
the
last
this
was
the
first
serious
disagreement
her
own
hasty
speeches
sounded
both
silly
and
unkind
as
she
recalled
them
her
own
anger
looked
childish
now
and
thoughts
of
poor
john
coming
home
to
such
a
scene
quite
melted
her
heart
she
glanced
at
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
he
did
not
see
them
she
put
down
her
work
and
got
up
thinking
i
_will_
be
the
first
to
say
'forgive
me,'
but
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
she
went
very
slowly
across
the
room
for
pride
was
hard
to
swallow
and
stood
by
him
but
he
did
not
turn
his
head
for
a
minute
she
felt
as
if
she
really
couldn't
do
it
then
came
the
thought
this
is
the
beginning
i'll
do
my
part
and
have
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
and
stooping
down
she
softly
kissed
her
husband
on
the
forehead
of
course
that
settled
it
the
penitent
kiss
was
better
than
a
world
of
words
and
john
had
her
on
his
knee
in
a
minute
saying
tenderly,--
it
was
too
bad
to
laugh
at
the
poor
little
jelly-pots
forgive
me
dear
i
never
will
again
but
he
did
oh
bless
you
yes
hundreds
of
times
and
so
did
meg
both
declaring
that
it
was
the
sweetest
jelly
they
ever
made
for
family
peace
was
preserved
in
that
little
family
jar
after
this
meg
had
mr
scott
to
dinner
by
special
invitation
and
served
him
up
a
pleasant
feast
without
a
cooked
wife
for
the
first
course
on
which
occasion
she
was
so
gay
and
gracious
and
made
everything
go
off
so
charmingly
that
mr
scott
told
john
he
was
a
happy
fellow
and
shook
his
head
over
the
hardships
of
bachelorhood
all
the
way
home
in
the
autumn
new
trials
and
experiences
came
to
meg
sallie
moffat
renewed
her
friendship
was
always
running
out
for
a
dish
of
gossip
at
the
little
house
or
inviting
that
poor
dear
to
come
in
and
spend
the
day
at
the
big
house
it
was
pleasant
for
in
dull
weather
meg
often
felt
lonely
all
were
busy
at
home
john
absent
till
night
and
nothing
to
do
but
sew
or
read
or
potter
about
so
it
naturally
fell
out
that
meg
got
into
the
way
of
gadding
and
gossiping
with
her
friend
seeing
sallie's
pretty
things
made
her
long
for
such
and
pity
herself
because
she
had
not
got
them
sallie
was
very
kind
and
often
offered
her
the
coveted
trifles
but
meg
declined
them
knowing
that
john
wouldn't
like
it
and
then
this
foolish
little
woman
went
and
did
what
john
disliked
infinitely
worse
she
knew
her
husband's
income
and
she
loved
to
feel
that
he
trusted
her
not
only
with
his
happiness
but
what
some
men
seem
to
value
more,--his
money
she
knew
where
it
was
was
free
to
take
what
she
liked
and
all
he
asked
was
that
she
should
keep
account
of
every
penny
pay
bills
once
a
month
and
remember
that
she
was
a
poor
man's
wife
till
now
she
had
done
well
been
prudent
and
exact
kept
her
little
account-books
neatly
and
showed
them
to
him
monthly
without
fear
but
that
autumn
the
serpent
got
into
meg's
paradise
and
tempted
her
like
many
a
modern
eve
not
with
apples
but
with
dress
meg
didn't
like
to
be
pitied
and
made
to
feel
poor
it
irritated
her
but
she
was
ashamed
to
confess
it
and
now
and
then
she
tried
to
console
herself
by
buying
something
pretty
so
that
sallie
needn't
think
she
had
to
economize
she
always
felt
wicked
after
it
for
the
pretty
things
were
seldom
necessaries
but
then
they
cost
so
little
it
wasn't
worth
worrying
about
so
the
trifles
increased
unconsciously
and
in
the
shopping
excursions
she
was
no
longer
a
passive
looker-on
but
the
trifles
cost
more
than
one
would
imagine
and
when
she
cast
up
her
accounts
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
sum
total
rather
scared
her
john
was
busy
that
month
and
left
the
bills
to
her
the
next
month
he
was
absent
but
the
third
he
had
a
grand
quarterly
settling
up
and
meg
never
forgot
it
a
few
days
before
she
had
done
a
dreadful
thing
and
it
weighed
upon
her
conscience
sallie
had
been
buying
silks
and
meg
longed
for
a
new
one,--just
a
handsome
light
one
for
parties
her
black
silk
was
so
common
and
thin
things
for
evening
wear
were
only
proper
for
girls
aunt
march
usually
gave
the
sisters
a
present
of
twenty-five
dollars
apiece
at
new
year
that
was
only
a
month
to
wait
and
here
was
a
lovely
violet
silk
going
at
a
bargain
and
she
had
the
money
if
she
only
dared
to
take
it
john
always
said
what
was
his
was
hers
but
would
he
think
it
right
to
spend
not
only
the
prospective
five-and-twenty
but
another
five-and-twenty
out
of
the
household
fund
that
was
the
question
sallie
had
urged
her
to
do
it
had
offered
to
loan
the
money
and
with
the
best
intentions
in
life
had
tempted
meg
beyond
her
strength
in
an
evil
moment
the
shopman
held
up
the
lovely
shimmering
folds
and
said
a
bargain
i
assure
you
ma'am
she
answered
i'll
take
it
and
it
was
cut
off
and
paid
for
and
sallie
had
exulted
and
she
had
laughed
as
if
it
were
a
thing
of
no
consequence
and
driven
away
feeling
as
if
she
had
stolen
something
and
the
police
were
after
her
illustration
a
bargain
i
assure
you
ma'am
when
she
got
home
she
tried
to
assuage
the
pangs
of
remorse
by
spreading
forth
the
lovely
silk
but
it
looked
less
silvery
now
didn't
become
her
after
all
and
the
words
fifty
dollars
seemed
stamped
like
a
pattern
down
each
breadth
she
put
it
away
but
it
haunted
her
not
delightfully
as
a
new
dress
should
but
dreadfully
like
the
ghost
of
a
folly
that
was
not
easily
laid
when
john
got
out
his
books
that
night
meg's
heart
sank
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
married
life
she
was
afraid
of
her
husband
the
kind
brown
eyes
looked
as
if
they
could
be
stern
and
though
he
was
unusually
merry
she
fancied
he
had
found
her
out
but
didn't
mean
to
let
her
know
it
the
house-bills
were
all
paid
the
books
all
in
order
john
had
praised
her
and
was
undoing
the
old
pocket-book
which
they
called
the
bank
when
meg
knowing
that
it
was
quite
empty
stopped
his
hand
saying
nervously,--
you
haven't
seen
my
private
expense
book
yet
john
never
asked
to
see
it
but
she
always
insisted
on
his
doing
so
and
used
to
enjoy
his
masculine
amazement
at
the
queer
things
women
wanted
and
made
him
guess
what
piping
was
demand
fiercely
the
meaning
of
a
hug-me-tight
or
wonder
how
a
little
thing
composed
of
three
rosebuds
a
bit
of
velvet
and
a
pair
of
strings
could
possibly
be
a
bonnet
and
cost
five
or
six
dollars
that
night
he
looked
as
if
he
would
like
the
fun
of
quizzing
her
figures
and
pretending
to
be
horrified
at
her
extravagance
as
he
often
did
being
particularly
proud
of
his
prudent
wife
the
little
book
was
brought
slowly
out
and
laid
down
before
him
meg
got
behind
his
chair
under
pretence
of
smoothing
the
wrinkles
out
of
his
tired
forehead
and
standing
there
she
said
with
her
panic
increasing
with
every
word,--
john
dear
i'm
ashamed
to
show
you
my
book
for
i've
really
been
dreadfully
extravagant
lately
i
go
about
so
much
i
must
have
things
you
know
and
sallie
advised
my
getting
it
so
i
did
and
my
new-year's
money
will
partly
pay
for
it
but
i
was
sorry
after
i'd
done
it
for
i
knew
you'd
think
it
wrong
in
me
john
laughed
and
drew
her
round
beside
him
saying
good-humoredly
don't
go
and
hide
i
won't
beat
you
if
you
_have_
got
a
pair
of
killing
boots
i'm
rather
proud
of
my
wife's
feet
and
don't
mind
if
she
does
pay
eight
or
nine
dollars
for
her
boots
if
they
are
good
ones
that
had
been
one
of
her
last
trifles
and
john's
eye
had
fallen
on
it
as
he
spoke
oh
what
_will_
he
say
when
he
comes
to
that
awful
fifty
dollars
thought
meg
with
a
shiver
it's
worse
than
boots
it's
a
silk
dress
she
said
with
the
calmness
of
desperation
for
she
wanted
the
worst
over
well
dear
what
is
the
'dem'd
total,'
as
mr
mantalini
says
that
didn't
sound
like
john
and
she
knew
he
was
looking
up
at
her
with
the
straightforward
look
that
she
had
always
been
ready
to
meet
and
answer
with
one
as
frank
till
now
she
turned
the
page
and
her
head
at
the
same
time
pointing
to
the
sum
which
would
have
been
bad
enough
without
the
fifty
but
which
was
appalling
to
her
with
that
added
for
a
minute
the
room
was
very
still
then
john
said
slowly,--but
she
could
feel
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
express
no
displeasure,--
well
i
don't
know
that
fifty
is
much
for
a
dress
with
all
the
furbelows
and
notions
you
have
to
have
to
finish
it
off
these
days
it
isn't
made
or
trimmed
sighed
meg
faintly
for
a
sudden
recollection
of
the
cost
still
to
be
incurred
quite
overwhelmed
her
twenty-five
yards
of
silk
seems
a
good
deal
to
cover
one
small
woman
but
i've
no
doubt
my
wife
will
look
as
fine
as
ned
moffat's
when
she
gets
it
on
said
john
dryly
i
know
you
are
angry
john
but
i
can't
help
it
i
don't
mean
to
waste
your
money
and
i
didn't
think
those
little
things
would
count
up
so
i
can't
resist
them
when
i
see
sallie
buying
all
she
wants
and
pitying
me
because
i
don't
i
try
to
be
contented
but
it
is
hard
and
i'm
tired
of
being
poor
the
last
words
were
spoken
so
low
she
thought
he
did
not
hear
them
but
he
did
and
they
wounded
him
deeply
for
he
had
denied
himself
many
pleasures
for
meg's
sake
she
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
out
the
minute
she
had
said
it
for
john
pushed
the
books
away
and
got
up
saying
with
a
little
quiver
in
his
voice
i
was
afraid
of
this
i
do
my
best
meg
if
he
had
scolded
her
or
even
shaken
her
it
would
not
have
broken
her
heart
like
those
few
words
she
ran
to
him
and
held
him
close
crying
with
repentant
tears
o
john
my
dear
kind
hard-working
boy
i
didn't
mean
it
it
was
so
wicked
so
untrue
and
ungrateful
how
could
i
say
it
oh
how
could
i
say
it
he
was
very
kind
forgave
her
readily
and
did
not
utter
one
reproach
but
meg
knew
that
she
had
done
and
said
a
thing
which
would
not
be
forgotten
soon
although
he
might
never
allude
to
it
again
she
had
promised
to
love
him
for
better
for
worse
and
then
she
his
wife
had
reproached
him
with
his
poverty
after
spending
his
earnings
recklessly
it
was
dreadful
and
the
worst
of
it
was
john
went
on
so
quietly
afterward
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
except
that
he
stayed
in
town
later
and
worked
at
night
when
she
had
gone
to
cry
herself
to
sleep
a
week
of
remorse
nearly
made
meg
sick
and
the
discovery
that
john
had
countermanded
the
order
for
his
new
great-coat
reduced
her
to
a
state
of
despair
which
was
pathetic
to
behold
he
had
simply
said
in
answer
to
her
surprised
inquiries
as
to
the
change
i
can't
afford
it
my
dear
meg
said
no
more
but
a
few
minutes
after
he
found
her
in
the
hall
with
her
face
buried
in
the
old
great-coat
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
they
had
a
long
talk
that
night
and
meg
learned
to
love
her
husband
better
for
his
poverty
because
it
seemed
to
have
made
a
man
of
him
given
him
the
strength
and
courage
to
fight
his
own
way
and
taught
him
a
tender
patience
with
which
to
bear
and
comfort
the
natural
longings
and
failures
of
those
he
loved
next
day
she
put
her
pride
in
her
pocket
went
to
sallie
told
the
truth
and
asked
her
to
buy
the
silk
as
a
favor
the
good-natured
mrs
moffat
willingly
did
so
and
had
the
delicacy
not
to
make
her
a
present
of
it
immediately
afterward
then
meg
ordered
home
the
great-coat
and
when
john
arrived
she
put
it
on
and
asked
him
how
he
liked
her
new
silk
gown
one
can
imagine
what
answer
he
made
how
he
received
his
present
and
what
a
blissful
state
of
things
ensued
john
came
home
early
meg
gadded
no
more
and
that
great-coat
was
put
on
in
the
morning
by
a
very
happy
husband
and
taken
off
at
night
by
a
most
devoted
little
wife
so
the
year
rolled
round
and
at
midsummer
there
came
to
meg
a
new
experience,--the
deepest
and
tenderest
of
a
woman's
life
laurie
came
sneaking
into
the
kitchen
of
the
dove-cote
one
saturday
with
an
excited
face
and
was
received
with
the
clash
of
cymbals
for
hannah
clapped
her
hands
with
a
saucepan
in
one
and
the
cover
in
the
other
how's
the
little
mamma
where
is
everybody
why
didn't
you
tell
me
before
i
came
home
began
laurie
in
a
loud
whisper
happy
as
a
queen
the
dear
every
soul
of
'em
is
upstairs
a
worshipin'
we
didn't
want
no
hurrycanes
round
now
you
go
into
the
parlor
and
i'll
send
'em
down
to
you
with
which
somewhat
involved
reply
hannah
vanished
chuckling
ecstatically
presently
jo
appeared
proudly
bearing
a
flannel
bundle
laid
forth
upon
a
large
pillow
jo's
face
was
very
sober
but
her
eyes
twinkled
and
there
was
an
odd
sound
in
her
voice
of
repressed
emotion
of
some
sort
shut
your
eyes
and
hold
out
your
arms
she
said
invitingly
laurie
backed
precipitately
into
a
corner
and
put
his
hands
behind
him
with
an
imploring
gesture
no
thank
you
i'd
rather
not
i
shall
drop
it
or
smash
it
as
sure
as
fate
then
you
sha'n't
see
your
nevvy
said
jo
decidedly
turning
as
if
to
go
i
will
i
will
only
you
must
be
responsible
for
damages
and
obeying
orders
laurie
heroically
shut
his
eyes
while
something
was
put
into
his
arms
a
peal
of
laughter
from
jo
amy
mrs
march
hannah
and
john
caused
him
to
open
them
the
next
minute
to
find
himself
invested
with
two
babies
instead
of
one
illustration
laurie
heroically
shut
his
eyes
while
something
was
put
into
his
arms
no
wonder
they
laughed
for
the
expression
of
his
face
was
droll
enough
to
convulse
a
quaker
as
he
stood
and
stared
wildly
from
the
unconscious
innocents
to
the
hilarious
spectators
with
such
dismay
that
jo
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
screamed
twins
by
jupiter
was
all
he
said
for
a
minute
then
turning
to
the
women
with
an
appealing
look
that
was
comically
piteous
he
added
take
'em
quick
somebody
i'm
going
to
laugh
and
i
shall
drop
'em
john
rescued
his
babies
and
marched
up
and
down
with
one
on
each
arm
as
if
already
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
baby-tending
while
laurie
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
it's
the
best
joke
of
the
season
isn't
it
i
wouldn't
have
you
told
for
i
set
my
heart
on
surprising
you
and
i
flatter
myself
i've
done
it
said
jo
when
she
got
her
breath
i
never
was
more
staggered
in
my
life
isn't
it
fun
are
they
boys
what
are
you
going
to
name
them
let's
have
another
look
hold
me
up
jo
for
upon
my
life
it's
one
too
many
for
me
returned
laurie
regarding
the
infants
with
the
air
of
a
big
benevolent
newfoundland
looking
at
a
pair
of
infantile
kittens
boy
and
girl
aren't
they
beauties
said
the
proud
papa
beaming
upon
the
little
red
squirmers
as
if
they
were
unfledged
angels
most
remarkable
children
i
ever
saw
which
is
which
and
laurie
bent
like
a
well-sweep
to
examine
the
prodigies
amy
put
a
blue
ribbon
on
the
boy
and
a
pink
on
the
girl
french
fashion
so
you
can
always
tell
besides
one
has
blue
eyes
and
one
brown
kiss
them
uncle
teddy
said
wicked
jo
i'm
afraid
they
mightn't
like
it
began
laurie
with
unusual
timidity
in
such
matters
of
course
they
will
they
are
used
to
it
now
do
it
this
minute
sir
commanded
jo
fearing
he
might
propose
a
proxy
laurie
screwed
up
his
face
and
obeyed
with
a
gingerly
peck
at
each
little
cheek
that
produced
another
laugh
and
made
the
babies
squeal
there
i
knew
they
didn't
like
it
that's
the
boy
see
him
kick
he
hits
out
with
his
fists
like
a
good
one
now
then
young
brooke
pitch
into
a
man
of
your
own
size
will
you
cried
laurie
delighted
with
a
poke
in
the
face
from
a
tiny
fist
flapping
aimlessly
about
he's
to
be
named
john
laurence
and
the
girl
margaret
after
mother
and
grandmother
we
shall
call
her
daisy
so
as
not
to
have
two
megs
and
i
suppose
the
mannie
will
be
jack
unless
we
find
a
better
name
said
amy
with
aunt-like
interest
name
him
demijohn
and
call
him
'demi'
for
short
said
laurie
daisy
and
demi,--just
the
thing
i
_knew_
teddy
would
do
it
cried
jo
clapping
her
hands
teddy
certainly
had
done
it
that
time
for
the
babies
were
daisy
and
demi
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
xxix
calls
illustration
calls
come
jo
it's
time
for
what
you
don't
mean
to
say
you
have
forgotten
that
you
promised
to
make
half
a
dozen
calls
with
me
to-day
i've
done
a
good
many
rash
and
foolish
things
in
my
life
but
i
don't
think
i
ever
was
mad
enough
to
say
i'd
make
six
calls
in
one
day
when
a
single
one
upsets
me
for
a
week
yes
you
did
it
was
a
bargain
between
us
i
was
to
finish
the
crayon
of
beth
for
you
and
you
were
to
go
properly
with
me
and
return
our
neighbors'
visits
if
it
was
fair--that
was
in
the
bond
and
i
stand
to
the
letter
of
my
bond
shylock
there
is
a
pile
of
clouds
in
the
east
it's
_not_
fair
and
i
don't
go
now
that's
shirking
it's
a
lovely
day
no
prospect
of
rain
and
you
pride
yourself
on
keeping
promises
so
be
honorable
come
and
do
your
duty
and
then
be
at
peace
for
another
six
months
at
that
minute
jo
was
particularly
absorbed
in
dressmaking
for
she
was
mantua-maker
general
to
the
family
and
took
especial
credit
to
herself
because
she
could
use
a
needle
as
well
as
a
pen
it
was
very
provoking
to
be
arrested
in
the
act
of
a
first
trying-on
and
ordered
out
to
make
calls
in
her
best
array
on
a
warm
july
day
she
hated
calls
of
the
formal
sort
and
never
made
any
till
amy
compelled
her
with
a
bargain
bribe
or
promise
in
the
present
instance
there
was
no
escape
and
having
clashed
her
scissors
rebelliously
while
protesting
that
she
smelt
thunder
she
gave
in
put
away
her
work
and
taking
up
her
hat
and
gloves
with
an
air
of
resignation
told
amy
the
victim
was
ready
jo
march
you
are
perverse
enough
to
provoke
a
saint
you
don't
intend
to
make
calls
in
that
state
i
hope
cried
amy
surveying
her
with
amazement
why
not
i'm
neat
and
cool
and
comfortable
quite
proper
for
a
dusty
walk
on
a
warm
day
if
people
care
more
for
my
clothes
than
they
do
for
me
i
don't
wish
to
see
them
you
can
dress
for
both
and
be
as
elegant
as
you
please
it
pays
for
you
to
be
fine
it
doesn't
for
me
and
furbelows
only
worry
me
oh
dear
sighed
amy
now
she's
in
a
contrary
fit
and
will
drive
me
distracted
before
i
can
get
her
properly
ready
i'm
sure
it's
no
pleasure
to
me
to
go
to-day
but
it's
a
debt
we
owe
society
and
there's
no
one
to
pay
it
but
you
and
me
i'll
do
anything
for
you
jo
if
you'll
only
dress
yourself
nicely
and
come
and
help
me
do
the
civil
you
can
talk
so
well
look
so
aristocratic
in
your
best
things
and
behave
so
beautifully
if
you
try
that
i'm
proud
of
you
i'm
afraid
to
go
alone
do
come
and
take
care
of
me
you're
an
artful
little
puss
to
flatter
and
wheedle
your
cross
old
sister
in
that
way
the
idea
of
my
being
aristocratic
and
well-bred
and
your
being
afraid
to
go
anywhere
alone
i
don't
know
which
is
the
most
absurd
well
i'll
go
if
i
must
and
do
my
best
you
shall
be
commander
of
the
expedition
and
i'll
obey
blindly
will
that
satisfy
you
said
jo
with
a
sudden
change
from
perversity
to
lamb-like
submission
you're
a
perfect
cherub
now
put
on
all
your
best
things
and
i'll
tell
you
how
to
behave
at
each
place
so
that
you
will
make
a
good
impression
i
want
people
to
like
you
and
they
would
if
you'd
only
try
to
be
a
little
more
agreeable
do
your
hair
the
pretty
way
and
put
the
pink
rose
in
your
bonnet
it's
becoming
and
you
look
too
sober
in
your
plain
suit
take
your
light
gloves
and
the
embroidered
handkerchief
we'll
stop
at
meg's
and
borrow
her
white
sunshade
and
then
you
can
have
my
dove-colored
one
while
amy
dressed
she
issued
her
orders
and
jo
obeyed
them
not
without
entering
her
protest
however
for
she
sighed
as
she
rustled
into
her
new
organdie
frowned
darkly
at
herself
as
she
tied
her
bonnet
strings
in
an
irreproachable
bow
wrestled
viciously
with
pins
as
she
put
on
her
collar
wrinkled
up
her
features
generally
as
she
shook
out
the
handkerchief
whose
embroidery
was
as
irritating
to
her
nose
as
the
present
mission
was
to
her
feelings
and
when
she
had
squeezed
her
hands
into
tight
gloves
with
three
buttons
and
a
tassel
as
the
last
touch
of
elegance
she
turned
to
amy
with
an
imbecile
expression
of
countenance
saying
meekly,--
i'm
perfectly
miserable
but
if
you
consider
me
presentable
i
die
happy
you
are
highly
satisfactory
turn
slowly
round
and
let
me
get
a
careful
view
jo
revolved
and
amy
gave
a
touch
here
and
there
then
fell
back
with
her
head
on
one
side
observing
graciously
yes
you'll
do
your
head
is
all
i
could
ask
for
that
white
bonnet
_with_
the
rose
is
quite
ravishing
hold
back
your
shoulders
and
carry
your
hands
easily
no
matter
if
your
gloves
do
pinch
there's
one
thing
you
can
do
well
jo
that
is
wear
a
shawl--i
can't
but
it's
very
nice
to
see
you
and
i'm
so
glad
aunt
march
gave
you
that
lovely
one
it's
simple
but
handsome
and
those
folds
over
the
arm
are
really
artistic
is
the
point
of
my
mantle
in
the
middle
and
have
i
looped
my
dress
evenly
i
like
to
show
my
boots
for
my
feet
_are_
pretty
though
my
nose
isn't
you
are
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
forever
said
jo
looking
through
her
hand
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
at
the
blue
feather
against
the
gold
hair
am
i
to
drag
my
best
dress
through
the
dust
or
loop
it
up
please
ma'am
hold
it
up
when
you
walk
but
drop
it
in
the
house
the
sweeping
style
suits
you
best
and
you
must
learn
to
trail
your
skirts
gracefully
you
haven't
half
buttoned
one
cuff
do
it
at
once
you'll
never
look
finished
if
you
are
not
careful
about
the
little
details
for
they
make
up
the
pleasing
whole
jo
sighed
and
proceeded
to
burst
the
buttons
off
her
glove
in
doing
up
her
cuff
but
at
last
both
were
ready
and
sailed
away
looking
as
pretty
as
picters
hannah
said
as
she
hung
out
of
the
upper
window
to
watch
them
now
jo
dear
the
chesters
consider
themselves
very
elegant
people
so
i
want
you
to
put
on
your
best
deportment
don't
make
any
of
your
abrupt
remarks
or
do
anything
odd
will
you
just
be
calm
cool
and
quiet,--that's
safe
and
ladylike
and
you
can
easily
do
it
for
fifteen
minutes
said
amy
as
they
approached
the
first
place
having
borrowed
the
white
parasol
and
been
inspected
by
meg
with
a
baby
on
each
arm
let
me
see
'calm
cool
and
quiet,'--yes
i
think
i
can
promise
that
i've
played
the
part
of
a
prim
young
lady
on
the
stage
and
i'll
try
it
off
my
powers
are
great
as
you
shall
see
so
be
easy
in
your
mind
my
child
amy
looked
relieved
but
naughty
jo
took
her
at
her
word
for
during
the
first
call
she
sat
with
every
limb
gracefully
composed
every
fold
correctly
draped
calm
as
a
summer
sea
cool
as
a
snow-bank
and
as
silent
as
a
sphinx
in
vain
mrs
chester
alluded
to
her
charming
novel
and
the
misses
chester
introduced
parties
picnics
the
opera
and
the
fashions
each
and
all
were
answered
by
a
smile
a
bow
and
a
demure
yes
or
no
with
the
chill
on
in
vain
amy
telegraphed
the
word
talk
tried
to
draw
her
out
and
administered
covert
pokes
with
her
foot
jo
sat
as
if
blandly
unconscious
of
it
all
with
deportment
like
maud's
face
icily
regular
splendidly
null
what
a
haughty
uninteresting
creature
that
oldest
miss
march
is
was
the
unfortunately
audible
remark
of
one
of
the
ladies
as
the
door
closed
upon
their
guests
jo
laughed
noiselessly
all
through
the
hall
but
amy
looked
disgusted
at
the
failure
of
her
instructions
and
very
naturally
laid
the
blame
upon
jo
how
could
you
mistake
me
so
i
merely
meant
you
to
be
properly
dignified
and
composed
and
you
made
yourself
a
perfect
stock
and
stone
try
to
be
sociable
at
the
lambs'
gossip
as
other
girls
do
and
be
interested
in
dress
and
flirtations
and
whatever
nonsense
comes
up
they
move
in
the
best
society
are
valuable
persons
for
us
to
know
and
i
wouldn't
fail
to
make
a
good
impression
there
for
anything
i'll
be
agreeable
i'll
gossip
and
giggle
and
have
horrors
and
raptures
over
any
trifle
you
like
i
rather
enjoy
this
and
now
i'll
imitate
what
is
called
'a
charming
girl;'
i
can
do
it
for
i
have
may
chester
as
a
model
and
i'll
improve
upon
her
see
if
the
lambs
don't
say
'what
a
lively
nice
creature
that
jo
march
is!'
amy
felt
anxious
as
well
she
might
for
when
jo
turned
freakish
there
was
no
knowing
where
she
would
stop
amy's
face
was
a
study
when
she
saw
her
sister
skim
into
the
next
drawing-room
kiss
all
the
young
ladies
with
effusion
beam
graciously
upon
the
young
gentlemen
and
join
in
the
chat
with
a
spirit
which
amazed
the
beholder
amy
was
taken
possession
of
by
mrs
lamb
with
whom
she
was
a
favorite
and
forced
to
hear
a
long
account
of
lucretia's
last
attack
while
three
delightful
young
gentlemen
hovered
near
waiting
for
a
pause
when
they
might
rush
in
and
rescue
her
so
situated
she
was
powerless
to
check
jo
who
seemed
possessed
by
a
spirit
of
mischief
and
talked
away
as
volubly
as
the
old
lady
a
knot
of
heads
gathered
about
her
and
amy
strained
her
ears
to
hear
what
was
going
on
for
broken
sentences
filled
her
with
alarm
round
eyes
and
uplifted
hands
tormented
her
with
curiosity
and
frequent
peals
of
laughter
made
her
wild
to
share
the
fun
one
may
imagine
her
suffering
on
overhearing
fragments
of
this
sort
of
conversation:--
she
rides
splendidly,--who
taught
her
no
one
she
used
to
practise
mounting
holding
the
reins
and
sitting
straight
on
an
old
saddle
in
a
tree
now
she
rides
anything
for
she
doesn't
know
what
fear
is
and
the
stable-man
lets
her
have
horses
cheap
because
she
trains
them
to
carry
ladies
so
well
she
has
such
a
passion
for
it
i
often
tell
her
if
everything
else
fails
she
can
be
a
horse-breaker
and
get
her
living
so
at
this
awful
speech
amy
contained
herself
with
difficulty
for
the
impression
was
being
given
that
she
was
rather
a
fast
young
lady
which
was
her
especial
aversion
but
what
could
she
do
for
the
old
lady
was
in
the
middle
of
her
story
and
long
before
it
was
done
jo
was
off
again
making
more
droll
revelations
and
committing
still
more
fearful
blunders
yes
amy
was
in
despair
that
day
for
all
the
good
beasts
were
gone
and
of
three
left
one
was
lame
one
blind
and
the
other
so
balky
that
you
had
to
put
dirt
in
his
mouth
before
he
would
start
nice
animal
for
a
pleasure
party
wasn't
it
which
did
she
choose
asked
one
of
the
laughing
gentlemen
who
enjoyed
the
subject
none
of
them
she
heard
of
a
young
horse
at
the
farmhouse
over
the
river
and
though
a
lady
had
never
ridden
him
she
resolved
to
try
because
he
was
handsome
and
spirited
her
struggles
were
really
pathetic
there
was
no
one
to
bring
the
horse
to
the
saddle
so
she
took
the
saddle
to
the
horse
my
dear
creature
she
actually
rowed
it
over
the
river
put
it
on
her
head
and
marched
up
to
the
barn
to
the
utter
amazement
of
the
old
man
illustration
she
took
the
saddle
to
the
horse
did
she
ride
the
horse
of
course
she
did
and
had
a
capital
time
i
expected
to
see
her
brought
home
in
fragments
but
she
managed
him
perfectly
and
was
the
life
of
the
party
well
i
call
that
plucky
and
young
mr
lamb
turned
an
approving
glance
upon
amy
wondering
what
his
mother
could
be
saying
to
make
the
girl
look
so
red
and
uncomfortable
she
was
still
redder
and
more
uncomfortable
a
moment
after
when
a
sudden
turn
in
the
conversation
introduced
the
subject
of
dress
one
of
the
young
ladies
asked
jo
where
she
got
the
pretty
drab
hat
she
wore
to
the
picnic
and
stupid
jo
instead
of
mentioning
the
place
where
it
was
bought
two
years
ago
must
needs
answer
with
unnecessary
frankness
oh
amy
painted
it
you
can't
buy
those
soft
shades
so
we
paint
ours
any
color
we
like
it's
a
great
comfort
to
have
an
artistic
sister
isn't
that
an
original
idea
cried
miss
lamb
who
found
jo
great
fun
that's
nothing
compared
to
some
of
her
brilliant
performances
there's
nothing
the
child
can't
do
why
she
wanted
a
pair
of
blue
boots
for
sallie's
party
so
she
just
painted
her
soiled
white
ones
the
loveliest
shade
of
sky-blue
you
ever
saw
and
they
looked
exactly
like
satin
added
jo
with
an
air
of
pride
in
her
sister's
accomplishments
that
exasperated
amy
till
she
felt
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
throw
her
card-case
at
her
we
read
a
story
of
yours
the
other
day
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
observed
the
elder
miss
lamb
wishing
to
compliment
the
literary
lady
who
did
not
look
the
character
just
then
it
must
be
confessed
any
mention
of
her
works
always
had
a
bad
effect
upon
jo
who
either
grew
rigid
and
looked
offended
or
changed
the
subject
with
a
_brusque_
remark
as
now
sorry
you
could
find
nothing
better
to
read
i
write
that
rubbish
because
it
sells
and
ordinary
people
like
it
are
you
going
to
new
york
this
winter
as
miss
lamb
had
enjoyed
the
story
this
speech
was
not
exactly
grateful
or
complimentary
the
minute
it
was
made
jo
saw
her
mistake
but
fearing
to
make
the
matter
worse
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
for
her
to
make
the
first
move
toward
departure
and
did
so
with
an
abruptness
that
left
three
people
with
half-finished
sentences
in
their
mouths
amy
we
_must_
go
_good_-by
dear
_do_
come
and
see
us
we
are
_pining_
for
a
visit
i
don't
dare
to
ask
_you_
mr
lamb
but
if
you
_should_
come
i
don't
think
i
shall
have
the
heart
to
send
you
away
jo
said
this
with
such
a
droll
imitation
of
may
chester's
gushing
style
that
amy
got
out
of
the
room
as
rapidly
as
possible
feeling
a
strong
desire
to
laugh
and
cry
at
the
same
time
didn't
i
do
that
well
asked
jo
with
a
satisfied
air
as
they
walked
away
nothing
could
have
been
worse
was
amy's
crushing
reply
what
possessed
you
to
tell
those
stories
about
my
saddle
and
the
hats
and
boots
and
all
the
rest
of
it
why
it's
funny
and
amuses
people
they
know
we
are
poor
so
it's
no
use
pretending
that
we
have
grooms
buy
three
or
four
hats
a
season
and
have
things
as
easy
and
fine
as
they
do
you
needn't
go
and
tell
them
all
our
little
shifts
and
expose
our
poverty
in
that
perfectly
unnecessary
way
you
haven't
a
bit
of
proper
pride
and
never
will
learn
when
to
hold
your
tongue
and
when
to
speak
said
amy
despairingly
poor
jo
looked
abashed
and
silently
chafed
the
end
of
her
nose
with
the
stiff
handkerchief
as
if
performing
a
penance
for
her
misdemeanors
how
shall
i
behave
here
she
asked
as
they
approached
the
third
mansion
just
as
you
please
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
was
amy's
short
answer
then
i'll
enjoy
myself
the
boys
are
at
home
and
we'll
have
a
comfortable
time
goodness
knows
i
need
a
little
change
for
elegance
has
a
bad
effect
upon
my
constitution
returned
jo
gruffly
being
disturbed
by
her
failures
to
suit
an
enthusiastic
welcome
from
three
big
boys
and
several
pretty
children
speedily
soothed
her
ruffled
feelings
and
leaving
amy
to
entertain
the
hostess
and
mr
tudor
who
happened
to
be
calling
likewise
jo
devoted
herself
to
the
young
folks
and
found
the
change
refreshing
she
listened
to
college
stories
with
deep
interest
caressed
pointers
and
poodles
without
a
murmur
agreed
heartily
that
tom
brown
was
a
brick
regardless
of
the
improper
form
of
praise
and
when
one
lad
proposed
a
visit
to
his
turtle-tank
she
went
with
an
alacrity
which
caused
mamma
to
smile
upon
her
as
that
motherly
lady
settled
the
cap
which
was
left
in
a
ruinous
condition
by
filial
hugs
bear-like
but
affectionate
and
dearer
to
her
than
the
most
faultless
_coiffure_
from
the
hands
of
an
inspired
frenchwoman
leaving
her
sister
to
her
own
devices
amy
proceeded
to
enjoy
herself
to
her
heart's
content
mr
tudor's
uncle
had
married
an
english
lady
who
was
third
cousin
to
a
living
lord
and
amy
regarded
the
whole
family
with
great
respect
for
in
spite
of
her
american
birth
and
breeding
she
possessed
that
reverence
for
titles
which
haunts
the
best
of
us,--that
unacknowledged
loyalty
to
the
early
faith
in
kings
which
set
the
most
democratic
nation
under
the
sun
in
a
ferment
at
the
coming
of
a
royal
yellow-haired
laddie
some
years
ago
and
which
still
has
something
to
do
with
the
love
the
young
country
bears
the
old
like
that
of
a
big
son
for
an
imperious
little
mother
who
held
him
while
she
could
and
let
him
go
with
a
farewell
scolding
when
he
rebelled
but
even
the
satisfaction
of
talking
with
a
distant
connection
of
the
british
nobility
did
not
render
amy
forgetful
of
time
and
when
the
proper
number
of
minutes
had
passed
she
reluctantly
tore
herself
from
this
aristocratic
society
and
looked
about
for
jo
fervently
hoping
that
her
incorrigible
sister
would
not
be
found
in
any
position
which
should
bring
disgrace
upon
the
name
of
march
illustration
it
might
have
been
worse
it
might
have
been
worse
but
amy
considered
it
bad
for
jo
sat
on
the
grass
with
an
encampment
of
boys
about
her
and
a
dirty-footed
dog
reposing
on
the
skirt
of
her
state
and
festival
dress
as
she
related
one
of
laurie's
pranks
to
her
admiring
audience
one
small
child
was
poking
turtles
with
amy's
cherished
parasol
a
second
was
eating
gingerbread
over
jo's
best
bonnet
and
a
third
playing
ball
with
her
gloves
but
all
were
enjoying
themselves
and
when
jo
collected
her
damaged
property
to
go
her
escort
accompanied
her
begging
her
to
come
again
it
was
such
fun
to
hear
about
laurie's
larks
capital
boys
aren't
they
i
feel
quite
young
and
brisk
again
after
that
said
jo
strolling
along
with
her
hands
behind
her
partly
from
habit
partly
to
conceal
the
bespattered
parasol
why
do
you
always
avoid
mr
tudor
asked
amy
wisely
refraining
from
any
comment
upon
jo's
dilapidated
appearance
don't
like
him
he
puts
on
airs
snubs
his
sisters
worries
his
father
and
doesn't
speak
respectfully
of
his
mother
laurie
says
he
is
fast
and
_i_
don't
consider
him
a
desirable
acquaintance
so
i
let
him
alone
you
might
treat
him
civilly
at
least
you
gave
him
a
cool
nod
and
just
now
you
bowed
and
smiled
in
the
politest
way
to
tommy
chamberlain
whose
father
keeps
a
grocery
store
if
you
had
just
reversed
the
nod
and
the
bow
it
would
have
been
right
said
amy
reprovingly
no
it
wouldn't
returned
perverse
jo
i
neither
like
respect
nor
admire
tudor
though
his
grandfather's
uncle's
nephew's
niece
_was_
third
cousin
to
a
lord
tommy
is
poor
and
bashful
and
good
and
very
clever
i
think
well
of
him
and
like
to
show
that
i
do
for
he
_is_
a
gentleman
in
spite
of
the
brown-paper
parcels
it's
no
use
trying
to
argue
with
you
began
amy
not
the
least
my
dear
interrupted
jo
so
let
us
look
amiable
and
drop
a
card
here
as
the
kings
are
evidently
out
for
which
i'm
deeply
grateful
the
family
card-case
having
done
its
duty
the
girls
walked
on
and
jo
uttered
another
thanksgiving
on
reaching
the
fifth
house
and
being
told
that
the
young
ladies
were
engaged
now
let
us
go
home
and
never
mind
aunt
march
to-day
we
can
run
down
there
any
time
and
it's
really
a
pity
to
trail
through
the
dust
in
our
best
bibs
and
tuckers
when
we
are
tired
and
cross
speak
for
yourself
if
you
please
aunt
likes
to
have
us
pay
her
the
compliment
of
coming
in
style
and
making
a
formal
call
it's
a
little
thing
to
do
but
it
gives
her
pleasure
and
i
don't
believe
it
will
hurt
your
things
half
so
much
as
letting
dirty
dogs
and
clumping
boys
spoil
them
stoop
down
and
let
me
take
the
crumbs
off
of
your
bonnet
what
a
good
girl
you
are
amy
said
jo
with
a
repentant
glance
from
her
own
damaged
costume
to
that
of
her
sister
which
was
fresh
and
spotless
still
i
wish
it
was
as
easy
for
me
to
do
little
things
to
please
people
as
it
is
for
you
i
think
of
them
but
it
takes
too
much
time
to
do
them
so
i
wait
for
a
chance
to
confer
a
great
favor
and
let
the
small
ones
slip
but
they
tell
best
in
the
end
i
fancy
amy
smiled
and
was
mollified
at
once
saying
with
a
maternal
air,--
women
should
learn
to
be
agreeable
particularly
poor
ones
for
they
have
no
other
way
of
repaying
the
kindnesses
they
receive
if
you'd
remember
that
and
practise
it
you'd
be
better
liked
than
i
am
because
there
is
more
of
you
i'm
a
crotchety
old
thing
and
always
shall
be
but
i'm
willing
to
own
that
you
are
right
only
it's
easier
for
me
to
risk
my
life
for
a
person
than
to
be
pleasant
to
him
when
i
don't
feel
like
it
it's
a
great
misfortune
to
have
such
strong
likes
and
dislikes
isn't
it
it's
a
greater
not
to
be
able
to
hide
them
i
don't
mind
saying
that
i
don't
approve
of
tudor
any
more
than
you
do
but
i'm
not
called
upon
to
tell
him
so
neither
are
you
and
there
is
no
use
in
making
yourself
disagreeable
because
he
is
but
i
think
girls
ought
to
show
when
they
disapprove
of
young
men
and
how
can
they
do
it
except
by
their
manners
preaching
does
not
do
any
good
as
i
know
to
my
sorrow
since
i've
had
teddy
to
manage
but
there
are
many
little
ways
in
which
i
can
influence
him
without
a
word
and
i
say
we
_ought_
to
do
it
to
others
if
we
can
teddy
is
a
remarkable
boy
and
can't
be
taken
as
a
sample
of
other
boys
said
amy
in
a
tone
of
solemn
conviction
which
would
have
convulsed
the
remarkable
boy
if
he
had
heard
it
if
we
were
belles
or
women
of
wealth
and
position
we
might
do
something
perhaps
but
for
us
to
frown
at
one
set
of
young
gentlemen
because
we
don't
approve
of
them
and
smile
upon
another
set
because
we
do
wouldn't
have
a
particle
of
effect
and
we
should
only
be
considered
odd
and
puritanical
so
we
are
to
countenance
things
and
people
which
we
detest
merely
because
we
are
not
belles
and
millionaires
are
we
that's
a
nice
sort
of
morality
i
can't
argue
about
it
i
only
know
that
it's
the
way
of
the
world
and
people
who
set
themselves
against
it
only
get
laughed
at
for
their
pains
i
don't
like
reformers
and
i
hope
you
will
never
try
to
be
one
i
do
like
them
and
i
shall
be
one
if
i
can
for
in
spite
of
the
laughing
the
world
would
never
get
on
without
them
we
can't
agree
about
that
for
you
belong
to
the
old
set
and
i
to
the
new
you
will
get
on
the
best
but
i
shall
have
the
liveliest
time
of
it
i
should
rather
enjoy
the
brickbats
and
hooting
i
think
well
compose
yourself
now
and
don't
worry
aunt
with
your
new
ideas
i'll
try
not
to
but
i'm
always
possessed
to
burst
out
with
some
particularly
blunt
speech
or
revolutionary
sentiment
before
her
it's
my
doom
and
i
can't
help
it
they
found
aunt
carrol
with
the
old
lady
both
absorbed
in
some
very
interesting
subject
but
they
dropped
it
as
the
girls
came
in
with
a
conscious
look
which
betrayed
that
they
had
been
talking
about
their
nieces
jo
was
not
in
a
good
humor
and
the
perverse
fit
returned
but
amy
who
had
virtuously
done
her
duty
kept
her
temper
and
pleased
everybody
was
in
a
most
angelic
frame
of
mind
this
amiable
spirit
was
felt
at
once
and
both
the
aunts
my
deared
her
affectionately
looking
what
they
afterwards
said
emphatically,--"that
child
improves
every
day
are
you
going
to
help
about
the
fair
dear
asked
mrs
carrol
as
amy
sat
down
beside
her
with
the
confiding
air
elderly
people
like
so
well
in
the
young
yes
aunt
mrs
chester
asked
me
if
i
would
and
i
offered
to
tend
a
table
as
i
have
nothing
but
my
time
to
give
i'm
not
put
in
jo
decidedly
i
hate
to
be
patronized
and
the
chesters
think
it's
a
great
favor
to
allow
us
to
help
with
their
highly
connected
fair
i
wonder
you
consented
amy
they
only
want
you
to
work
i
am
willing
to
work
it's
for
the
freedmen
as
well
as
the
chesters
and
i
think
it
very
kind
of
them
to
let
me
share
the
labor
and
the
fun
patronage
does
not
trouble
me
when
it
is
well
meant
quite
right
and
proper
i
like
your
grateful
spirit
my
dear
it's
a
pleasure
to
help
people
who
appreciate
our
efforts
some
do
not
and
that
is
trying
observed
aunt
march
looking
over
her
spectacles
at
jo
who
sat
apart
rocking
herself
with
a
somewhat
morose
expression
illustration
the
call
at
aunt
march's
if
jo
had
only
known
what
a
great
happiness
was
wavering
in
the
balance
for
one
of
them
she
would
have
turned
dovelike
in
a
minute
but
unfortunately
we
don't
have
windows
in
our
breasts
and
cannot
see
what
goes
on
in
the
minds
of
our
friends
better
for
us
that
we
cannot
as
a
general
thing
but
now
and
then
it
would
be
such
a
comfort
such
a
saving
of
time
and
temper
by
her
next
speech
jo
deprived
herself
of
several
years
of
pleasure
and
received
a
timely
lesson
in
the
art
of
holding
her
tongue
i
don't
like
favors
they
oppress
and
make
me
feel
like
a
slave
i'd
rather
do
everything
for
myself
and
be
perfectly
independent
ahem
coughed
aunt
carrol
softly
with
a
look
at
aunt
march
i
told
you
so
said
aunt
march
with
a
decided
nod
to
aunt
carrol
mercifully
unconscious
of
what
she
had
done
jo
sat
with
her
nose
in
the
air
and
a
revolutionary
aspect
which
was
anything
but
inviting
do
you
speak
french
dear
asked
mrs
carrol
laying
her
hand
on
amy's
pretty
well
thanks
to
aunt
march
who
lets
esther
talk
to
me
as
often
as
i
like
replied
amy
with
a
grateful
look
which
caused
the
old
lady
to
smile
affably
how
are
you
about
languages
asked
mrs
carrol
of
jo
don't
know
a
word
i'm
very
stupid
about
studying
anything
can't
bear
french
it's
such
a
slippery
silly
sort
of
language
was
the
_brusque_
reply
another
look
passed
between
the
ladies
and
aunt
march
said
to
amy
you
are
quite
strong
and
well
now
dear
i
believe
eyes
don't
trouble
you
any
more
do
they
not
at
all
thank
you
ma'am
i'm
very
well
and
mean
to
do
great
things
next
winter
so
that
i
may
be
ready
for
rome
whenever
that
joyful
time
arrives
good
girl
you
deserve
to
go
and
i'm
sure
you
will
some
day
said
aunt
march
with
an
approving
pat
on
the
head
as
amy
picked
up
her
ball
for
her
cross-patch
draw
the
latch
sit
by
the
fire
and
spin
squalled
polly
bending
down
from
his
perch
on
the
back
of
her
chair
to
peep
into
jo's
face
with
such
a
comical
air
of
impertinent
inquiry
that
it
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
most
observing
bird
said
the
old
lady
come
and
take
a
walk
my
dear
cried
polly
hopping
toward
the
china-closet
with
a
look
suggestive
of
lump-sugar
thank
you
i
will
come
amy
and
jo
brought
the
visit
to
an
end
feeling
more
strongly
than
ever
that
calls
did
have
a
bad
effect
upon
her
constitution
she
shook
hands
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
but
amy
kissed
both
the
aunts
and
the
girls
departed
leaving
behind
them
the
impression
of
shadow
and
sunshine
which
impression
caused
aunt
march
to
say
as
they
vanished,--
you'd
better
do
it
mary
i'll
supply
the
money
and
aunt
carrol
to
reply
decidedly
i
certainly
will
if
her
father
and
mother
consent

xxx
consequences
mrs
chester's
fair
was
so
very
elegant
and
select
that
it
was
considered
a
great
honor
by
the
young
ladies
of
the
neighborhood
to
be
invited
to
take
a
table
and
every
one
was
much
interested
in
the
matter
amy
was
asked
but
jo
was
not
which
was
fortunate
for
all
parties
as
her
elbows
were
decidedly
akimbo
at
this
period
of
her
life
and
it
took
a
good
many
hard
knocks
to
teach
her
how
to
get
on
easily
the
haughty
uninteresting
creature
was
let
severely
alone
but
amy's
talent
and
taste
were
duly
complimented
by
the
offer
of
the
art-table
and
she
exerted
herself
to
prepare
and
secure
appropriate
and
valuable
contributions
to
it
everything
went
on
smoothly
till
the
day
before
the
fair
opened
then
there
occurred
one
of
the
little
skirmishes
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
avoid
when
some
five
and
twenty
women
old
and
young
with
all
their
private
piques
and
prejudices
try
to
work
together
may
chester
was
rather
jealous
of
amy
because
the
latter
was
a
greater
favorite
than
herself
and
just
at
this
time
several
trifling
circumstances
occurred
to
increase
the
feeling
amy's
dainty
pen-and-ink
work
entirely
eclipsed
may's
painted
vases,--that
was
one
thorn
then
the
all-conquering
tudor
had
danced
four
times
with
amy
at
a
late
party
and
only
once
with
may,--that
was
thorn
number
two
but
the
chief
grievance
that
rankled
in
her
soul
and
gave
her
an
excuse
for
her
unfriendly
conduct
was
a
rumor
which
some
obliging
gossip
had
whispered
to
her
that
the
march
girls
had
made
fun
of
her
at
the
lambs'
all
the
blame
of
this
should
have
fallen
upon
jo
for
her
naughty
imitation
had
been
too
lifelike
to
escape
detection
and
the
frolicsome
lambs
had
permitted
the
joke
to
escape
no
hint
of
this
had
reached
the
culprits
however
and
amy's
dismay
can
be
imagined
when
the
very
evening
before
the
fair
as
she
was
putting
the
last
touches
to
her
pretty
table
mrs
chester
who
of
course
resented
the
supposed
ridicule
of
her
daughter
said
in
a
bland
tone
but
with
a
cold
look,--
i
find
dear
that
there
is
some
feeling
among
the
young
ladies
about
my
giving
this
table
to
any
one
but
my
girls
as
this
is
the
most
prominent
and
some
say
the
most
attractive
table
of
all
and
they
are
the
chief
getters-up
of
the
fair
it
is
thought
best
for
them
to
take
this
place
i'm
sorry
but
i
know
you
are
too
sincerely
interested
in
the
cause
to
mind
a
little
personal
disappointment
and
you
shall
have
another
table
if
you
like
mrs
chester
had
fancied
beforehand
that
it
would
be
easy
to
deliver
this
little
speech
but
when
the
time
came
she
found
it
rather
difficult
to
utter
it
naturally
with
amy's
unsuspicious
eyes
looking
straight
at
her
full
of
surprise
and
trouble
amy
felt
that
there
was
something
behind
this
but
could
not
guess
what
and
said
quietly
feeling
hurt
and
showing
that
she
did,--
perhaps
you
had
rather
i
took
no
table
at
all
now
my
dear
don't
have
any
ill
feeling
i
beg
it's
merely
a
matter
of
expediency
you
see
my
girls
will
naturally
take
the
lead
and
this
table
is
considered
their
proper
place
_i_
think
it
very
appropriate
to
you
and
feel
very
grateful
for
your
efforts
to
make
it
so
pretty
but
we
must
give
up
our
private
wishes
of
course
and
i
will
see
that
you
have
a
good
place
elsewhere
wouldn't
you
like
the
flower-table
the
little
girls
undertook
it
but
they
are
discouraged
you
could
make
a
charming
thing
of
it
and
the
flower-table
is
always
attractive
you
know
especially
to
gentlemen
added
may
with
a
look
which
enlightened
amy
as
to
one
cause
of
her
sudden
fall
from
favor
she
colored
angrily
but
took
no
other
notice
of
that
girlish
sarcasm
and
answered
with
unexpected
amiability,--
it
shall
be
as
you
please
mrs
chester
i'll
give
up
my
place
here
at
once
and
attend
to
the
flowers
if
you
like
you
can
put
your
own
things
on
your
own
table
if
you
prefer
began
may
feeling
a
little
conscience-stricken
as
she
looked
at
the
pretty
racks
the
painted
shells
and
quaint
illuminations
amy
had
so
carefully
made
and
so
gracefully
arranged
she
meant
it
kindly
but
amy
mistook
her
meaning
and
said
quickly,--
oh
certainly
if
they
are
in
your
way
and
sweeping
her
contributions
into
her
apron
pell-mell
she
walked
off
feeling
that
herself
and
her
works
of
art
had
been
insulted
past
forgiveness
now
she's
mad
oh
dear
i
wish
i
hadn't
asked
you
to
speak
mamma
said
may
looking
disconsolately
at
the
empty
spaces
on
her
table
girls'
quarrels
are
soon
over
returned
her
mother
feeling
a
trifle
ashamed
of
her
own
part
in
this
one
as
well
she
might
the
little
girls
hailed
amy
and
her
treasures
with
delight
which
cordial
reception
somewhat
soothed
her
perturbed
spirit
and
she
fell
to
work
determined
to
succeed
florally
if
she
could
not
artistically
but
everything
seemed
against
her
it
was
late
and
she
was
tired
every
one
was
too
busy
with
their
own
affairs
to
help
her
and
the
little
girls
were
only
hindrances
for
the
dears
fussed
and
chattered
like
so
many
magpies
making
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
their
artless
efforts
to
preserve
the
most
perfect
order
the
evergreen
arch
wouldn't
stay
firm
after
she
got
it
up
but
wiggled
and
threatened
to
tumble
down
on
her
head
when
the
hanging
baskets
were
filled
her
best
tile
got
a
splash
of
water
which
left
a
sepia
tear
on
the
cupid's
cheek
she
bruised
her
hands
with
hammering
and
got
cold
working
in
a
draught
which
last
affliction
filled
her
with
apprehensions
for
the
morrow
any
girl-reader
who
has
suffered
like
afflictions
will
sympathize
with
poor
amy
and
wish
her
well
through
with
her
task
there
was
great
indignation
at
home
when
she
told
her
story
that
evening
her
mother
said
it
was
a
shame
but
told
her
she
had
done
right
beth
declared
she
wouldn't
go
to
the
fair
at
all
and
jo
demanded
why
she
didn't
take
all
her
pretty
things
and
leave
those
mean
people
to
get
on
without
her
because
they
are
mean
is
no
reason
why
i
should
be
i
hate
such
things
and
though
i
think
i've
a
right
to
be
hurt
i
don't
intend
to
show
it
they
will
feel
that
more
than
angry
speeches
or
huffy
actions
won't
they
marmee
that's
the
right
spirit
my
dear
a
kiss
for
a
blow
is
always
best
though
it's
not
very
easy
to
give
it
sometimes
said
her
mother
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
learned
the
difference
between
preaching
and
practising
in
spite
of
various
very
natural
temptations
to
resent
and
retaliate
amy
adhered
to
her
resolution
all
the
next
day
bent
on
conquering
her
enemy
by
kindness
she
began
well
thanks
to
a
silent
reminder
that
came
to
her
unexpectedly
but
most
opportunely
as
she
arranged
her
table
that
morning
while
the
little
girls
were
in
an
ante-room
filling
the
baskets
she
took
up
her
pet
production,--a
little
book
the
antique
cover
of
which
her
father
had
found
among
his
treasures
and
in
which
on
leaves
of
vellum
she
had
beautifully
illuminated
different
texts
as
she
turned
the
pages
rich
in
dainty
devices
with
very
pardonable
pride
her
eye
fell
upon
one
verse
that
made
her
stop
and
think
framed
in
a
brilliant
scroll-work
of
scarlet
blue
and
gold
with
little
spirits
of
good-will
helping
one
another
up
and
down
among
the
thorns
and
flowers
were
the
words
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
i
ought
but
i
don't
thought
amy
as
her
eye
went
from
the
bright
page
to
may's
discontented
face
behind
the
big
vases
that
could
not
hide
the
vacancies
her
pretty
work
had
once
filled
amy
stood
a
minute
turning
the
leaves
in
her
hand
reading
on
each
some
sweet
rebuke
for
all
heart-burnings
and
uncharitableness
of
spirit
many
wise
and
true
sermons
are
preached
us
every
day
by
unconscious
ministers
in
street
school
office
or
home
even
a
fair-table
may
become
a
pulpit
if
it
can
offer
the
good
and
helpful
words
which
are
never
out
of
season
amy's
conscience
preached
her
a
little
sermon
from
that
text
then
and
there
and
she
did
what
many
of
us
do
not
always
do,--took
the
sermon
to
heart
and
straightway
put
it
in
practice
a
group
of
girls
were
standing
about
may's
table
admiring
the
pretty
things
and
talking
over
the
change
of
saleswomen
they
dropped
their
voices
but
amy
knew
they
were
speaking
of
her
hearing
one
side
of
the
story
and
judging
accordingly
it
was
not
pleasant
but
a
better
spirit
had
come
over
her
and
presently
a
chance
offered
for
proving
it
she
heard
may
say
sorrowfully,--
it's
too
bad
for
there
is
no
time
to
make
other
things
and
i
don't
want
to
fill
up
with
odds
and
ends
the
table
was
just
complete
then
now
it's
spoilt
i
dare
say
she'd
put
them
back
if
you
asked
her
suggested
some
one
how
could
i
after
all
the
fuss
began
may
but
she
did
not
finish
for
amy's
voice
came
across
the
hall
saying
pleasantly,--
you
may
have
them
and
welcome
without
asking
if
you
want
them
i
was
just
thinking
i'd
offer
to
put
them
back
for
they
belong
to
your
table
rather
than
mine
here
they
are
please
take
them
and
forgive
me
if
i
was
hasty
in
carrying
them
away
last
night
as
she
spoke
amy
returned
her
contribution
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
and
hurried
away
again
feeling
that
it
was
easier
to
do
a
friendly
thing
than
it
was
to
stay
and
be
thanked
for
it
now
i
call
that
lovely
of
her
don't
you
cried
one
girl
may's
answer
was
inaudible
but
another
young
lady
whose
temper
was
evidently
a
little
soured
by
making
lemonade
added
with
a
disagreeable
laugh
very
lovely
for
she
knew
she
wouldn't
sell
them
at
her
own
table
now
that
was
hard
when
we
make
little
sacrifices
we
like
to
have
them
appreciated
at
least
and
for
a
minute
amy
was
sorry
she
had
done
it
feeling
that
virtue
was
not
always
its
own
reward
but
it
is,--as
she
presently
discovered
for
her
spirits
began
to
rise
and
her
table
to
blossom
under
her
skilful
hands
the
girls
were
very
kind
and
that
one
little
act
seemed
to
have
cleared
the
atmosphere
amazingly
it
was
a
very
long
day
and
a
hard
one
to
amy
as
she
sat
behind
her
table
often
quite
alone
for
the
little
girls
deserted
very
soon
few
cared
to
buy
flowers
in
summer
and
her
bouquets
began
to
droop
long
before
night
the
art-table
_was_
the
most
attractive
in
the
room
there
was
a
crowd
about
it
all
day
long
and
the
tenders
were
constantly
flying
to
and
fro
with
important
faces
and
rattling
money-boxes
amy
often
looked
wistfully
across
longing
to
be
there
where
she
felt
at
home
and
happy
instead
of
in
a
corner
with
nothing
to
do
it
might
seem
no
hardship
to
some
of
us
but
to
a
pretty
blithe
young
girl
it
was
not
only
tedious
but
very
trying
and
the
thought
of
being
found
there
in
the
evening
by
her
family
and
laurie
and
his
friends
made
it
a
real
martyrdom
she
did
not
go
home
till
night
and
then
she
looked
so
pale
and
quiet
that
they
knew
the
day
had
been
a
hard
one
though
she
made
no
complaint
and
did
not
even
tell
what
she
had
done
her
mother
gave
her
an
extra
cordial
cup
of
tea
beth
helped
her
dress
and
made
a
charming
little
wreath
for
her
hair
while
jo
astonished
her
family
by
getting
herself
up
with
unusual
care
and
hinting
darkly
that
the
tables
were
about
to
be
turned
don't
do
anything
rude
pray
jo
i
won't
have
any
fuss
made
so
let
it
all
pass
and
behave
yourself
begged
amy
as
she
departed
early
hoping
to
find
a
reinforcement
of
flowers
to
refresh
her
poor
little
table
i
merely
intend
to
make
myself
entrancingly
agreeable
to
every
one
i
know
and
to
keep
them
in
your
corner
as
long
as
possible
teddy
and
his
boys
will
lend
a
hand
and
we'll
have
a
good
time
yet
returned
jo
leaning
over
the
gate
to
watch
for
laurie
presently
the
familiar
tramp
was
heard
in
the
dusk
and
she
ran
out
to
meet
him
is
that
my
boy
as
sure
as
this
is
my
girl
and
laurie
tucked
her
hand
under
his
arm
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
every
wish
was
gratified
o
teddy
such
doings
and
jo
told
amy's
wrongs
with
sisterly
zeal
a
flock
of
our
fellows
are
going
to
drive
over
by
and
by
and
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
don't
make
them
buy
every
flower
she's
got
and
camp
down
before
her
table
afterward
said
laurie
espousing
her
cause
with
warmth
the
flowers
are
not
at
all
nice
amy
says
and
the
fresh
ones
may
not
arrive
in
time
i
don't
wish
to
be
unjust
or
suspicious
but
i
shouldn't
wonder
if
they
never
came
at
all
when
people
do
one
mean
thing
they
are
very
likely
to
do
another
observed
jo
in
a
disgusted
tone
didn't
hayes
give
you
the
best
out
of
our
gardens
i
told
him
to
i
didn't
know
that
he
forgot
i
suppose
and
as
your
grandpa
was
poorly
i
didn't
like
to
worry
him
by
asking
though
i
did
want
some
now
jo
how
could
you
think
there
was
any
need
of
asking
they
are
just
as
much
yours
as
mine
don't
we
always
go
halves
in
everything
began
laurie
in
the
tone
that
always
made
jo
turn
thorny
gracious
i
hope
not
half
of
some
of
your
things
wouldn't
suit
me
at
all
but
we
mustn't
stand
philandering
here
i've
got
to
help
amy
so
you
go
and
make
yourself
splendid
and
if
you'll
be
so
very
kind
as
to
let
hayes
take
a
few
nice
flowers
up
to
the
hall
i'll
bless
you
forever
couldn't
you
do
it
now
asked
laurie
so
suggestively
that
jo
shut
the
gate
in
his
face
with
inhospitable
haste
and
called
through
the
bars
go
away
teddy
i'm
busy
thanks
to
the
conspirators
the
tables
_were_
turned
that
night
for
hayes
sent
up
a
wilderness
of
flowers
with
a
lovely
basket
arranged
in
his
best
manner
for
a
centre-piece
then
the
march
family
turned
out
_en
masse_
and
jo
exerted
herself
to
some
purpose
for
people
not
only
came
but
stayed
laughing
at
her
nonsense
admiring
amy's
taste
and
apparently
enjoying
themselves
very
much
laurie
and
his
friends
gallantly
threw
themselves
into
the
breach
bought
up
the
bouquets
encamped
before
the
table
and
made
that
corner
the
liveliest
spot
in
the
room
amy
was
in
her
element
now
and
out
of
gratitude
if
nothing
more
was
as
sprightly
and
gracious
as
possible,--coming
to
the
conclusion
about
that
time
that
virtue
_was_
its
own
reward
after
all
illustration
bought
up
the
bouquets
jo
behaved
herself
with
exemplary
propriety
and
when
amy
was
happily
surrounded
by
her
guard
of
honor
jo
circulated
about
the
hall
picking
up
various
bits
of
gossip
which
enlightened
her
upon
the
subject
of
the
chester
change
of
base
she
reproached
herself
for
her
share
of
the
ill-feeling
and
resolved
to
exonerate
amy
as
soon
as
possible
she
also
discovered
what
amy
had
done
about
the
things
in
the
morning
and
considered
her
a
model
of
magnanimity
as
she
passed
the
art-table
she
glanced
over
it
for
her
sister's
things
but
saw
no
signs
of
them
tucked
away
out
of
sight
i
dare
say
thought
jo
who
could
forgive
her
own
wrongs
but
hotly
resented
any
insult
offered
to
her
family
good
evening
miss
jo
how
does
amy
get
on
asked
may
with
a
conciliatory
air
for
she
wanted
to
show
that
she
also
could
be
generous
she
has
sold
everything
she
had
that
was
worth
selling
and
now
she
is
enjoying
herself
the
flower-table
is
always
attractive
you
know
'especially
to
gentlemen.'
jo
_couldn't_
resist
giving
that
little
slap
but
may
took
it
so
meekly
she
regretted
it
a
minute
after
and
fell
to
praising
the
great
vases
which
still
remained
unsold
is
amy's
illumination
anywhere
about
i
took
a
fancy
to
buy
that
for
father
said
jo
very
anxious
to
learn
the
fate
of
her
sister's
work
everything
of
amy's
sold
long
ago
i
took
care
that
the
right
people
saw
them
and
they
made
a
nice
little
sum
of
money
for
us
returned
may
who
had
overcome
sundry
small
temptations
as
well
as
amy
that
day
much
gratified
jo
rushed
back
to
tell
the
good
news
and
amy
looked
both
touched
and
surprised
by
the
report
of
may's
words
and
manner
now
gentlemen
i
want
you
to
go
and
do
your
duty
by
the
other
tables
as
generously
as
you
have
by
mine--especially
the
art-table
she
said
ordering
out
teddy's
own
as
the
girls
called
the
college
friends
'charge
chester
charge!'
is
the
motto
for
that
table
but
do
your
duty
like
men
and
you'll
get
your
money's
worth
of
_art_
in
every
sense
of
the
word
said
the
irrepressible
jo
as
the
devoted
phalanx
prepared
to
take
the
field
to
hear
is
to
obey
but
march
is
fairer
far
than
may
said
little
parker
making
a
frantic
effort
to
be
both
witty
and
tender
and
getting
promptly
quenched
by
laurie
who
said
very
well
my
son
for
a
small
boy
and
walked
him
off
with
a
paternal
pat
on
the
head
buy
the
vases
whispered
amy
to
laurie
as
a
final
heaping
of
coals
of
fire
on
her
enemy's
head
to
may's
great
delight
mr
laurence
not
only
bought
the
vases
but
pervaded
the
hall
with
one
under
each
arm
the
other
gentlemen
speculated
with
equal
rashness
in
all
sorts
of
frail
trifles
and
wandered
helplessly
about
afterward
burdened
with
wax
flowers
painted
fans
filigree
portfolios
and
other
useful
and
appropriate
purchases
aunt
carrol
was
there
heard
the
story
looked
pleased
and
said
something
to
mrs
march
in
a
corner
which
made
the
latter
lady
beam
with
satisfaction
and
watch
amy
with
a
face
full
of
mingled
pride
and
anxiety
though
she
did
not
betray
the
cause
of
her
pleasure
till
several
days
later
the
fair
was
pronounced
a
success
and
when
may
bade
amy
good
night
she
did
not
gush
as
usual
but
gave
her
an
affectionate
kiss
and
a
look
which
said
forgive
and
forget
that
satisfied
amy
and
when
she
got
home
she
found
the
vases
paraded
on
the
parlor
chimney-piece
with
a
great
bouquet
in
each
the
reward
of
merit
for
a
magnanimous
march
as
laurie
announced
with
a
flourish
you've
a
deal
more
principle
and
generosity
and
nobleness
of
character
than
i
ever
gave
you
credit
for
amy
you've
behaved
sweetly
and
i
respect
you
with
all
my
heart
said
jo
warmly
as
they
brushed
their
hair
together
late
that
night
yes
we
all
do
and
love
her
for
being
so
ready
to
forgive
it
must
have
been
dreadfully
hard
after
working
so
long
and
setting
your
heart
on
selling
your
own
pretty
things
i
don't
believe
i
could
have
done
it
as
kindly
as
you
did
added
beth
from
her
pillow
why
girls
you
needn't
praise
me
so
i
only
did
as
i'd
be
done
by
you
laugh
at
me
when
i
say
i
want
to
be
a
lady
but
i
mean
a
true
gentlewoman
in
mind
and
manners
and
i
try
to
do
it
as
far
as
i
know
how
i
can't
explain
exactly
but
i
want
to
be
above
the
little
meannesses
and
follies
and
faults
that
spoil
so
many
women
i'm
far
from
it
now
but
i
do
my
best
and
hope
in
time
to
be
what
mother
is
amy
spoke
earnestly
and
jo
said
with
a
cordial
hug,--
i
understand
now
what
you
mean
and
i'll
never
laugh
at
you
again
you
are
getting
on
faster
than
you
think
and
i'll
take
lessons
of
you
in
true
politeness
for
you've
learned
the
secret
i
believe
try
away
deary
you'll
get
your
reward
some
day
and
no
one
will
be
more
delighted
than
i
shall
a
week
later
amy
did
get
her
reward
and
poor
jo
found
it
hard
to
be
delighted
a
letter
came
from
aunt
carrol
and
mrs
march's
face
was
illuminated
to
such
a
degree
when
she
read
it
that
jo
and
beth
who
were
with
her
demanded
what
the
glad
tidings
were
aunt
carrol
is
going
abroad
next
month
and
wants--
me
to
go
with
her
burst
in
jo
flying
out
of
her
chair
in
an
uncontrollable
rapture
no
dear
not
you
it's
amy
o
mother
she's
too
young
it's
my
turn
first
i've
wanted
it
so
long--it
would
do
me
so
much
good
and
be
so
altogether
splendid--i
_must_
go
i'm
afraid
it's
impossible
jo
aunt
says
amy
decidedly
and
it
is
not
for
us
to
dictate
when
she
offers
such
a
favor
it's
always
so
amy
has
all
the
fun
and
i
have
all
the
work
it
isn't
fair
oh
it
isn't
fair
cried
jo
passionately
i'm
afraid
it
is
partly
your
own
fault
dear
when
aunt
spoke
to
me
the
other
day
she
regretted
your
blunt
manners
and
too
independent
spirit
and
here
she
writes
as
if
quoting
something
you
had
said,--'i
planned
at
first
to
ask
jo
but
as
favors
burden
her
and
she
hates
french
i
think
i
won't
venture
to
invite
her
amy
is
more
docile
will
make
a
good
companion
for
flo
and
receive
gratefully
any
help
the
trip
may
give
her.'
oh
my
tongue
my
abominable
tongue
why
can't
i
learn
to
keep
it
quiet
groaned
jo
remembering
words
which
had
been
her
undoing
when
she
had
heard
the
explanation
of
the
quoted
phrases
mrs
march
said
sorrowfully,--
i
wish
you
could
have
gone
but
there
is
no
hope
of
it
this
time
so
try
to
bear
it
cheerfully
and
don't
sadden
amy's
pleasure
by
reproaches
or
regrets
i'll
try
said
jo
winking
hard
as
she
knelt
down
to
pick
up
the
basket
she
had
joyfully
upset
i'll
take
a
leaf
out
of
her
book
and
try
not
only
to
seem
glad
but
to
be
so
and
not
grudge
her
one
minute
of
happiness
but
it
won't
be
easy
for
it
is
a
dreadful
disappointment
and
poor
jo
bedewed
the
little
fat
pincushion
she
held
with
several
very
bitter
tears
jo
dear
i'm
very
selfish
but
i
couldn't
spare
you
and
i'm
glad
you
are
not
going
quite
yet
whispered
beth
embracing
her
basket
and
all
with
such
a
clinging
touch
and
loving
face
that
jo
felt
comforted
in
spite
of
the
sharp
regret
that
made
her
want
to
box
her
own
ears
and
humbly
beg
aunt
carrol
to
burden
her
with
this
favor
and
see
how
gratefully
she
would
bear
it
by
the
time
amy
came
in
jo
was
able
to
take
her
part
in
the
family
jubilation
not
quite
as
heartily
as
usual
perhaps
but
without
repinings
at
amy's
good
fortune
the
young
lady
herself
received
the
news
as
tidings
of
great
joy
went
about
in
a
solemn
sort
of
rapture
and
began
to
sort
her
colors
and
pack
her
pencils
that
evening
leaving
such
trifles
as
clothes
money
and
passports
to
those
less
absorbed
in
visions
of
art
than
herself
it
isn't
a
mere
pleasure
trip
to
me
girls
she
said
impressively
as
she
scraped
her
best
palette
it
will
decide
my
career
for
if
i
have
any
genius
i
shall
find
it
out
in
rome
and
will
do
something
to
prove
it
suppose
you
haven't
said
jo
sewing
away
with
red
eyes
at
the
new
collars
which
were
to
be
handed
over
to
amy
then
i
shall
come
home
and
teach
drawing
for
my
living
replied
the
aspirant
for
fame
with
philosophic
composure
but
she
made
a
wry
face
at
the
prospect
and
scratched
away
at
her
palette
as
if
bent
on
vigorous
measures
before
she
gave
up
her
hopes
no
you
won't
you
hate
hard
work
and
you'll
marry
some
rich
man
and
come
home
to
sit
in
the
lap
of
luxury
all
your
days
said
jo
your
predictions
sometimes
come
to
pass
but
i
don't
believe
that
one
will
i'm
sure
i
wish
it
would
for
if
i
can't
be
an
artist
myself
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
help
those
who
are
said
amy
smiling
as
if
the
part
of
lady
bountiful
would
suit
her
better
than
that
of
a
poor
drawing-teacher
hum
said
jo
with
a
sigh
if
you
wish
it
you'll
have
it
for
your
wishes
are
always
granted--mine
never
would
you
like
to
go
asked
amy
thoughtfully
patting
her
nose
with
her
knife
rather
well
in
a
year
or
two
i'll
send
for
you
and
we'll
dig
in
the
forum
for
relics
and
carry
out
all
the
plans
we've
made
so
many
times
thank
you
i'll
remind
you
of
your
promise
when
that
joyful
day
comes
if
it
ever
does
returned
jo
accepting
the
vague
but
magnificent
offer
as
gratefully
as
she
could
there
was
not
much
time
for
preparation
and
the
house
was
in
a
ferment
till
amy
was
off
jo
bore
up
very
well
till
the
last
flutter
of
blue
ribbon
vanished
when
she
retired
to
her
refuge
the
garret
and
cried
till
she
couldn't
cry
any
more
amy
likewise
bore
up
stoutly
till
the
steamer
sailed
then
just
as
the
gangway
was
about
to
be
withdrawn
it
suddenly
came
over
her
that
a
whole
ocean
was
soon
to
roll
between
her
and
those
who
loved
her
best
and
she
clung
to
laurie
the
last
lingerer
saying
with
a
sob,--
oh
take
care
of
them
for
me
and
if
anything
should
happen--
i
will
dear
i
will
and
if
anything
happens
i'll
come
and
comfort
you
whispered
laurie
little
dreaming
that
he
would
be
called
upon
to
keep
his
word
so
amy
sailed
away
to
find
the
old
world
which
is
always
new
and
beautiful
to
young
eyes
while
her
father
and
friend
watched
her
from
the
shore
fervently
hoping
that
none
but
gentle
fortunes
would
befall
the
happy-hearted
girl
who
waved
her
hand
to
them
till
they
could
see
nothing
but
the
summer
sunshine
dazzling

our
foreign
correspondent

dearest
people,--
here
i
really
sit
at
a
front
window
of
the
bath
hotel
piccadilly
it's
not
a
fashionable
place
but
uncle
stopped
here
years
ago
and
won't
go
anywhere
else
however
we
don't
mean
to
stay
long
so
it's
no
great
matter
oh
i
can't
begin
to
tell
you
how
i
enjoy
it
all
i
never
can
so
i'll
only
give
you
bits
out
of
my
note-book
for
i've
done
nothing
but
sketch
and
scribble
since
i
started
i
sent
a
line
from
halifax
when
i
felt
pretty
miserable
but
after
that
i
got
on
delightfully
seldom
ill
on
deck
all
day
with
plenty
of
pleasant
people
to
amuse
me
every
one
was
very
kind
to
me
especially
the
officers
don't
laugh
jo
gentlemen
really
are
very
necessary
aboard
ship
to
hold
on
to
or
to
wait
upon
one
and
as
they
have
nothing
to
do
it's
a
mercy
to
make
them
useful
otherwise
they
would
smoke
themselves
to

aunt
and
flo
were
poorly
all
the
way
and
liked
to
be
let
alone
so
when
i
had
done
what
i
could
for
them
i
went
and
enjoyed
myself
such
walks
on
deck
such
sunsets
such
splendid
air
and
waves
it
was
almost
as
exciting
as
riding
a
fast
horse
when
we
went
rushing
on
so
grandly
i
wish
beth
could
have
come
it
would
have
done
her
so
much
good
as
for
jo
she
would
have
gone
up
and
sat
on
the
main-top
jib
or
whatever
the
high
thing
is
called
made
friends
with
the
engineers
and
tooted
on
the
captain's
speaking-trumpet
she'd
have
been
in
such
a
state
of
rapture
it
was
all
heavenly
but
i
was
glad
to
see
the
irish
coast
and
found
it
very
lovely
so
green
and
sunny
with
brown
cabins
here
and
there
ruins
on
some
of
the
hills
and
gentlemen's
country-seats
in
the
valleys
with
deer
feeding
in
the
parks
it
was
early
in
the
morning
but
i
didn't
regret
getting
up
to
see
it
for
the
bay
was
full
of
little
boats
the
shore
_so_
picturesque
and
a
rosy
sky
overhead
i
never
shall
forget
it
at
queenstown
one
of
my
new
acquaintances
left
us,--mr
lennox,--and
when
i
said
something
about
the
lakes
of
killarney
he
sighed
and
sung
with
a
look
at
me,--
'oh
have
you
e'er
heard
of
kate
kearney
she
lives
on
the
banks
of
killarney
from
the
glance
of
her
eye
shun
danger
and
fly
for
fatal's
the
glance
of
kate
kearney.'
wasn't
that
nonsensical
we
only
stopped
at
liverpool
a
few
hours
it's
a
dirty
noisy
place
and
i
was
glad
to
leave
it
uncle
rushed
out
and
bought
a
pair
of
dog-skin
gloves
some
ugly
thick
shoes
and
an
umbrella
and
got
shaved
_à
la_
mutton-chop
the
first
thing
then
he
flattered
himself
that
he
looked
like
a
true
briton
but
the
first
time
he
had
the
mud
cleaned
off
his
shoes
the
little
bootblack
knew
that
an
american
stood
in
them
and
said
with
a
grin
'there
yer
har
sir
i've
give
'em
the
latest
yankee
shine.'
it
amused
uncle
immensely
oh
i
_must_
tell
you
what
that
absurd
lennox
did
he
got
his
friend
ward
who
came
on
with
us
to
order
a
bouquet
for
me
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
in
my
room
was
a
lovely
one
with
'robert
lennox's
compliments,'
on
the
card
wasn't
that
fun
girls
i
like
travelling
i
never
_shall_
get
to
london
if
i
don't
hurry
the
trip
was
like
riding
through
a
long
picture-gallery
full
of
lovely
landscapes
the
farmhouses
were
my
delight
with
thatched
roofs
ivy
up
to
the
eaves
latticed
windows
and
stout
women
with
rosy
children
at
the
doors
the
very
cattle
looked
more
tranquil
than
ours
as
they
stood
knee-deep
in
clover
and
the
hens
had
a
contented
cluck
as
if
they
never
got
nervous
like
yankee
biddies
such
perfect
color
i
never
saw,--the
grass
so
green
sky
so
blue
grain
so
yellow
woods
so
dark,--i
was
in
a
rapture
all
the
way
so
was
flo
and
we
kept
bouncing
from
one
side
to
the
other
trying
to
see
everything
while
we
were
whisking
along
at
the
rate
of
sixty
miles
an
hour
aunt
was
tired
and
went
to
sleep
but
uncle
read
his
guide-book
and
wouldn't
be
astonished
at
anything
this
is
the
way
we
went
on
amy
flying
up,--'oh
that
must
be
kenilworth
that
gray
place
among
the
trees!'
flo
darting
to
my
window,--'how
sweet
we
must
go
there
some
time
won't
we
papa?'
uncle
calmly
admiring
his
boots,--'no
my
dear
not
unless
you
want
beer
that's
a
brewery.'
a
pause,--then
flo
cried
out
'bless
me
there's
a
gallows
and
a
man
going
up.'
'where
where?'
shrieks
amy
staring
out
at
two
tall
posts
with
a
cross-beam
and
some
dangling
chains
'a
colliery,'
remarks
uncle
with
a
twinkle
of
the
eye
'here's
a
lovely
flock
of
lambs
all
lying
down,'
says
amy
'see
papa
aren't
they
pretty!'
added
flo
sentimentally
'geese
young
ladies,'
returns
uncle
in
a
tone
that
keeps
us
quiet
till
flo
settles
down
to
enjoy
'the
flirtations
of
capt
cavendish,'
and
i
have
the
scenery
all
to
myself
of
course
it
rained
when
we
got
to
london
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
fog
and
umbrellas
we
rested
unpacked
and
shopped
a
little
between
the
showers
aunt
mary
got
me
some
new
things
for
i
came
off
in
such
a
hurry
i
wasn't
half
ready
a
white
hat
and
blue
feather
a
muslin
dress
to
match
and
the
loveliest
mantle
you
ever
saw
shopping
in
regent
street
is
perfectly
splendid
things
seem
so
cheap--nice
ribbons
only
sixpence
a
yard
i
laid
in
a
stock
but
shall
get
my
gloves
in
paris
doesn't
that
sound
sort
of
elegant
and
rich
flo
and
i
for
the
fun
of
it
ordered
a
hansom
cab
while
aunt
and
uncle
were
out
and
went
for
a
drive
though
we
learned
afterward
that
it
wasn't
the
thing
for
young
ladies
to
ride
in
them
alone
it
was
so
droll
for
when
we
were
shut
in
by
the
wooden
apron
the
man
drove
so
fast
that
flo
was
frightened
and
told
me
to
stop
him
but
he
was
up
outside
behind
somewhere
and
i
couldn't
get
at
him
he
didn't
hear
me
call
nor
see
me
flap
my
parasol
in
front
and
there
we
were
quite
helpless
rattling
away
and
whirling
around
corners
at
a
break-neck
pace
at
last
in
my
despair
i
saw
a
little
door
in
the
roof
and
on
poking
it
open
a
red
eye
appeared
and
a
beery
voice
said,--
'now
then
mum?'
i
gave
my
order
as
soberly
as
i
could
and
slamming
down
the
door
with
an
'aye
aye
mum,'
the
man
made
his
horse
walk
as
if
going
to
a
funeral
i
poked
again
and
said
'a
little
faster;'
then
off
he
went
helter-skelter
as
before
and
we
resigned
ourselves
to
our
fate
to-day
was
fair
and
we
went
to
hyde
park
close
by
for
we
are
more
aristocratic
than
we
look
the
duke
of
devonshire
lives
near
i
often
see
his
footmen
lounging
at
the
back
gate
and
the
duke
of
wellington's
house
is
not
far
off
such
sights
as
i
saw
my
dear
it
was
as
good
as
punch
for
there
were
fat
dowagers
rolling
about
in
their
red
and
yellow
coaches
with
gorgeous
jeameses
in
silk
stockings
and
velvet
coats
up
behind
and
powdered
coachmen
in
front
smart
maids
with
the
rosiest
children
i
ever
saw
handsome
girls
looking
half
asleep
dandies
in
queer
english
hats
and
lavender
kids
lounging
about
and
tall
soldiers
in
short
red
jackets
and
muffin
caps
stuck
on
one
side
looking
so
funny
i
longed
to
sketch
them
rotten
row
means
'_route
de
roi_,'
or
the
king's
way
but
now
it's
more
like
a
riding-school
than
anything
else
the
horses
are
splendid
and
the
men
especially
the
grooms
ride
well
but
the
women
are
stiff
and
bounce
which
isn't
according
to
our
rules
i
longed
to
show
them
a
tearing
american
gallop
for
they
trotted
solemnly
up
and
down
in
their
scant
habits
and
high
hats
looking
like
the
women
in
a
toy
noah's
ark
every
one
rides,--old
men
stout
ladies
little
children,--and
the
young
folks
do
a
deal
of
flirting
here
i
saw
a
pair
exchange
rosebuds
for
it's
the
thing
to
wear
one
in
the
button-hole
and
i
thought
it
rather
a
nice
little
idea
in
the
p.m
to
westminster
abbey
but
don't
expect
me
to
describe
it
that's
impossible--so
i'll
only
say
it
was
sublime
this
evening
we
are
going
to
see
fechter
which
will
be
an
appropriate
end
to
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
midnight
it's
very
late
but
i
can't
let
my
letter
go
in
the
morning
without
telling
you
what
happened
last
evening
who
do
you
think
came
in
as
we
were
at
tea
laurie's
english
friends
fred
and
frank
vaughn
i
was
_so_
surprised
for
i
shouldn't
have
known
them
but
for
the
cards
both
are
tall
fellows
with
whiskers
fred
handsome
in
the
english
style
and
frank
much
better
for
he
only
limps
slightly
and
uses
no
crutches
they
had
heard
from
laurie
where
we
were
to
be
and
came
to
ask
us
to
their
house
but
uncle
won't
go
so
we
shall
return
the
call
and
see
them
as
we
can
they
went
to
the
theatre
with
us
and
we
did
have
_such_
a
good
time
for
frank
devoted
himself
to
flo
and
fred
and
i
talked
over
past
present
and
future
fun
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
all
our
days
tell
beth
frank
asked
for
her
and
was
sorry
to
hear
of
her
ill
health
fred
laughed
when
i
spoke
of
jo
and
sent
his
'respectful
compliments
to
the
big
hat.'
neither
of
them
had
forgotten
camp
laurence
or
the
fun
we
had
there
what
ages
ago
it
seems
doesn't
it
aunt
is
tapping
on
the
wall
for
the
third
time
so
i
_must_
stop
i
really
feel
like
a
dissipated
london
fine
lady
writing
here
so
late
with
my
room
full
of
pretty
things
and
my
head
a
jumble
of
parks
theatres
new
gowns
and
gallant
creatures
who
say
'ah!'
and
twirl
their
blond
mustaches
with
the
true
english
lordliness
i
long
to
see
you
all
and
in
spite
of
my
nonsense
am
as
ever
your
loving
amy
dear
girls,--
paris
in
my
last
i
told
you
about
our
london
visit,--how
kind
the
vaughns
were
and
what
pleasant
parties
they
made
for
us
i
enjoyed
the
trips
to
hampton
court
and
the
kensington
museum
more
than
anything
else,--for
at
hampton
i
saw
raphael's
cartoons
and
at
the
museum
rooms
full
of
pictures
by
turner
lawrence
reynolds
hogarth
and
the
other
great
creatures
the
day
in
richmond
park
was
charming
for
we
had
a
regular
english
picnic
and
i
had
more
splendid
oaks
and
groups
of
deer
than
i
could
copy
also
heard
a
nightingale
and
saw
larks
go
up
we
'did'
london
to
our
hearts'
content
thanks
to
fred
and
frank
and
were
sorry
to
go
away
for
though
english
people
are
slow
to
take
you
in
when
they
once
make
up
their
minds
to
do
it
they
cannot
be
outdone
in
hospitality
_i_
think
the
vaughns
hope
to
meet
us
in
rome
next
winter
and
i
shall
be
dreadfully
disappointed
if
they
don't
for
grace
and
i
are
great
friends
and
the
boys
very
nice
fellows,--especially
fred
well
we
were
hardly
settled
here
when
he
turned
up
again
saying
he
had
come
for
a
holiday
and
was
going
to
switzerland
aunt
looked
sober
at
first
but
he
was
so
cool
about
it
she
couldn't
say
a
word
and
now
we
get
on
nicely
and
are
very
glad
he
came
for
he
speaks
french
like
a
native
and
i
don't
know
what
we
should
do
without
him
uncle
doesn't
know
ten
words
and
insists
on
talking
english
very
loud
as
if
that
would
make
people
understand
him
aunt's
pronunciation
is
old-fashioned
and
flo
and
i
though
we
flattered
ourselves
that
we
knew
a
good
deal
find
we
don't
and
are
very
grateful
to
have
fred
do
the
'_parley
vooing_,'
as
uncle
calls
it
such
delightful
times
as
we
are
having
sight-seeing
from
morning
till
night
stopping
for
nice
lunches
in
the
gay
_cafés_
and
meeting
with
all
sorts
of
droll
adventures
rainy
days
i
spend
in
the
louvre
revelling
in
pictures
jo
would
turn
up
her
naughty
nose
at
some
of
the
finest
because
she
has
no
soul
for
art
but
_i_
have
and
i'm
cultivating
eye
and
taste
as
fast
as
i
can
she
would
like
the
relics
of
great
people
better
for
i've
seen
her
napoleon's
cocked
hat
and
gray
coat
his
baby's
cradle
and
his
old
toothbrush
also
marie
antoinette's
little
shoe
the
ring
of
saint
denis
charlemagne's
sword
and
many
other
interesting
things
i'll
talk
for
hours
about
them
when
i
come
but
haven't
time
to
write
the
palais
royale
is
a
heavenly
place,--so
full
of
_bijouterie_
and
lovely
things
that
i'm
nearly
distracted
because
i
can't
buy
them
fred
wanted
to
get
me
some
but
of
course
i
didn't
allow
it
then
the
bois
and
the
champs
elysées
are
_très
magnifique_
i've
seen
the
imperial
family
several
times,--the
emperor
an
ugly
hard-looking
man
the
empress
pale
and
pretty
but
dressed
in
bad
taste
_i_
thought,--purple
dress
green
hat
and
yellow
gloves
little
nap
is
a
handsome
boy
who
sits
chatting
to
his
tutor
and
kisses
his
hand
to
the
people
as
he
passes
in
his
four-horse
barouche
with
postilions
in
red
satin
jackets
and
a
mounted
guard
before
and
behind
illustration
i've
seen
the
imperial
family
several
times
we
often
walk
in
the
tuileries
gardens
for
they
are
lovely
though
the
antique
luxembourg
gardens
suit
me
better
père
la
chaise
is
very
curious
for
many
of
the
tombs
are
like
small
rooms
and
looking
in
one
sees
a
table
with
images
or
pictures
of
the
dead
and
chairs
for
the
mourners
to
sit
in
when
they
come
to
lament
that
is
so
frenchy
our
rooms
are
on
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
sitting
in
the
balcony
we
look
up
and
down
the
long
brilliant
street
it
is
so
pleasant
that
we
spend
our
evenings
talking
there
when
too
tired
with
our
day's
work
to
go
out
fred
is
very
entertaining
and
is
altogether
the
most
agreeable
young
man
i
ever
knew,--except
laurie
whose
manners
are
more
charming
i
wish
fred
was
dark
for
i
don't
fancy
light
men
however
the
vaughns
are
very
rich
and
come
of
an
excellent
family
so
i
won't
find
fault
with
their
yellow
hair
as
my
own
is
yellower
next
week
we
are
off
to
germany
and
switzerland
and
as
we
shall
travel
fast
i
shall
only
be
able
to
give
you
hasty
letters
i
keep
my
diary
and
try
to
'remember
correctly
and
describe
clearly
all
that
i
see
and
admire,'
as
father
advised
it
is
good
practice
for
me
and
with
my
sketch-book
will
give
you
a
better
idea
of
my
tour
than
these
scribbles
adieu
i
embrace
you
tenderly
votre
amie
my
dear
mamma,--
heidelberg
having
a
quiet
hour
before
we
leave
for
berne
i'll
try
to
tell
you
what
has
happened
for
some
of
it
is
very
important
as
you
will
see
the
sail
up
the
rhine
was
perfect
and
i
just
sat
and
enjoyed
it
with
all
my
might
get
father's
old
guide-books
and
read
about
it
i
haven't
words
beautiful
enough
to
describe
it
at
coblentz
we
had
a
lovely
time
for
some
students
from
bonn
with
whom
fred
got
acquainted
on
the
boat
gave
us
a
serenade
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
about
one
o'clock
flo
and
i
were
waked
by
the
most
delicious
music
under
our
windows
we
flew
up
and
hid
behind
the
curtains
but
sly
peeps
showed
us
fred
and
the
students
singing
away
down
below
it
was
the
most
romantic
thing
i
ever
saw,--the
river
the
bridge
of
boats
the
great
fortress
opposite
moonlight
everywhere
and
music
fit
to
melt
a
heart
of
stone
when
they
were
done
we
threw
down
some
flowers
and
saw
them
scramble
for
them
kiss
their
hands
to
the
invisible
ladies
and
go
laughing
away,--to
smoke
and
drink
beer
i
suppose
next
morning
fred
showed
me
one
of
the
crumpled
flowers
in
his
vest-pocket
and
looked
very
sentimental
i
laughed
at
him
and
said
i
didn't
throw
it
but
flo
which
seemed
to
disgust
him
for
he
tossed
it
out
of
the
window
and
turned
sensible
again
i'm
afraid
i'm
going
to
have
trouble
with
that
boy
it
begins
to
look
like
it
the
baths
at
nassau
were
very
gay
so
was
baden-baden
where
fred
lost
some
money
and
i
scolded
him
he
needs
some
one
to
look
after
him
when
frank
is
not
with
him
kate
said
once
she
hoped
he'd
marry
soon
and
i
quite
agree
with
her
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
frankfort
was
delightful
i
saw
goethe's
house
schiller's
statue
and
dannecker's
famous
'ariadne.'
it
was
very
lovely
but
i
should
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
i
had
known
the
story
better
i
didn't
like
to
ask
as
every
one
knew
it
or
pretended
they
did
i
wish
jo
would
tell
me
all
about
it
i
ought
to
have
read
more
for
i
find
i
don't
know
anything
and
it
mortifies
me
now
comes
the
serious
part,--for
it
happened
here
and
fred
is
just
gone
he
has
been
so
kind
and
jolly
that
we
all
got
quite
fond
of
him
i
never
thought
of
anything
but
a
travelling
friendship
till
the
serenade
night
since
then
i've
begun
to
feel
that
the
moonlight
walks
balcony
talks
and
daily
adventures
were
something
more
to
him
than
fun
i
haven't
flirted
mother
truly
but
remembered
what
you
said
to
me
and
have
done
my
very
best
i
can't
help
it
if
people
like
me
i
don't
try
to
make
them
and
it
worries
me
if
i
don't
care
for
them
though
jo
says
i
haven't
got
any
heart
now
i
know
mother
will
shake
her
head
and
the
girls
say
'oh
the
mercenary
little
wretch!'
but
i've
made
up
my
mind
and
if
fred
asks
me
i
shall
accept
him
though
i'm
not
madly
in
love
i
like
him
and
we
get
on
comfortably
together
he
is
handsome
young
clever
enough
and
very
rich,--ever
so
much
richer
than
the
laurences
i
don't
think
his
family
would
object
and
i
should
be
very
happy
for
they
are
all
kind
well-bred
generous
people
and
they
like
me
fred
as
the
eldest
twin
will
have
the
estate
i
suppose
and
such
a
splendid
one
as
it
is
a
city
house
in
a
fashionable
street
not
so
showy
as
our
big
houses
but
twice
as
comfortable
and
full
of
solid
luxury
such
as
english
people
believe
in
i
like
it
for
it's
genuine
i've
seen
the
plate
the
family
jewels
the
old
servants
and
pictures
of
the
country
place
with
its
park
great
house
lovely
grounds
and
fine
horses
oh
it
would
be
all
i
should
ask
and
i'd
rather
have
it
than
any
title
such
as
girls
snap
up
so
readily
and
find
nothing
behind
i
may
be
mercenary
but
i
hate
poverty
and
don't
mean
to
bear
it
a
minute
longer
than
i
can
help
one
of
us
_must_
marry
well
meg
didn't
jo
won't
beth
can't
yet
so
i
shall
and
make
everything
cosey
all
round
i
wouldn't
marry
a
man
i
hated
or
despised
you
may
be
sure
of
that
and
though
fred
is
not
my
model
hero
he
does
very
well
and
in
time
i
should
get
fond
enough
of
him
if
he
was
very
fond
of
me
and
let
me
do
just
as
i
liked
so
i've
been
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
the
last
week
for
it
was
impossible
to
help
seeing
that
fred
liked
me
he
said
nothing
but
little
things
showed
it
he
never
goes
with
flo
always
gets
on
my
side
of
the
carriage
table
or
promenade
looks
sentimental
when
we
are
alone
and
frowns
at
any
one
else
who
ventures
to
speak
to
me
yesterday
at
dinner
when
an
austrian
officer
stared
at
us
and
then
said
something
to
his
friend,--a
rakish-looking
baron,--about
'_ein
wonderschönes
blöndchen_,'
fred
looked
as
fierce
as
a
lion
and
cut
his
meat
so
savagely
it
nearly
flew
off
his
plate
he
isn't
one
of
the
cool
stiff
englishmen
but
is
rather
peppery
for
he
has
scotch
blood
in
him
as
one
might
guess
from
his
bonnie
blue
eyes
well
last
evening
we
went
up
to
the
castle
about
sunset,--at
least
all
of
us
but
fred
who
was
to
meet
us
there
after
going
to
the
post
restante
for
letters
we
had
a
charming
time
poking
about
the
ruins
the
vaults
where
the
monster
tun
is
and
the
beautiful
gardens
made
by
the
elector
long
ago
for
his
english
wife
i
liked
the
great
terrace
best
for
the
view
was
divine
so
while
the
rest
went
to
see
the
rooms
inside
i
sat
there
trying
to
sketch
the
gray
stone
lion's
head
on
the
wall
with
scarlet
woodbine
sprays
hanging
round
it
i
felt
as
if
i'd
got
into
a
romance
sitting
there
watching
the
neckar
rolling
through
the
valley
listening
to
the
music
of
the
austrian
band
below
and
waiting
for
my
lover
like
a
real
story-book
girl
i
had
a
feeling
that
something
was
going
to
happen
and
i
was
ready
for
it
i
didn't
feel
blushy
or
quakey
but
quite
cool
and
only
a
little
excited
illustration
trying
to
sketch
the
gray-stone
lion's
head
on
the
wall
by
and
by
i
heard
fred's
voice
and
then
he
came
hurrying
through
the
great
arch
to
find
me
he
looked
so
troubled
that
i
forgot
all
about
myself
and
asked
what
the
matter
was
he
said
he'd
just
got
a
letter
begging
him
to
come
home
for
frank
was
very
ill
so
he
was
going
at
once
in
the
night
train
and
only
had
time
to
say
good-by
i
was
very
sorry
for
him
and
disappointed
for
myself
but
only
for
a
minute
because
he
said
as
he
shook
hands,--and
said
it
in
a
way
that
i
could
not
mistake,--'i
shall
soon
come
back
you
won't
forget
me
amy?'
i
didn't
promise
but
i
looked
at
him
and
he
seemed
satisfied
and
there
was
no
time
for
anything
but
messages
and
good-byes
for
he
was
off
in
an
hour
and
we
all
miss
him
very
much
i
know
he
wanted
to
speak
but
i
think
from
something
he
once
hinted
that
he
had
promised
his
father
not
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
yet
awhile
for
he
is
a
rash
boy
and
the
old
gentleman
dreads
a
foreign
daughter-in-law
we
shall
soon
meet
in
rome
and
then
if
i
don't
change
my
mind
i'll
say
'yes
thank
you,'
when
he
says
'will
you
please?'
of
course
this
is
all
_very
private_
but
i
wished
you
to
know
what
was
going
on
don't
be
anxious
about
me
remember
i
am
your
'prudent
amy,'
and
be
sure
i
will
do
nothing
rashly
send
me
as
much
advice
as
you
like
i'll
use
it
if
i
can
i
wish
i
could
see
you
for
a
good
talk
marmee
love
and
trust
me
ever
your
amy
xxxii
tender
troubles
jo
i'm
anxious
about
beth
why
mother
she
has
seemed
unusually
well
since
the
babies
came
it's
not
her
health
that
troubles
me
now
it's
her
spirits
i'm
sure
there
is
something
on
her
mind
and
i
want
you
to
discover
what
it
is
what
makes
you
think
so
mother
she
sits
alone
a
good
deal
and
doesn't
talk
to
her
father
as
much
as
she
used
i
found
her
crying
over
the
babies
the
other
day
when
she
sings
the
songs
are
always
sad
ones
and
now
and
then
i
see
a
look
in
her
face
that
i
don't
understand
this
isn't
like
beth
and
it
worries
me
have
you
asked
her
about
it
i
have
tried
once
or
twice
but
she
either
evaded
my
questions
or
looked
so
distressed
that
i
stopped
i
never
force
my
children's
confidence
and
i
seldom
have
to
wait
for
it
long
mrs
march
glanced
at
jo
as
she
spoke
but
the
face
opposite
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
any
secret
disquietude
but
beth's
and
after
sewing
thoughtfully
for
a
minute
jo
said,--
i
think
she
is
growing
up
and
so
begins
to
dream
dreams
and
have
hopes
and
fears
and
fidgets
without
knowing
why
or
being
able
to
explain
them
why
mother
beth's
eighteen
but
we
don't
realize
it
and
treat
her
like
a
child
forgetting
she's
a
woman
so
she
is
dear
heart
how
fast
you
do
grow
up
returned
her
mother
with
a
sigh
and
a
smile
can't
be
helped
marmee
so
you
must
resign
yourself
to
all
sorts
of
worries
and
let
your
birds
hop
out
of
the
nest
one
by
one
i
promise
never
to
hop
very
far
if
that
is
any
comfort
to
you
it
is
a
great
comfort
jo
i
always
feel
strong
when
you
are
at
home
now
meg
is
gone
beth
is
too
feeble
and
amy
too
young
to
depend
upon
but
when
the
tug
comes
you
are
always
ready
why
you
know
i
don't
mind
hard
jobs
much
and
there
must
always
be
one
scrub
in
a
family
amy
is
splendid
in
fine
works
and
i'm
not
but
i
feel
in
my
element
when
all
the
carpets
are
to
be
taken
up
or
half
the
family
fall
sick
at
once
amy
is
distinguishing
herself
abroad
but
if
anything
is
amiss
at
home
i'm
your
man
i
leave
beth
to
your
hands
then
for
she
will
open
her
tender
little
heart
to
her
jo
sooner
than
to
any
one
else
be
very
kind
and
don't
let
her
think
any
one
watches
or
talks
about
her
if
she
only
would
get
quite
strong
and
cheerful
again
i
shouldn't
have
a
wish
in
the
world
happy
woman
i've
got
heaps
my
dear
what
are
they
i'll
settle
bethy's
troubles
and
then
i'll
tell
you
mine
they
are
not
very
wearing
so
they'll
keep
and
jo
stitched
away
with
a
wise
nod
which
set
her
mother's
heart
at
rest
about
her
for
the
present
at
least
while
apparently
absorbed
in
her
own
affairs
jo
watched
beth
and
after
many
conflicting
conjectures
finally
settled
upon
one
which
seemed
to
explain
the
change
in
her
a
slight
incident
gave
jo
the
clue
to
the
mystery
she
thought
and
lively
fancy
loving
heart
did
the
rest
she
was
affecting
to
write
busily
one
saturday
afternoon
when
she
and
beth
were
alone
together
yet
as
she
scribbled
she
kept
her
eye
on
her
sister
who
seemed
unusually
quiet
sitting
at
the
window
beth's
work
often
dropped
into
her
lap
and
she
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hand
in
a
dejected
attitude
while
her
eyes
rested
on
the
dull
autumnal
landscape
suddenly
some
one
passed
below
whistling
like
an
operatic
blackbird
and
a
voice
called
out,--
illustration
she
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hands
all
serene
coming
in
to-night
beth
started
leaned
forward
smiled
and
nodded
watched
the
passer-by
till
his
quick
tramp
died
away
then
said
softly
as
if
to
herself,--
how
strong
and
well
and
happy
that
dear
boy
looks
hum
said
jo
still
intent
upon
her
sister's
face
for
the
bright
color
faded
as
quickly
as
it
came
the
smile
vanished
and
presently
a
tear
lay
shining
on
the
window-ledge
beth
whisked
it
off
and
glanced
apprehensively
at
jo
but
she
was
scratching
away
at
a
tremendous
rate
apparently
engrossed
in
olympia's
oath
the
instant
beth
turned
jo
began
her
watch
again
saw
beth's
hand
go
quietly
to
her
eyes
more
than
once
and
in
her
half-averted
face
read
a
tender
sorrow
that
made
her
own
eyes
fill
fearing
to
betray
herself
she
slipped
away
murmuring
something
about
needing
more
paper
mercy
on
me
beth
loves
laurie
she
said
sitting
down
in
her
own
room
pale
with
the
shock
of
the
discovery
which
she
believed
she
had
just
made
i
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
what
_will_
mother
say
i
wonder
if
he--
there
jo
stopped
and
turned
scarlet
with
a
sudden
thought
if
he
shouldn't
love
back
again
how
dreadful
it
would
be
he
must
i'll
make
him
and
she
shook
her
head
threateningly
at
the
picture
of
the
mischievous-looking
boy
laughing
at
her
from
the
wall
oh
dear
we
_are_
growing
up
with
a
vengeance
here's
meg
married
and
a
mamma
amy
flourishing
away
at
paris
and
beth
in
love
i'm
the
only
one
that
has
sense
enough
to
keep
out
of
mischief
jo
thought
intently
for
a
minute
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
picture
then
she
smoothed
out
her
wrinkled
forehead
and
said
with
a
decided
nod
at
the
face
opposite
no
thank
you
sir
you're
very
charming
but
you've
no
more
stability
than
a
weathercock
so
you
needn't
write
touching
notes
and
smile
in
that
insinuating
way
for
it
won't
do
a
bit
of
good
and
i
won't
have
it
then
she
sighed
and
fell
into
a
reverie
from
which
she
did
not
wake
till
the
early
twilight
sent
her
down
to
take
new
observations
which
only
confirmed
her
suspicion
though
laurie
flirted
with
amy
and
joked
with
jo
his
manner
to
beth
had
always
been
peculiarly
kind
and
gentle
but
so
was
everybody's
therefore
no
one
thought
of
imagining
that
he
cared
more
for
her
than
for
the
others
indeed
a
general
impression
had
prevailed
in
the
family
of
late
that
our
boy
was
getting
fonder
than
ever
of
jo
who
however
wouldn't
hear
a
word
upon
the
subject
and
scolded
violently
if
any
one
dared
to
suggest
it
if
they
had
known
the
various
tender
passages
of
the
past
year
or
rather
attempts
at
tender
passages
which
had
been
nipped
in
the
bud
they
would
have
had
the
immense
satisfaction
of
saying
i
told
you
so
but
jo
hated
philandering
and
wouldn't
allow
it
always
having
a
joke
or
a
smile
ready
at
the
least
sign
of
impending
danger
when
laurie
first
went
to
college
he
fell
in
love
about
once
a
month
but
these
small
flames
were
as
brief
as
ardent
did
no
damage
and
much
amused
jo
who
took
great
interest
in
the
alternations
of
hope
despair
and
resignation
which
were
confided
to
her
in
their
weekly
conferences
but
there
came
a
time
when
laurie
ceased
to
worship
at
many
shrines
hinted
darkly
at
one
all-absorbing
passion
and
indulged
occasionally
in
byronic
fits
of
gloom
then
he
avoided
the
tender
subject
altogether
wrote
philosophical
notes
to
jo
turned
studious
and
gave
out
that
he
was
going
to
dig
intending
to
graduate
in
a
blaze
of
glory
this
suited
the
young
lady
better
than
twilight
confidences
tender
pressures
of
the
hand
and
eloquent
glances
of
the
eye
for
with
jo
brain
developed
earlier
than
heart
and
she
preferred
imaginary
heroes
to
real
ones
because
when
tired
of
them
the
former
could
be
shut
up
in
the
tin-kitchen
till
called
for
and
the
latter
were
less
manageable
things
were
in
this
state
when
the
grand
discovery
was
made
and
jo
watched
laurie
that
night
as
she
had
never
done
before
if
she
had
not
got
the
new
idea
into
her
head
she
would
have
seen
nothing
unusual
in
the
fact
that
beth
was
very
quiet
and
laurie
very
kind
to
her
but
having
given
the
rein
to
her
lively
fancy
it
galloped
away
with
her
at
a
great
pace
and
common
sense
being
rather
weakened
by
a
long
course
of
romance
writing
did
not
come
to
the
rescue
as
usual
beth
lay
on
the
sofa
and
laurie
sat
in
a
low
chair
close
by
amusing
her
with
all
sorts
of
gossip
for
she
depended
on
her
weekly
spin
and
he
never
disappointed
her
but
that
evening
jo
fancied
that
beth's
eyes
rested
on
the
lively
dark
face
beside
her
with
peculiar
pleasure
and
that
she
listened
with
intense
interest
to
an
account
of
some
exciting
cricket-match
though
the
phrases
caught
off
a
tice
stumped
off
his
ground
and
the
leg
hit
for
three
were
as
intelligible
to
her
as
sanscrit
she
also
fancied
having
set
her
heart
upon
seeing
it
that
she
saw
a
certain
increase
of
gentleness
in
laurie's
manner
that
he
dropped
his
voice
now
and
then
laughed
less
than
usual
was
a
little
absent-minded
and
settled
the
afghan
over
beth's
feet
with
an
assiduity
that
was
really
almost
tender
who
knows
stranger
things
have
happened
thought
jo
as
she
fussed
about
the
room
she
will
make
quite
an
angel
of
him
and
he
will
make
life
delightfully
easy
and
pleasant
for
the
dear
if
they
only
love
each
other
i
don't
see
how
he
can
help
it
and
i
do
believe
he
would
if
the
rest
of
us
were
out
of
the
way
as
every
one
_was_
out
of
the
way
but
herself
jo
began
to
feel
that
she
ought
to
dispose
of
herself
with
all
speed
but
where
should
she
go
and
burning
to
lay
herself
upon
the
shrine
of
sisterly
devotion
she
sat
down
to
settle
that
point
now
the
old
sofa
was
a
regular
patriarch
of
a
sofa,--long
broad
well-cushioned
and
low
a
trifle
shabby
as
well
it
might
be
for
the
girls
had
slept
and
sprawled
on
it
as
babies
fished
over
the
back
rode
on
the
arms
and
had
menageries
under
it
as
children
and
rested
tired
heads
dreamed
dreams
and
listened
to
tender
talk
on
it
as
young
women
they
all
loved
it
for
it
was
a
family
refuge
and
one
corner
had
always
been
jo's
favorite
lounging-place
among
the
many
pillows
that
adorned
the
venerable
couch
was
one
hard
round
covered
with
prickly
horsehair
and
furnished
with
a
knobby
button
at
each
end
this
repulsive
pillow
was
her
especial
property
being
used
as
a
weapon
of
defence
a
barricade
or
a
stern
preventive
of
too
much
slumber
laurie
knew
this
pillow
well
and
had
cause
to
regard
it
with
deep
aversion
having
been
unmercifully
pummelled
with
it
in
former
days
when
romping
was
allowed
and
now
frequently
debarred
by
it
from
taking
the
seat
he
most
coveted
next
to
jo
in
the
sofa
corner
if
the
sausage
as
they
called
it
stood
on
end
it
was
a
sign
that
he
might
approach
and
repose
but
if
it
lay
flat
across
the
sofa
woe
to
the
man
woman
or
child
who
dared
disturb
it
that
evening
jo
forgot
to
barricade
her
corner
and
had
not
been
in
her
seat
five
minutes
before
a
massive
form
appeared
beside
her
and
with
both
arms
spread
over
the
sofa-back
both
long
legs
stretched
out
before
him
laurie
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction,--
now
_this_
is
filling
at
the
price
illustration
now
this
is
filling
at
the
price
no
slang
snapped
jo
slamming
down
the
pillow
but
it
was
too
late
there
was
no
room
for
it
and
coasting
on
to
the
floor
it
disappeared
in
a
most
mysterious
manner
come
jo
don't
be
thorny
after
studying
himself
to
a
skeleton
all
the
week
a
fellow
deserves
petting
and
ought
to
get
it
beth
will
pet
you
i'm
busy
no
she's
not
to
be
bothered
with
me
but
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
unless
you've
suddenly
lost
your
taste
for
it
have
you
do
you
hate
your
boy
and
want
to
fire
pillows
at
him
anything
more
wheedlesome
than
that
touching
appeal
was
seldom
heard
but
jo
quenched
her
boy
by
turning
on
him
with
the
stern
query,--
how
many
bouquets
have
you
sent
miss
randal
this
week
not
one
upon
my
word
she's
engaged
now
then
i'm
glad
of
it
that's
one
of
your
foolish
extravagances,--sending
flowers
and
things
to
girls
for
whom
you
don't
care
two
pins
continued
jo
reprovingly
sensible
girls
for
whom
i
do
care
whole
papers
of
pins
won't
let
me
send
them
'flowers
and
things,'
so
what
can
i
do
my
feelings
must
have
a
_went_
mother
doesn't
approve
of
flirting
even
in
fun
and
you
do
flirt
desperately
teddy
i'd
give
anything
if
i
could
answer
'so
do
you.'
as
i
can't
i'll
merely
say
that
i
don't
see
any
harm
in
that
pleasant
little
game
if
all
parties
understand
that
it's
only
play
well
it
does
look
pleasant
but
i
can't
learn
how
it's
done
i've
tried
because
one
feels
awkward
in
company
not
to
do
as
everybody
else
is
doing
but
i
don't
seem
to
get
on
said
jo
forgetting
to
play
mentor
take
lessons
of
amy
she
has
a
regular
talent
for
it
yes
she
does
it
very
prettily
and
never
seems
to
go
too
far
i
suppose
it's
natural
to
some
people
to
please
without
trying
and
others
to
always
say
and
do
the
wrong
thing
in
the
wrong
place
i'm
glad
you
can't
flirt
it's
really
refreshing
to
see
a
sensible
straightforward
girl
who
can
be
jolly
and
kind
without
making
a
fool
of
herself
between
ourselves
jo
some
of
the
girls
i
know
really
do
go
on
at
such
a
rate
i'm
ashamed
of
them
they
don't
mean
any
harm
i'm
sure
but
if
they
knew
how
we
fellows
talked
about
them
afterward
they'd
mend
their
ways
i
fancy
they
do
the
same
and
as
their
tongues
are
the
sharpest
you
fellows
get
the
worst
of
it
for
you
are
as
silly
as
they
every
bit
if
you
behaved
properly
they
would
but
knowing
you
like
their
nonsense
they
keep
it
up
and
then
you
blame
them
much
you
know
about
it
ma'am
said
laurie
in
a
superior
tone
we
don't
like
romps
and
flirts
though
we
may
act
as
if
we
did
sometimes
the
pretty
modest
girls
are
never
talked
about
except
respectfully
among
gentlemen
bless
your
innocent
soul
if
you
could
be
in
my
place
for
a
month
you'd
see
things
that
would
astonish
you
a
trifle
upon
my
word
when
i
see
one
of
those
harum-scarum
girls
i
always
want
to
say
with
our
friend
cock
robin,--
'out
upon
you
fie
upon
you
bold-faced
jig!'
it
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
at
the
funny
conflict
between
laurie's
chivalrous
reluctance
to
speak
ill
of
womankind
and
his
very
natural
dislike
of
the
unfeminine
folly
of
which
fashionable
society
showed
him
many
samples
jo
knew
that
young
laurence
was
regarded
as
a
most
eligible
_parti_
by
worldly
mammas
was
much
smiled
upon
by
their
daughters
and
flattered
enough
by
ladies
of
all
ages
to
make
a
coxcomb
of
him
so
she
watched
him
rather
jealously
fearing
he
would
be
spoilt
and
rejoiced
more
than
she
confessed
to
find
that
he
still
believed
in
modest
girls
returning
suddenly
to
her
admonitory
tone
she
said
dropping
her
voice
if
you
_must_
have
a
'went,'
teddy
go
and
devote
yourself
to
one
of
the
'pretty
modest
girls'
whom
you
do
respect
and
not
waste
your
time
with
the
silly
ones
you
really
advise
it
and
laurie
looked
at
her
with
an
odd
mixture
of
anxiety
and
merriment
in
his
face
yes
i
do
but
you'd
better
wait
till
you
are
through
college
on
the
whole
and
be
fitting
yourself
for
the
place
meantime
you're
not
half
good
enough
for--well
whoever
the
modest
girl
maybe
and
jo
looked
a
little
queer
likewise
for
a
name
had
almost
escaped
her
that
i'm
not
acquiesced
laurie
with
an
expression
of
humility
quite
new
to
him
as
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
absently
wound
jo's
apron-tassel
round
his
finger
mercy
on
us
this
will
never
do
thought
jo
adding
aloud
go
and
sing
to
me
i'm
dying
for
some
music
and
always
like
yours
i'd
rather
stay
here
thank
you
well
you
can't
there
isn't
room
go
and
make
yourself
useful
since
you
are
too
big
to
be
ornamental
i
thought
you
hated
to
be
tied
to
a
woman's
apron-string
retorted
jo
quoting
certain
rebellious
words
of
his
own
ah
that
depends
on
who
wears
the
apron
and
laurie
gave
an
audacious
tweak
at
the
tassel
are
you
going
demanded
jo
diving
for
the
pillow
he
fled
at
once
and
the
minute
it
was
well
up
with
the
bonnets
of
bonnie
dundee
she
slipped
away
to
return
no
more
till
the
young
gentleman
had
departed
in
high
dudgeon
illustration
up
with
the
bonnets
of
bonnie
dundee
jo
lay
long
awake
that
night
and
was
just
dropping
off
when
the
sound
of
a
stifled
sob
made
her
fly
to
beth's
bedside
with
the
anxious
inquiry
what
is
it
dear
i
thought
you
were
asleep
sobbed
beth
is
it
the
old
pain
my
precious
no
it's
a
new
one
but
i
can
bear
it
and
beth
tried
to
check
her
tears
tell
me
all
about
it
and
let
me
cure
it
as
i
often
did
the
other
you
can't
there
is
no
cure
there
beth's
voice
gave
way
and
clinging
to
her
sister
she
cried
so
despairingly
that
jo
was
frightened
where
is
it
shall
i
call
mother
beth
did
not
answer
the
first
question
but
in
the
dark
one
hand
went
involuntarily
to
her
heart
as
if
the
pain
were
there
with
the
other
she
held
jo
fast
whispering
eagerly
no
no
don't
call
her
don't
tell
her
i
shall
be
better
soon
lie
down
here
and
'poor'
my
head
i'll
be
quiet
and
go
to
sleep
indeed
i
will
jo
obeyed
but
as
her
hand
went
softly
to
and
fro
across
beth's
hot
forehead
and
wet
eyelids
her
heart
was
very
full
and
she
longed
to
speak
but
young
as
she
was
jo
had
learned
that
hearts
like
flowers
cannot
be
rudely
handled
but
must
open
naturally
so
though
she
believed
she
knew
the
cause
of
beth's
new
pain
she
only
said
in
her
tenderest
tone
does
anything
trouble
you
deary
yes
jo
after
a
long
pause
wouldn't
it
comfort
you
to
tell
me
what
it
is
not
now
not
yet
then
i
won't
ask
but
remember
bethy
that
mother
and
jo
are
always
glad
to
hear
and
help
you
if
they
can
i
know
it
i'll
tell
you
by
and
by
is
the
pain
better
now
oh
yes
much
better
you
are
so
comfortable
jo
go
to
sleep
dear
i'll
stay
with
you
so
cheek
to
cheek
they
fell
asleep
and
on
the
morrow
beth
seemed
quite
herself
again
for
at
eighteen
neither
heads
nor
hearts
ache
long
and
a
loving
word
can
medicine
most
ills
but
jo
had
made
up
her
mind
and
after
pondering
over
a
project
for
some
days
she
confided
it
to
her
mother
you
asked
me
the
other
day
what
my
wishes
were
i'll
tell
you
one
of
them
marmee
she
began
as
they
sat
alone
together
i
want
to
go
away
somewhere
this
winter
for
a
change
why
jo
and
her
mother
looked
up
quickly
as
if
the
words
suggested
a
double
meaning
with
her
eyes
on
her
work
jo
answered
soberly
i
want
something
new
i
feel
restless
and
anxious
to
be
seeing
doing
and
learning
more
than
i
am
i
brood
too
much
over
my
own
small
affairs
and
need
stirring
up
so
as
i
can
be
spared
this
winter
i'd
like
to
hop
a
little
way
and
try
my
wings
where
will
you
hop
to
new
york
i
had
a
bright
idea
yesterday
and
this
is
it
you
know
mrs
kirke
wrote
to
you
for
some
respectable
young
person
to
teach
her
children
and
sew
it's
rather
hard
to
find
just
the
thing
but
i
think
i
should
suit
if
i
tried
my
dear
go
out
to
service
in
that
great
boarding-house
and
mrs
march
looked
surprised
but
not
displeased
it's
not
exactly
going
out
to
service
for
mrs
kirke
is
your
friend,--the
kindest
soul
that
ever
lived,--and
would
make
things
pleasant
for
me
i
know
her
family
is
separate
from
the
rest
and
no
one
knows
me
there
don't
care
if
they
do
it's
honest
work
and
i'm
not
ashamed
of
it
nor
i
but
your
writing
all
the
better
for
the
change
i
shall
see
and
hear
new
things
get
new
ideas
and
even
if
i
haven't
much
time
there
i
shall
bring
home
quantities
of
material
for
my
rubbish
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
are
these
your
only
reasons
for
this
sudden
fancy
no
mother
may
i
know
the
others
jo
looked
up
and
jo
looked
down
then
said
slowly
with
sudden
color
in
her
cheeks
it
may
be
vain
and
wrong
to
say
it
but--i'm
afraid--laurie
is
getting
too
fond
of
me
then
you
don't
care
for
him
in
the
way
it
is
evident
he
begins
to
care
for
you
and
mrs
march
looked
anxious
as
she
put
the
question
mercy
no
i
love
the
dear
boy
as
i
always
have
and
am
immensely
proud
of
him
but
as
for
anything
more
it's
out
of
the
question
i'm
glad
of
that
jo
why
please
because
dear
i
don't
think
you
suited
to
one
another
as
friends
you
are
very
happy
and
your
frequent
quarrels
soon
blow
over
but
i
fear
you
would
both
rebel
if
you
were
mated
for
life
you
are
too
much
alike
and
too
fond
of
freedom
not
to
mention
hot
tempers
and
strong
wills
to
get
on
happily
together
in
a
relation
which
needs
infinite
patience
and
forbearance
as
well
as
love
that's
just
the
feeling
i
had
though
i
couldn't
express
it
i'm
glad
you
think
he
is
only
beginning
to
care
for
me
it
would
trouble
me
sadly
to
make
him
unhappy
for
i
couldn't
fall
in
love
with
the
dear
old
fellow
merely
out
of
gratitude
could
i
you
are
sure
of
his
feeling
for
you
the
color
deepened
in
jo's
cheeks
as
she
answered
with
the
look
of
mingled
pleasure
pride
and
pain
which
young
girls
wear
when
speaking
of
first
lovers,--
i'm
afraid
it
is
so
mother
he
hasn't
said
anything
but
he
looks
a
great
deal
i
think
i
had
better
go
away
before
it
comes
to
anything
i
agree
with
you
and
if
it
can
be
managed
you
shall
go
jo
looked
relieved
and
after
a
pause
said
smiling
how
mrs
moffat
would
wonder
at
your
want
of
management
if
she
knew
and
how
she
will
rejoice
that
annie
still
may
hope
ah
jo
mothers
may
differ
in
their
management
but
the
hope
is
the
same
in
all,--the
desire
to
see
their
children
happy
meg
is
so
and
i
am
content
with
her
success
you
i
leave
to
enjoy
your
liberty
till
you
tire
of
it
for
only
then
will
you
find
that
there
is
something
sweeter
amy
is
my
chief
care
now
but
her
good
sense
will
help
her
for
beth
i
indulge
no
hopes
except
that
she
may
be
well
by
the
way
she
seems
brighter
this
last
day
or
two
have
you
spoken
to
her
yes
she
owned
she
had
a
trouble
and
promised
to
tell
me
by
and
by
i
said
no
more
for
i
think
i
know
it
and
jo
told
her
little
story
mrs
march
shook
her
head
and
did
not
take
so
romantic
a
view
of
the
case
but
looked
grave
and
repeated
her
opinion
that
for
laurie's
sake
jo
should
go
away
for
a
time
let
us
say
nothing
about
it
to
him
till
the
plan
is
settled
then
i'll
run
away
before
he
can
collect
his
wits
and
be
tragical
beth
must
think
i'm
going
to
please
myself
as
i
am
for
i
can't
talk
about
laurie
to
her
but
she
can
pet
and
comfort
him
after
i'm
gone
and
so
cure
him
of
this
romantic
notion
he's
been
through
so
many
little
trials
of
the
sort
he's
used
to
it
and
will
soon
get
over
his
love-lornity
jo
spoke
hopefully
but
could
not
rid
herself
of
the
foreboding
fear
that
this
little
trial
would
be
harder
than
the
others
and
that
laurie
would
not
get
over
his
love-lornity
as
easily
as
heretofore
the
plan
was
talked
over
in
a
family
council
and
agreed
upon
for
mrs
kirke
gladly
accepted
jo
and
promised
to
make
a
pleasant
home
for
her
the
teaching
would
render
her
independent
and
such
leisure
as
she
got
might
be
made
profitable
by
writing
while
the
new
scenes
and
society
would
be
both
useful
and
agreeable
jo
liked
the
prospect
and
was
eager
to
be
gone
for
the
home-nest
was
growing
too
narrow
for
her
restless
nature
and
adventurous
spirit
when
all
was
settled
with
fear
and
trembling
she
told
laurie
but
to
her
surprise
he
took
it
very
quietly
he
had
been
graver
than
usual
of
late
but
very
pleasant
and
when
jokingly
accused
of
turning
over
a
new
leaf
he
answered
soberly
so
i
am
and
i
mean
this
one
shall
stay
turned
jo
was
very
much
relieved
that
one
of
his
virtuous
fits
should
come
on
just
then
and
made
her
preparations
with
a
lightened
heart,--for
beth
seemed
more
cheerful,--and
hoped
she
was
doing
the
best
for
all
one
thing
i
leave
to
your
especial
care
she
said
the
night
before
she
left
you
mean
your
papers
asked
beth
no
my
boy
be
very
good
to
him
won't
you
of
course
i
will
but
i
can't
fill
your
place
and
he'll
miss
you
sadly
it
won't
hurt
him
so
remember
i
leave
him
in
your
charge
to
plague
pet
and
keep
in
order
i'll
do
my
best
for
your
sake
promised
beth
wondering
why
jo
looked
at
her
so
queerly
when
laurie
said
good-by
he
whispered
significantly
it
won't
do
a
bit
of
good
jo
my
eye
is
on
you
so
mind
what
you
do
or
i'll
come
and
bring
you
home

xxxiii
jo's
journal
new
york
november
dear
marmee
and
beth,--
i'm
going
to
write
you
a
regular
volume
for
i've
got
heaps
to
tell
though
i'm
not
a
fine
young
lady
travelling
on
the
continent
when
i
lost
sight
of
father's
dear
old
face
i
felt
a
trifle
blue
and
might
have
shed
a
briny
drop
or
two
if
an
irish
lady
with
four
small
children
all
crying
more
or
less
hadn't
diverted
my
mind
for
i
amused
myself
by
dropping
gingerbread
nuts
over
the
seat
every
time
they
opened
their
mouths
to
roar
soon
the
sun
came
out
and
taking
it
as
a
good
omen
i
cleared
up
likewise
and
enjoyed
my
journey
with
all
my
heart
mrs
kirke
welcomed
me
so
kindly
i
felt
at
home
at
once
even
in
that
big
house
full
of
strangers
she
gave
me
a
funny
little
sky-parlor--all
she
had
but
there
is
a
stove
in
it
and
a
nice
table
in
a
sunny
window
so
i
can
sit
here
and
write
whenever
i
like
a
fine
view
and
a
church-tower
opposite
atone
for
the
many
stairs
and
i
took
a
fancy
to
my
den
on
the
spot
the
nursery
where
i
am
to
teach
and
sew
is
a
pleasant
room
next
mrs
kirke's
private
parlor
and
the
two
little
girls
are
pretty
children,--rather
spoilt
i
fancy
but
they
took
to
me
after
telling
them
'the
seven
bad
pigs;'
and
i've
no
doubt
i
shall
make
a
model
governess
i
am
to
have
my
meals
with
the
children
if
i
prefer
it
to
the
great
table
and
for
the
present
i
do
for
i
_am_
bashful
though
no
one
will
believe
it
'now
my
dear
make
yourself
at
home,'
said
mrs
k
in
her
motherly
way
'i'm
on
the
drive
from
morning
to
night
as
you
may
suppose
with
such
a
family
but
a
great
anxiety
will
be
off
my
mind
if
i
know
the
children
are
safe
with
you
my
rooms
are
always
open
to
you
and
your
own
shall
be
as
comfortable
as
i
can
make
it
there
are
some
pleasant
people
in
the
house
if
you
feel
sociable
and
your
evenings
are
always
free
come
to
me
if
anything
goes
wrong
and
be
as
happy
as
you
can
there's
the
tea-bell
i
must
run
and
change
my
cap;'
and
off
she
bustled
leaving
me
to
settle
myself
in
my
new
nest
as
i
went
downstairs
soon
after
i
saw
something
i
liked
the
flights
are
very
long
in
this
tall
house
and
as
i
stood
waiting
at
the
head
of
the
third
one
for
a
little
servant
girl
to
lumber
up
i
saw
a
gentleman
come
along
behind
her
take
the
heavy
hod
of
coal
out
of
her
hand
carry
it
all
the
way
up
put
it
down
at
a
door
near
by
and
walk
away
saying
with
a
kind
nod
and
a
foreign
accent,--
'it
goes
better
so
the
little
back
is
too
young
to
haf
such
heaviness.'
wasn't
it
good
of
him
i
like
such
things
for
as
father
says
trifles
show
character
when
i
mentioned
it
to
mrs
k
that
evening
she
laughed
and
said,--
'that
must
have
been
professor
bhaer
he's
always
doing
things
of
that
sort.'
mrs
k
told
me
he
was
from
berlin
very
learned
and
good
but
poor
as
a
church-mouse
and
gives
lessons
to
support
himself
and
two
little
orphan
nephews
whom
he
is
educating
here
according
to
the
wishes
of
his
sister
who
married
an
american
not
a
very
romantic
story
but
it
interested
me
and
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
mrs
k
lends
him
her
parlor
for
some
of
his
scholars
there
is
a
glass
door
between
it
and
the
nursery
and
i
mean
to
peep
at
him
and
then
i'll
tell
you
how
he
looks
he's
almost
forty
so
it's
no
harm
marmee
after
tea
and
a
go-to-bed
romp
with
the
little
girls
i
attacked
the
big
work-basket
and
had
a
quiet
evening
chatting
with
my
new
friend
i
shall
keep
a
journal-letter
and
send
it
once
a
week
so
good-night
and
more
to-morrow
_tuesday
eve._
had
a
lively
time
in
my
seminary
this
morning
for
the
children
acted
like
sancho
and
at
one
time
i
really
thought
i
should
shake
them
all
round
some
good
angel
inspired
me
to
try
gymnastics
and
i
kept
it
up
till
they
were
glad
to
sit
down
and
keep
still
after
luncheon
the
girl
took
them
out
for
a
walk
and
i
went
to
my
needle-work
like
little
mabel
'with
a
willing
mind.'
i
was
thanking
my
stars
that
i'd
learned
to
make
nice
button-holes
when
the
parlor-door
opened
and
shut
and
some
one
began
to
hum,--
'kennst
du
das
land,'
like
a
big
bumble-bee
it
was
dreadfully
improper
i
know
but
i
couldn't
resist
the
temptation
and
lifting
one
end
of
the
curtain
before
the
glass
door
i
peeped
in
professor
bhaer
was
there
and
while
he
arranged
his
books
i
took
a
good
look
at
him
a
regular
german,--rather
stout
with
brown
hair
tumbled
all
over
his
head
a
bushy
beard
good
nose
the
kindest
eyes
i
ever
saw
and
a
splendid
big
voice
that
does
one's
ears
good
after
our
sharp
or
slipshod
american
gabble
his
clothes
were
rusty
his
hands
were
large
and
he
hadn't
a
really
handsome
feature
in
his
face
except
his
beautiful
teeth
yet
i
liked
him
for
he
had
a
fine
head
his
linen
was
very
nice
and
he
looked
like
a
gentleman
though
two
buttons
were
off
his
coat
and
there
was
a
patch
on
one
shoe
he
looked
sober
in
spite
of
his
humming
till
he
went
to
the
window
to
turn
the
hyacinth
bulbs
toward
the
sun
and
stroke
the
cat
who
received
him
like
an
old
friend
then
he
smiled
and
when
a
tap
came
at
the
door
called
out
in
a
loud
brisk
tone,--
'herein!'
i
was
just
going
to
run
when
i
caught
sight
of
a
morsel
of
a
child
carrying
a
big
book
and
stopped
to
see
what
was
going
on
'me
wants
my
bhaer,'
said
the
mite
slamming
down
her
book
and
running
to
meet
him
'thou
shalt
haf
thy
bhaer
come
then
and
take
a
goot
hug
from
him
my
tina,'
said
the
professor
catching
her
up
with
a
laugh
and
holding
her
so
high
over
his
head
that
she
had
to
stoop
her
little
face
to
kiss
him
illustration
thou
shalt
haf
thy
bhaer
'now
me
mus
tuddy
my
lessin,'
went
on
the
funny
little
thing
so
he
put
her
up
at
the
table
opened
the
great
dictionary
she
had
brought
and
gave
her
a
paper
and
pencil
and
she
scribbled
away
turning
a
leaf
now
and
then
and
passing
her
little
fat
finger
down
the
page
as
if
finding
a
word
so
soberly
that
i
nearly
betrayed
myself
by
a
laugh
while
mr
bhaer
stood
stroking
her
pretty
hair
with
a
fatherly
look
that
made
me
think
she
must
be
his
own
though
she
looked
more
french
than
german
another
knock
and
the
appearance
of
two
young
ladies
sent
me
back
to
my
work
and
there
i
virtuously
remained
through
all
the
noise
and
gabbling
that
went
on
next
door
one
of
the
girls
kept
laughing
affectedly
and
saying
'now
professor,'
in
a
coquettish
tone
and
the
other
pronounced
her
german
with
an
accent
that
must
have
made
it
hard
for
him
to
keep
sober
both
seemed
to
try
his
patience
sorely
for
more
than
once
i
heard
him
say
emphatically
'no
no
it
is
_not_
so
you
haf
not
attend
to
what
i
say;'
and
once
there
was
a
loud
rap
as
if
he
struck
the
table
with
his
book
followed
by
the
despairing
exclamation
'prut
it
all
goes
bad
this
day.'
poor
man
i
pitied
him
and
when
the
girls
were
gone
took
just
one
more
peep
to
see
if
he
survived
it
he
seemed
to
have
thrown
himself
back
in
his
chair
tired
out
and
sat
there
with
his
eyes
shut
till
the
clock
struck
two
when
he
jumped
up
put
his
books
in
his
pocket
as
if
ready
for
another
lesson
and
taking
little
tina
who
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
in
his
arms
he
carried
her
quietly
away
i
fancy
he
has
a
hard
life
of
it
mrs
kirke
asked
me
if
i
wouldn't
go
down
to
the
five
o'clock
dinner
and
feeling
a
little
bit
homesick
i
thought
i
would
just
to
see
what
sort
of
people
are
under
the
same
roof
with
me
so
i
made
myself
respectable
and
tried
to
slip
in
behind
mrs
kirke
but
as
she
is
short
and
i'm
tall
my
efforts
at
concealment
were
rather
a
failure
she
gave
me
a
seat
by
her
and
after
my
face
cooled
off
i
plucked
up
courage
and
looked
about
me
the
long
table
was
full
and
every
one
intent
on
getting
their
dinner,--the
gentlemen
especially
who
seemed
to
be
eating
on
time
for
they
_bolted_
in
every
sense
of
the
word
vanishing
as
soon
as
they
were
done
there
was
the
usual
assortment
of
young
men
absorbed
in
themselves
young
couples
absorbed
in
each
other
married
ladies
in
their
babies
and
old
gentlemen
in
politics
i
don't
think
i
shall
care
to
have
much
to
do
with
any
of
them
except
one
sweet-faced
maiden
lady
who
looks
as
if
she
had
something
in
her
cast
away
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
table
was
the
professor
shouting
answers
to
the
questions
of
a
very
inquisitive
deaf
old
gentleman
on
one
side
and
talking
philosophy
with
a
frenchman
on
the
other
if
amy
had
been
here
she'd
have
turned
her
back
on
him
forever
because
sad
to
relate
he
had
a
great
appetite
and
shovelled
in
his
dinner
in
a
manner
which
would
have
horrified
'her
ladyship.'
i
didn't
mind
for
i
like
'to
see
folks
eat
with
a
relish,'
as
hannah
says
and
the
poor
man
must
have
needed
a
deal
of
food
after
teaching
idiots
all
day
as
i
went
upstairs
after
dinner
two
of
the
young
men
were
settling
their
hats
before
the
hall-mirror
and
i
heard
one
say
low
to
the
other
'who's
the
new
party?'
'governess
or
something
of
that
sort.'
'what
the
deuce
is
she
at
our
table
for?'
'friend
of
the
old
lady's.'
'handsome
head
but
no
style.'
'not
a
bit
of
it
give
us
a
light
and
come
on.'
i
felt
angry
at
first
and
then
i
didn't
care
for
a
governess
is
as
good
as
a
clerk
and
i've
got
sense
if
i
haven't
style
which
is
more
than
some
people
have
judging
from
the
remarks
of
the
elegant
beings
who
clattered
away
smoking
like
bad
chimneys
i
hate
ordinary
people
_thursday._
yesterday
was
a
quiet
day
spent
in
teaching
sewing
and
writing
in
my
little
room
which
is
very
cosey
with
a
light
and
fire
i
picked
up
a
few
bits
of
news
and
was
introduced
to
the
professor
it
seems
that
tina
is
the
child
of
the
frenchwoman
who
does
the
fine
ironing
in
the
laundry
here
the
little
thing
has
lost
her
heart
to
mr
bhaer
and
follows
him
about
the
house
like
a
dog
whenever
he
is
at
home
which
delights
him
as
he
is
very
fond
of
children
though
a
'bacheldore.'
kitty
and
minnie
kirke
likewise
regard
him
with
affection
and
tell
all
sorts
of
stories
about
the
plays
he
invents
the
presents
he
brings
and
the
splendid
tales
he
tells
the
young
men
quiz
him
it
seems
call
him
old
fritz
lager
beer
ursa
major
and
make
all
manner
of
jokes
on
his
name
but
he
enjoys
it
like
a
boy
mrs
k
says
and
takes
it
so
good-naturedly
that
they
all
like
him
in
spite
of
his
foreign
ways
the
maiden
lady
is
a
miss
norton,--rich
cultivated
and
kind
she
spoke
to
me
at
dinner
to-day
for
i
went
to
table
again
it's
such
fun
to
watch
people
and
asked
me
to
come
and
see
her
at
her
room
she
has
fine
books
and
pictures
knows
interesting
persons
and
seems
friendly
so
i
shall
make
myself
agreeable
for
i
_do_
want
to
get
into
good
society
only
it
isn't
the
same
sort
that
amy
likes
i
was
in
our
parlor
last
evening
when
mr
bhaer
came
in
with
some
newspapers
for
mrs
kirke
she
wasn't
there
but
minnie
who
is
a
little
old
woman
introduced
me
very
prettily
'this
is
mamma's
friend
miss
march.'
'yes
and
she's
jolly
and
we
like
her
lots,'
added
kitty
who
is
an
_enfant
terrible_
we
both
bowed
and
then
we
laughed
for
the
prim
introduction
and
the
blunt
addition
were
rather
a
comical
contrast
'ah
yes
i
hear
these
naughty
ones
go
to
vex
you
mees
marsch
if
so
again
call
at
me
and
i
come,'
he
said
with
a
threatening
frown
that
delighted
the
little
wretches
i
promised
i
would
and
he
departed
but
it
seems
as
if
i
was
doomed
to
see
a
good
deal
of
him
for
to-day
as
i
passed
his
door
on
my
way
out
by
accident
i
knocked
against
it
with
my
umbrella
it
flew
open
and
there
he
stood
in
his
dressing
gown
with
a
big
blue
sock
on
one
hand
and
a
darning-needle
in
the
other
he
didn't
seem
at
all
ashamed
of
it
for
when
i
explained
and
hurried
on
he
waved
his
hand
sock
and
all
saying
in
his
loud
cheerful
way,--
illustration
he
waved
his
hand
sock
and
all
'you
haf
a
fine
day
to
make
your
walk
_bon
voyage
mademoiselle._'
i
laughed
all
the
way
downstairs
but
it
was
a
little
pathetic
also
to
think
of
the
poor
man
having
to
mend
his
own
clothes
the
german
gentlemen
embroider
i
know
but
darning
hose
is
another
thing
and
not
so
pretty
_saturday._
nothing
has
happened
to
write
about
except
a
call
on
miss
norton
who
has
a
room
full
of
lovely
things
and
who
was
very
charming
for
she
showed
me
all
her
treasures
and
asked
me
if
i
would
sometimes
go
with
her
to
lectures
and
concerts
as
her
escort,--if
i
enjoyed
them
she
put
it
as
a
favor
but
i'm
sure
mrs
kirke
has
told
her
about
us
and
she
does
it
out
of
kindness
to
me
i'm
as
proud
as
lucifer
but
such
favors
from
such
people
don't
burden
me
and
i
accepted
gratefully
when
i
got
back
to
the
nursery
there
was
such
an
uproar
in
the
parlor
that
i
looked
in
and
there
was
mr
bhaer
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
with
tina
on
his
back
kitty
leading
him
with
a
jump-rope
and
minnie
feeding
two
small
boys
with
seed-cakes
as
they
roared
and
ramped
in
cages
built
of
chairs
'we
are
playing
_nargerie_,'
explained
kitty
'dis
is
mine
effalunt!'
added
tina
holding
on
by
the
professor's
hair
illustration
dis
is
mine
effalunt
'mamma
always
allows
us
to
do
what
we
like
saturday
afternoon
when
franz
and
emil
come
doesn't
she
mr
bhaer?'
said
minnie
the
'effalunt'
sat
up
looking
as
much
in
earnest
as
any
of
them
and
said
soberly
to
me,--
'i
gif
you
my
wort
it
is
so
if
we
make
too
large
a
noise
you
shall
say
hush
to
us
and
we
go
more
softly.'
i
promised
to
do
so
but
left
the
door
open
and
enjoyed
the
fun
as
much
as
they
did,--for
a
more
glorious
frolic
i
never
witnessed
they
played
tag
and
soldiers
danced
and
sung
and
when
it
began
to
grow
dark
they
all
piled
on
to
the
sofa
about
the
professor
while
he
told
charming
fairy
stories
of
the
storks
on
the
chimney-tops
and
the
little
'kobolds,'
who
ride
the
snow-flakes
as
they
fall
i
wish
americans
were
as
simple
and
natural
as
germans
don't
you
i'm
so
fond
of
writing
i
should
go
spinning
on
forever
if
motives
of
economy
didn't
stop
me
for
though
i've
used
thin
paper
and
written
fine
i
tremble
to
think
of
the
stamps
this
long
letter
will
need
pray
forward
amy's
as
soon
as
you
can
spare
them
my
small
news
will
sound
very
flat
after
her
splendors
but
you
will
like
them
i
know
is
teddy
studying
so
hard
that
he
can't
find
time
to
write
to
his
friends
take
good
care
of
him
for
me
beth
and
tell
me
all
about
the
babies
and
give
heaps
of
love
to
every
one
from
your
faithful
jo
p
s
on
reading
over
my
letter
it
strikes
me
as
rather
bhaery
but
i
am
always
interested
in
odd
people
and
i
really
had
nothing
else
to
write
about
bless
you
december
my
precious
betsey,--
as
this
is
to
be
a
scribble-scrabble
letter
i
direct
it
to
you
for
it
may
amuse
you
and
give
you
some
idea
of
my
goings
on
for
though
quiet
they
are
rather
amusing
for
which
oh
be
joyful
after
what
amy
would
call
herculaneum
efforts
in
the
way
of
mental
and
moral
agriculture
my
young
ideas
begin
to
shoot
and
my
little
twigs
to
bend
as
i
could
wish
they
are
not
so
interesting
to
me
as
tina
and
the
boys
but
i
do
my
duty
by
them
and
they
are
fond
of
me
franz
and
emil
are
jolly
little
lads
quite
after
my
own
heart
for
the
mixture
of
german
and
american
spirit
in
them
produces
a
constant
state
of
effervescence
saturday
afternoons
are
riotous
times
whether
spent
in
the
house
or
out
for
on
pleasant
days
they
all
go
to
walk
like
a
seminary
with
the
professor
and
myself
to
keep
order
and
then
such
fun
we
are
very
good
friends
now
and
i've
begun
to
take
lessons
i
really
couldn't
help
it
and
it
all
came
about
in
such
a
droll
way
that
i
must
tell
you
to
begin
at
the
beginning
mrs
kirke
called
to
me
one
day
as
i
passed
mr
bhaer's
room
where
she
was
rummaging
'did
you
ever
see
such
a
den
my
dear
just
come
and
help
me
put
these
books
to
rights
for
i've
turned
everything
upside
down
trying
to
discover
what
he
has
done
with
the
six
new
handkerchiefs
i
gave
him
not
long
ago.'
i
went
in
and
while
we
worked
i
looked
about
me
for
it
was
'a
den,'
to
be
sure
books
and
papers
everywhere
a
broken
meerschaum
and
an
old
flute
over
the
mantel-piece
as
if
done
with
a
ragged
bird
without
any
tail
chirped
on
one
window-seat
and
a
box
of
white
mice
adorned
the
other
half-finished
boats
and
bits
of
string
lay
among
the
manuscripts
dirty
little
boots
stood
drying
before
the
fire
and
traces
of
the
dearly
beloved
boys
for
whom
he
makes
a
slave
of
himself
were
to
be
seen
all
over
the
room
after
a
grand
rummage
three
of
the
missing
articles
were
found,--one
over
the
bird-cage
one
covered
with
ink
and
a
third
burnt
brown
having
been
used
as
a
holder
'such
a
man!'
laughed
good-natured
mrs
k
as
she
put
the
relics
in
the
rag-bag
'i
suppose
the
others
are
torn
up
to
rig
ships
bandage
cut
fingers
or
make
kite-tails
it's
dreadful
but
i
can't
scold
him
he's
so
absent-minded
and
good-natured
he
lets
those
boys
ride
over
him
rough-shod
i
agreed
to
do
his
washing
and
mending
but
he
forgets
to
give
out
his
things
and
i
forget
to
look
them
over
so
he
comes
to
a
sad
pass
sometimes.'
'let
me
mend
them,'
said
i
'i
don't
mind
it
and
he
needn't
know
i'd
like
to,--he's
so
kind
to
me
about
bringing
my
letters
and
lending
books.'
so
i
have
got
his
things
in
order
and
knit
heels
into
two
pairs
of
the
socks,--for
they
were
boggled
out
of
shape
with
his
queer
darns
nothing
was
said
and
i
hoped
he
wouldn't
find
it
out
but
one
day
last
week
he
caught
me
at
it
hearing
the
lessons
he
gives
to
others
has
interested
and
amused
me
so
much
that
i
took
a
fancy
to
learn
for
tina
runs
in
and
out
leaving
the
door
open
and
i
can
hear
i
had
been
sitting
near
this
door
finishing
off
the
last
sock
and
trying
to
understand
what
he
said
to
a
new
scholar
who
is
as
stupid
as
i
am
the
girl
had
gone
and
i
thought
he
had
also
it
was
so
still
and
i
was
busily
gabbling
over
a
verb
and
rocking
to
and
fro
in
a
most
absurd
way
when
a
little
crow
made
me
look
up
and
there
was
mr
bhaer
looking
and
laughing
quietly
while
he
made
signs
to
tina
not
to
betray
him
'so!'
he
said
as
i
stopped
and
stared
like
a
goose
'you
peep
at
me
i
peep
at
you
and
that
is
not
bad
but
see
i
am
not
pleasanting
when
i
say
haf
you
a
wish
for
german?'
'yes
but
you
are
too
busy
i
am
too
stupid
to
learn,'
i
blundered
out
as
red
as
a
peony
'prut
we
will
make
the
time
and
we
fail
not
to
find
the
sense
at
efening
i
shall
gif
a
little
lesson
with
much
gladness
for
look
you
mees
marsch
i
haf
this
debt
to
pay,'
and
he
pointed
to
my
work
'yes
they
say
to
one
another
these
so
kind
ladies
he
is
a
stupid
old
fellow
he
will
see
not
what
we
do
he
will
never
opserve
that
his
sock-heels
go
not
in
holes
any
more
he
will
think
his
buttons
grow
out
new
when
they
fall
and
believe
that
strings
make
theirselves
ah
but
i
haf
an
eye
and
i
see
much
i
haf
a
heart
and
i
feel
the
thanks
for
this
come
a
little
lesson
then
and
now
or
no
more
good
fairy
works
for
me
and
mine.'
of
course
i
couldn't
say
anything
after
that
and
as
it
really
is
a
splendid
opportunity
i
made
the
bargain
and
we
began
i
took
four
lessons
and
then
i
stuck
fast
in
a
grammatical
bog
the
professor
was
very
patient
with
me
but
it
must
have
been
torment
to
him
and
now
and
then
he'd
look
at
me
with
such
an
expression
of
mild
despair
that
it
was
a
toss-up
with
me
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
i
tried
both
ways
and
when
it
came
to
a
sniff
of
utter
mortification
and
woe
he
just
threw
the
grammar
on
to
the
floor
and
marched
out
of
the
room
i
felt
myself
disgraced
and
deserted
forever
but
didn't
blame
him
a
particle
and
was
scrambling
my
papers
together
meaning
to
rush
upstairs
and
shake
myself
hard
when
in
he
came
as
brisk
and
beaming
as
if
i'd
covered
myself
with
glory
'now
we
shall
try
a
new
way
you
and
i
will
read
these
pleasant
little
märchen
together
and
dig
no
more
in
that
dry
book
that
goes
in
the
corner
for
making
us
trouble.'
he
spoke
so
kindly
and
opened
hans
andersen's
fairy
tales
so
invitingly
before
me
that
i
was
more
ashamed
than
ever
and
went
at
my
lesson
in
a
neck-or-nothing
style
that
seemed
to
amuse
him
immensely
i
forgot
my
bashfulness
and
pegged
away
no
other
word
will
express
it
with
all
my
might
tumbling
over
long
words
pronouncing
according
to
the
inspiration
of
the
minute
and
doing
my
very
best
when
i
finished
reading
my
first
page
and
stopped
for
breath
he
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
out
in
his
hearty
way
'das
ist
gute
now
we
go
well
my
turn
i
do
him
in
german
gif
me
your
ear.'
and
away
he
went
rumbling
out
the
words
with
his
strong
voice
and
a
relish
which
was
good
to
see
as
well
as
hear
fortunately
the
story
was
the
'constant
tin
soldier,'
which
is
droll
you
know
so
i
could
laugh,--and
i
did,--though
i
didn't
understand
half
he
read
for
i
couldn't
help
it
he
was
so
earnest
i
so
excited
and
the
whole
thing
so
comical
after
that
we
got
on
better
and
now
i
read
my
lessons
pretty
well
for
this
way
of
studying
suits
me
and
i
can
see
that
the
grammar
gets
tucked
into
the
tales
and
poetry
as
one
gives
pills
in
jelly
i
like
it
very
much
and
he
doesn't
seem
tired
of
it
yet,--which
is
very
good
of
him
isn't
it
i
mean
to
give
him
something
on
christmas
for
i
dare
not
offer
money
tell
me
something
nice
marmee
i'm
glad
laurie
seems
so
happy
and
busy
that
he
has
given
up
smoking
and
lets
his
hair
grow
you
see
beth
manages
him
better
than
i
did
i'm
not
jealous
dear
do
your
best
only
don't
make
a
saint
of
him
i'm
afraid
i
couldn't
like
him
without
a
spice
of
human
naughtiness
read
him
bits
of
my
letters
i
haven't
time
to
write
much
and
that
will
do
just
as
well
thank
heaven
beth
continues
so
comfortable
january
a
happy
new
year
to
you
all
my
dearest
family
which
of
course
includes
mr
l
and
a
young
man
by
the
name
of
teddy
i
can't
tell
you
how
much
i
enjoyed
your
christmas
bundle
for
i
didn't
get
it
till
night
and
had
given
up
hoping
your
letter
came
in
the
morning
but
you
said
nothing
about
a
parcel
meaning
it
for
a
surprise
so
i
was
disappointed
for
i'd
had
a
'kind
of
a
feeling'
that
you
wouldn't
forget
me
i
felt
a
little
low
in
my
mind
as
i
sat
up
in
my
room
after
tea
and
when
the
big
muddy
battered-looking
bundle
was
brought
to
me
i
just
hugged
it
and
pranced
it
was
so
_homey_
and
refreshing
that
i
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
read
and
looked
and
ate
and
laughed
and
cried
in
my
usual
absurd
way
the
things
were
just
what
i
wanted
and
all
the
better
for
being
made
instead
of
bought
beth's
new
'ink-bib'
was
capital
and
hannah's
box
of
hard
gingerbread
will
be
a
treasure
i'll
be
sure
and
wear
the
nice
flannels
you
sent
marmee
and
read
carefully
the
books
father
has
marked
thank
you
all
heaps
and
heaps
illustration
i
sat
down
upon
the
floor
and
read
and
looked
and
ate
speaking
of
books
reminds
me
that
i'm
getting
rich
in
that
line
for
on
new
year's
day
mr
bhaer
gave
me
a
fine
shakespeare
it
is
one
he
values
much
and
i've
often
admired
it
set
up
in
the
place
of
honor
with
his
german
bible
plato
homer
and
milton
so
you
may
imagine
how
i
felt
when
he
brought
it
down
without
its
cover
and
showed
me
my
name
in
it
'from
my
friend
friedrich
bhaer.'
'you
say
often
you
wish
a
library
here
i
gif
you
one
for
between
these
lids
he
meant
covers
is
many
books
in
one
read
him
well
and
he
will
help
you
much
for
the
study
of
character
in
this
book
will
help
you
to
read
it
in
the
world
and
paint
it
with
your
pen.'
i
thanked
him
as
well
as
i
could
and
talk
now
about
'my
library,'
as
if
i
had
a
hundred
books
i
never
knew
how
much
there
was
in
shakespeare
before
but
then
i
never
had
a
bhaer
to
explain
it
to
me
now
_don't_
laugh
at
his
horrid
name
it
isn't
pronounced
either
bear
or
beer
as
people
_will_
say
it
but
something
between
the
two
as
only
germans
can
give
it
i'm
glad
you
both
like
what
i
tell
you
about
him
and
hope
you
will
know
him
some
day
mother
would
admire
his
warm
heart
father
his
wise
head
i
admire
both
and
feel
rich
in
my
new
'friend
friedrich
bhaer.'
not
having
much
money
or
knowing
what
he'd
like
i
got
several
little
things
and
put
them
about
the
room
where
he
would
find
them
unexpectedly
they
were
useful
pretty
or
funny,--a
new
standish
on
his
table
a
little
vase
for
his
flower,--he
always
has
one
or
a
bit
of
green
in
a
glass
to
keep
him
fresh
he
says,--and
a
holder
for
his
blower
so
that
he
needn't
burn
up
what
amy
calls
'mouchoirs.'
i
made
it
like
those
beth
invented,--a
big
butterfly
with
a
fat
body
and
black
and
yellow
wings
worsted
feelers
and
bead
eyes
it
took
his
fancy
immensely
and
he
put
it
on
his
mantel-piece
as
an
article
of
_vertu_
so
it
was
rather
a
failure
after
all
poor
as
he
is
he
didn't
forget
a
servant
or
a
child
in
the
house
and
not
a
soul
here
from
the
french
laundry-woman
to
miss
norton
forgot
him
i
was
so
glad
of
that
they
got
up
a
masquerade
and
had
a
gay
time
new
year's
eve
i
didn't
mean
to
go
down
having
no
dress
but
at
the
last
minute
mrs
kirke
remembered
some
old
brocades
and
miss
norton
lent
me
lace
and
feathers
so
i
dressed
up
as
mrs
malaprop
and
sailed
in
with
a
mask
on
no
one
knew
me
for
i
disguised
my
voice
and
no
one
dreamed
of
the
silent
haughty
miss
march
for
they
think
i
am
very
stiff
and
cool
most
of
them
and
so
i
am
to
whipper-snappers
could
dance
and
dress
and
burst
out
into
a
'nice
derangement
of
epitaphs
like
an
allegory
on
the
banks
of
the
nile.'
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
when
we
unmasked
it
was
fun
to
see
them
stare
at
me
i
heard
one
of
the
young
men
tell
another
that
he
knew
i'd
been
an
actress
in
fact
he
thought
he
remembered
seeing
me
at
one
of
the
minor
theatres
meg
will
relish
that
joke
mr
bhaer
was
nick
bottom
and
tina
was
titania,--a
perfect
little
fairy
in
his
arms
to
see
them
dance
was
'quite
a
landscape,'
to
use
a
teddyism
i
had
a
very
happy
new
year
after
all
and
when
i
thought
it
over
in
my
room
i
felt
as
if
i
was
getting
on
a
little
in
spite
of
my
many
failures
for
i'm
cheerful
all
the
time
now
work
with
a
will
and
take
more
interest
in
other
people
than
i
used
to
which
is
satisfactory
bless
you
all
ever
your
loving

illustration
tail-piece
illustration
in
the
presence
of
three
gentlemen
xxxiv
a
friend
though
very
happy
in
the
social
atmosphere
about
her
and
very
busy
with
the
daily
work
that
earned
her
bread
and
made
it
sweeter
for
the
effort
jo
still
found
time
for
literary
labors
the
purpose
which
now
took
possession
of
her
was
a
natural
one
to
a
poor
and
ambitious
girl
but
the
means
she
took
to
gain
her
end
were
not
the
best
she
saw
that
money
conferred
power
money
and
power
therefore
she
resolved
to
have
not
to
be
used
for
herself
alone
but
for
those
whom
she
loved
more
than
self
the
dream
of
filling
home
with
comforts
giving
beth
everything
she
wanted
from
strawberries
in
winter
to
an
organ
in
her
bedroom
going
abroad
herself
and
always
having
_more_
than
enough
so
that
she
might
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
charity
had
been
for
years
jo's
most
cherished
castle
in
the
air
the
prize-story
experience
had
seemed
to
open
a
way
which
might
after
long
travelling
and
much
up-hill
work
lead
to
this
delightful
_château
en
espagne_
but
the
novel
disaster
quenched
her
courage
for
a
time
for
public
opinion
is
a
giant
which
has
frightened
stouter-hearted
jacks
on
bigger
bean-stalks
than
hers
like
that
immortal
hero
she
reposed
awhile
after
the
first
attempt
which
resulted
in
a
tumble
and
the
least
lovely
of
the
giant's
treasures
if
i
remember
rightly
but
the
up
again
and
take
another
spirit
was
as
strong
in
jo
as
in
jack
so
she
scrambled
up
on
the
shady
side
this
time
and
got
more
booty
but
nearly
left
behind
her
what
was
far
more
precious
than
the
money-bags
she
took
to
writing
sensation
stories
for
in
those
dark
ages
even
all-perfect
america
read
rubbish
she
told
no
one
but
concocted
a
thrilling
tale
and
boldly
carried
it
herself
to
mr
dashwood
editor
of
the
weekly
volcano
she
had
never
read
sartor
resartus
but
she
had
a
womanly
instinct
that
clothes
possess
an
influence
more
powerful
over
many
than
the
worth
of
character
or
the
magic
of
manners
so
she
dressed
herself
in
her
best
and
trying
to
persuade
herself
that
she
was
neither
excited
nor
nervous
bravely
climbed
two
pairs
of
dark
and
dirty
stairs
to
find
herself
in
a
disorderly
room
a
cloud
of
cigar-smoke
and
the
presence
of
three
gentlemen
sitting
with
their
heels
rather
higher
than
their
hats
which
articles
of
dress
none
of
them
took
the
trouble
to
remove
on
her
appearance
somewhat
daunted
by
this
reception
jo
hesitated
on
the
threshold
murmuring
in
much
embarrassment,--
excuse
me
i
was
looking
for
the
'weekly
volcano'
office
i
wished
to
see
mr
dashwood
down
went
the
highest
pair
of
heels
up
rose
the
smokiest
gentleman
and
carefully
cherishing
his
cigar
between
his
fingers
he
advanced
with
a
nod
and
a
countenance
expressive
of
nothing
but
sleep
feeling
that
she
must
get
through
the
matter
somehow
jo
produced
her
manuscript
and
blushing
redder
and
redder
with
each
sentence
blundered
out
fragments
of
the
little
speech
carefully
prepared
for
the
occasion
a
friend
of
mine
desired
me
to
offer--a
story--just
as
an
experiment--would
like
your
opinion--be
glad
to
write
more
if
this
suits
while
she
blushed
and
blundered
mr
dashwood
had
taken
the
manuscript
and
was
turning
over
the
leaves
with
a
pair
of
rather
dirty
fingers
and
casting
critical
glances
up
and
down
the
neat
pages
not
a
first
attempt
i
take
it
observing
that
the
pages
were
numbered
covered
only
on
one
side
and
not
tied
up
with
a
ribbon,--sure
sign
of
a
novice
no
sir
she
has
had
some
experience
and
got
a
prize
for
a
tale
in
the
'blarneystone
banner.'
oh
did
she
and
mr
dashwood
gave
jo
a
quick
look
which
seemed
to
take
note
of
everything
she
had
on
from
the
bow
in
her
bonnet
to
the
buttons
on
her
boots
well
you
can
leave
it
if
you
like
we've
more
of
this
sort
of
thing
on
hand
than
we
know
what
to
do
with
at
present
but
i'll
run
my
eye
over
it
and
give
you
an
answer
next
week
now
jo
did
_not_
like
to
leave
it
for
mr
dashwood
didn't
suit
her
at
all
but
under
the
circumstances
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
but
bow
and
walk
away
looking
particularly
tall
and
dignified
as
she
was
apt
to
do
when
nettled
or
abashed
just
then
she
was
both
for
it
was
perfectly
evident
from
the
knowing
glances
exchanged
among
the
gentlemen
that
her
little
fiction
of
my
friend
was
considered
a
good
joke
and
a
laugh
produced
by
some
inaudible
remark
of
the
editor
as
he
closed
the
door
completed
her
discomfiture
half
resolving
never
to
return
she
went
home
and
worked
off
her
irritation
by
stitching
pinafores
vigorously
and
in
an
hour
or
two
was
cool
enough
to
laugh
over
the
scene
and
long
for
next
week
when
she
went
again
mr
dashwood
was
alone
whereat
she
rejoiced
mr
dashwood
was
much
wider
awake
than
before
which
was
agreeable
and
mr
dashwood
was
not
too
deeply
absorbed
in
a
cigar
to
remember
his
manners
so
the
second
interview
was
much
more
comfortable
than
the
first
we'll
take
this
editors
never
say
i
if
you
don't
object
to
a
few
alterations
it's
too
long
but
omitting
the
passages
i've
marked
will
make
it
just
the
right
length
he
said
in
a
business-like
tone
jo
hardly
knew
her
own
ms
again
so
crumpled
and
underscored
were
its
pages
and
paragraphs
but
feeling
as
a
tender
parent
might
on
being
asked
to
cut
off
her
baby's
legs
in
order
that
it
might
fit
into
a
new
cradle
she
looked
at
the
marked
passages
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
all
the
moral
reflections--which
she
had
carefully
put
in
as
ballast
for
much
romance--had
been
stricken
out
but
sir
i
thought
every
story
should
have
some
sort
of
a
moral
so
i
took
care
to
have
a
few
of
my
sinners
repent
mr
dashwood's
editorial
gravity
relaxed
into
a
smile
for
jo
had
forgotten
her
friend
and
spoken
as
only
an
author
could
people
want
to
be
amused
not
preached
at
you
know
morals
don't
sell
nowadays
which
was
not
quite
a
correct
statement
by
the
way
you
think
it
would
do
with
these
alterations
then
yes
it's
a
new
plot
and
pretty
well
worked
up--language
good
and
so
on
was
mr
dashwood's
affable
reply
what
do
you--that
is
what
compensation--
began
jo
not
exactly
knowing
how
to
express
herself
oh
yes
well
we
give
from
twenty-five
to
thirty
for
things
of
this
sort
pay
when
it
comes
out
returned
mr
dashwood
as
if
that
point
had
escaped
him
such
trifles
often
do
escape
the
editorial
mind
it
is
said
very
well
you
can
have
it
said
jo
handing
back
the
story
with
a
satisfied
air
for
after
the
dollar-a-column
work
even
twenty-five
seemed
good
pay
shall
i
tell
my
friend
you
will
take
another
if
she
has
one
better
than
this
asked
jo
unconscious
of
her
little
slip
of
the
tongue
and
emboldened
by
her
success
well
we'll
look
at
it
can't
promise
to
take
it
tell
her
to
make
it
short
and
spicy
and
never
mind
the
moral
what
name
would
your
friend
like
to
put
to
it
in
a
careless
tone
none
at
all
if
you
please
she
doesn't
wish
her
name
to
appear
and
has
no
_nom
de
plume_
said
jo
blushing
in
spite
of
herself
just
as
she
likes
of
course
the
tale
will
be
out
next
week
will
you
call
for
the
money
or
shall
i
send
it
asked
mr
dashwood
who
felt
a
natural
desire
to
know
who
his
new
contributor
might
be
i'll
call
good
morning
sir
as
she
departed
mr
dashwood
put
up
his
feet
with
the
graceful
remark
poor
and
proud
as
usual
but
she'll
do
following
mr
dashwood's
directions
and
making
mrs
northbury
her
model
jo
rashly
took
a
plunge
into
the
frothy
sea
of
sensational
literature
but
thanks
to
the
life-preserver
thrown
her
by
a
friend
she
came
up
again
not
much
the
worse
for
her
ducking
like
most
young
scribblers
she
went
abroad
for
her
characters
and
scenery
and
banditti
counts
gypsies
nuns
and
duchesses
appeared
upon
her
stage
and
played
their
parts
with
as
much
accuracy
and
spirit
as
could
be
expected
her
readers
were
not
particular
about
such
trifles
as
grammar
punctuation
and
probability
and
mr
dashwood
graciously
permitted
her
to
fill
his
columns
at
the
lowest
prices
not
thinking
it
necessary
to
tell
her
that
the
real
cause
of
his
hospitality
was
the
fact
that
one
of
his
hacks
on
being
offered
higher
wages
had
basely
left
him
in
the
lurch
she
soon
became
interested
in
her
work
for
her
emaciated
purse
grew
stout
and
the
little
hoard
she
was
making
to
take
beth
to
the
mountains
next
summer
grew
slowly
but
surely
as
the
weeks
passed
one
thing
disturbed
her
satisfaction
and
that
was
that
she
did
not
tell
them
at
home
she
had
a
feeling
that
father
and
mother
would
not
approve
and
preferred
to
have
her
own
way
first
and
beg
pardon
afterward
it
was
easy
to
keep
her
secret
for
no
name
appeared
with
her
stories
mr
dashwood
had
of
course
found
it
out
very
soon
but
promised
to
be
dumb
and
for
a
wonder
kept
his
word
she
thought
it
would
do
her
no
harm
for
she
sincerely
meant
to
write
nothing
of
which
she
should
be
ashamed
and
quieted
all
pricks
of
conscience
by
anticipations
of
the
happy
minute
when
she
should
show
her
earnings
and
laugh
over
her
well-kept
secret
but
mr
dashwood
rejected
any
but
thrilling
tales
and
as
thrills
could
not
be
produced
except
by
harrowing
up
the
souls
of
the
readers
history
and
romance
land
and
sea
science
and
art
police
records
and
lunatic
asylums
had
to
be
ransacked
for
the
purpose
jo
soon
found
that
her
innocent
experience
had
given
her
but
few
glimpses
of
the
tragic
world
which
underlies
society
so
regarding
it
in
a
business
light
she
set
about
supplying
her
deficiencies
with
characteristic
energy
eager
to
find
material
for
stories
and
bent
on
making
them
original
in
plot
if
not
masterly
in
execution
she
searched
newspapers
for
accidents
incidents
and
crimes
she
excited
the
suspicions
of
public
librarians
by
asking
for
works
on
poisons
she
studied
faces
in
the
street
and
characters
good
bad
and
indifferent
all
about
her
she
delved
in
the
dust
of
ancient
times
for
facts
or
fictions
so
old
that
they
were
as
good
as
new
and
introduced
herself
to
folly
sin
and
misery
as
well
as
her
limited
opportunities
allowed
she
thought
she
was
prospering
finely
but
unconsciously
she
was
beginning
to
desecrate
some
of
the
womanliest
attributes
of
a
woman's
character
she
was
living
in
bad
society
and
imaginary
though
it
was
its
influence
affected
her
for
she
was
feeding
heart
and
fancy
on
dangerous
and
unsubstantial
food
and
was
fast
brushing
the
innocent
bloom
from
her
nature
by
a
premature
acquaintance
with
the
darker
side
of
life
which
comes
soon
enough
to
all
of
us
she
was
beginning
to
feel
rather
than
see
this
for
much
describing
of
other
people's
passions
and
feelings
set
her
to
studying
and
speculating
about
her
own,--a
morbid
amusement
in
which
healthy
young
minds
do
not
voluntarily
indulge
wrong-doing
always
brings
its
own
punishment
and
when
jo
most
needed
hers
she
got
it
i
don't
know
whether
the
study
of
shakespeare
helped
her
to
read
character
or
the
natural
instinct
of
a
woman
for
what
was
honest
brave
and
strong
but
while
endowing
her
imaginary
heroes
with
every
perfection
under
the
sun
jo
was
discovering
a
live
hero
who
interested
her
in
spite
of
many
human
imperfections
mr
bhaer
in
one
of
their
conversations
had
advised
her
to
study
simple
true
and
lovely
characters
wherever
she
found
them
as
good
training
for
a
writer
jo
took
him
at
his
word
for
she
coolly
turned
round
and
studied
him,--a
proceeding
which
would
have
much
surprised
him
had
he
known
it
for
the
worthy
professor
was
very
humble
in
his
own
conceit
why
everybody
liked
him
was
what
puzzled
jo
at
first
he
was
neither
rich
nor
great
young
nor
handsome
in
no
respect
what
is
called
fascinating
imposing
or
brilliant
and
yet
he
was
as
attractive
as
a
genial
fire
and
people
seemed
to
gather
about
him
as
naturally
as
about
a
warm
hearth
he
was
poor
yet
always
appeared
to
be
giving
something
away
a
stranger
yet
every
one
was
his
friend
no
longer
young
but
as
happy-hearted
as
a
boy
plain
and
peculiar
yet
his
face
looked
beautiful
to
many
and
his
oddities
were
freely
forgiven
for
his
sake
jo
often
watched
him
trying
to
discover
the
charm
and
at
last
decided
that
it
was
benevolence
which
worked
the
miracle
if
he
had
any
sorrow
it
sat
with
its
head
under
its
wing
and
he
turned
only
his
sunny
side
to
the
world
there
were
lines
upon
his
forehead
but
time
seemed
to
have
touched
him
gently
remembering
how
kind
he
was
to
others
the
pleasant
curves
about
his
mouth
were
the
memorials
of
many
friendly
words
and
cheery
laughs
his
eyes
were
never
cold
or
hard
and
his
big
hand
had
a
warm
strong
grasp
that
was
more
expressive
than
words
his
very
clothes
seemed
to
partake
of
the
hospitable
nature
of
the
wearer
they
looked
as
if
they
were
at
ease
and
liked
to
make
him
comfortable
his
capacious
waistcoat
was
suggestive
of
a
large
heart
underneath
his
rusty
coat
had
a
social
air
and
the
baggy
pockets
plainly
proved
that
little
hands
often
went
in
empty
and
came
out
full
his
very
boots
were
benevolent
and
his
collars
never
stiff
and
raspy
like
other
people's
that's
it
said
jo
to
herself
when
she
at
length
discovered
that
genuine
good-will
towards
one's
fellow-men
could
beautify
and
dignify
even
a
stout
german
teacher
who
shovelled
in
his
dinner
darned
his
own
socks
and
was
burdened
with
the
name
of
bhaer
jo
valued
goodness
highly
but
she
also
possessed
a
most
feminine
respect
for
intellect
and
a
little
discovery
which
she
made
about
the
professor
added
much
to
her
regard
for
him
he
never
spoke
of
himself
and
no
one
ever
knew
that
in
his
native
city
he
had
been
a
man
much
honored
and
esteemed
for
learning
and
integrity
till
a
countryman
came
to
see
him
and
in
a
conversation
with
miss
norton
divulged
the
pleasing
fact
from
her
jo
learned
it
and
liked
it
all
the
better
because
mr
bhaer
had
never
told
it
she
felt
proud
to
know
that
he
was
an
honored
professor
in
berlin
though
only
a
poor
language-master
in
america
and
his
homely
hard-working
life
was
much
beautified
by
the
spice
of
romance
which
this
discovery
gave
it
another
and
a
better
gift
than
intellect
was
shown
her
in
a
most
unexpected
manner
miss
norton
had
the
_entrée_
into
literary
society
which
jo
would
have
had
no
chance
of
seeing
but
for
her
the
solitary
woman
felt
an
interest
in
the
ambitious
girl
and
kindly
conferred
many
favors
of
this
sort
both
on
jo
and
the
professor
she
took
them
with
her
one
night
to
a
select
symposium
held
in
honor
of
several
celebrities
illustration
a
select
symposium
jo
went
prepared
to
bow
down
and
adore
the
mighty
ones
whom
she
had
worshipped
with
youthful
enthusiasm
afar
off
but
her
reverence
for
genius
received
a
severe
shock
that
night
and
it
took
her
some
time
to
recover
from
the
discovery
that
the
great
creatures
were
only
men
and
women
after
all
imagine
her
dismay
on
stealing
a
glance
of
timid
admiration
at
the
poet
whose
lines
suggested
an
ethereal
being
fed
on
spirit
fire
and
dew
to
behold
him
devouring
his
supper
with
an
ardor
which
flushed
his
intellectual
countenance
turning
as
from
a
fallen
idol
she
made
other
discoveries
which
rapidly
dispelled
her
romantic
illusions
the
great
novelist
vibrated
between
two
decanters
with
the
regularity
of
a
pendulum
the
famous
divine
flirted
openly
with
one
of
the
madame
de
staëls
of
the
age
who
looked
daggers
at
another
corinne
who
was
amiably
satirizing
her
after
out-manœuvring
her
in
efforts
to
absorb
the
profound
philosopher
who
imbibed
tea
johnsonianly
and
appeared
to
slumber
the
loquacity
of
the
lady
rendering
speech
impossible
the
scientific
celebrities
forgetting
their
mollusks
and
glacial
periods
gossiped
about
art
while
devoting
themselves
to
oysters
and
ices
with
characteristic
energy
the
young
musician
who
was
charming
the
city
like
a
second
orpheus
talked
horses
and
the
specimen
of
the
british
nobility
present
happened
to
be
the
most
ordinary
man
of
the
party
before
the
evening
was
half
over
jo
felt
so
completely
_désillusionée_
that
she
sat
down
in
a
corner
to
recover
herself
mr
bhaer
soon
joined
her
looking
rather
out
of
his
element
and
presently
several
of
the
philosophers
each
mounted
on
his
hobby
came
ambling
up
to
hold
an
intellectual
tournament
in
the
recess
the
conversation
was
miles
beyond
jo's
comprehension
but
she
enjoyed
it
though
kant
and
hegel
were
unknown
gods
the
subjective
and
objective
unintelligible
terms
and
the
only
thing
evolved
from
her
inner
consciousness
was
a
bad
headache
after
it
was
all
over
it
dawned
upon
her
gradually
that
the
world
was
being
picked
to
pieces
and
put
together
on
new
and
according
to
the
talkers
on
infinitely
better
principles
than
before
that
religion
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
reasoned
into
nothingness
and
intellect
was
to
be
the
only
god
jo
knew
nothing
about
philosophy
or
metaphysics
of
any
sort
but
a
curious
excitement
half
pleasurable
half
painful
came
over
her
as
she
listened
with
a
sense
of
being
turned
adrift
into
time
and
space
like
a
young
balloon
out
on
a
holiday
she
looked
round
to
see
how
the
professor
liked
it
and
found
him
looking
at
her
with
the
grimmest
expression
she
had
ever
seen
him
wear
he
shook
his
head
and
beckoned
her
to
come
away
but
she
was
fascinated
just
then
by
the
freedom
of
speculative
philosophy
and
kept
her
seat
trying
to
find
out
what
the
wise
gentlemen
intended
to
rely
upon
after
they
had
annihilated
all
the
old
beliefs
now
mr
bhaer
was
a
diffident
man
and
slow
to
offer
his
own
opinions
not
because
they
were
unsettled
but
too
sincere
and
earnest
to
be
lightly
spoken
as
he
glanced
from
jo
to
several
other
young
people
attracted
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
philosophic
pyrotechnics
he
knit
his
brows
and
longed
to
speak
fearing
that
some
inflammable
young
soul
would
be
led
astray
by
the
rockets
to
find
when
the
display
was
over
that
they
had
only
an
empty
stick
or
a
scorched
hand
he
bore
it
as
long
as
he
could
but
when
he
was
appealed
to
for
an
opinion
he
blazed
up
with
honest
indignation
and
defended
religion
with
all
the
eloquence
of
truth,--an
eloquence
which
made
his
broken
english
musical
and
his
plain
face
beautiful
he
had
a
hard
fight
for
the
wise
men
argued
well
but
he
didn't
know
when
he
was
beaten
and
stood
to
his
colors
like
a
man
somehow
as
he
talked
the
world
got
right
again
to
jo
the
old
beliefs
that
had
lasted
so
long
seemed
better
than
the
new
god
was
not
a
blind
force
and
immortality
was
not
a
pretty
fable
but
a
blessed
fact
she
felt
as
if
she
had
solid
ground
under
her
feet
again
and
when
mr
bhaer
paused
out-talked
but
not
one
whit
convinced
jo
wanted
to
clap
her
hands
and
thank
him
she
did
neither
but
she
remembered
this
scene
and
gave
the
professor
her
heartiest
respect
for
she
knew
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
speak
out
then
and
there
because
his
conscience
would
not
let
him
be
silent
she
began
to
see
that
character
is
a
better
possession
than
money
rank
intellect
or
beauty
and
to
feel
that
if
greatness
is
what
a
wise
man
has
defined
it
to
be
truth
reverence
and
good-will
then
her
friend
friedrich
bhaer
was
not
only
good
but
great
this
belief
strengthened
daily
she
valued
his
esteem
she
coveted
his
respect
she
wanted
to
be
worthy
of
his
friendship
and
just
when
the
wish
was
sincerest
she
came
near
losing
everything
it
all
grew
out
of
a
cocked
hat
for
one
evening
the
professor
came
in
to
give
jo
her
lesson
with
a
paper
soldier-cap
on
his
head
which
tina
had
put
there
and
he
had
forgotten
to
take
off
it's
evident
he
doesn't
look
in
his
glass
before
coming
down
thought
jo
with
a
smile
as
he
said
goot
efening
and
sat
soberly
down
quite
unconscious
of
the
ludicrous
contrast
between
his
subject
and
his
head-gear
for
he
was
going
to
read
her
the
death
of
wallenstein
illustration
he
doesn't
prink
at
his
glass
before
coming
she
said
nothing
at
first
for
she
liked
to
hear
him
laugh
out
his
big
hearty
laugh
when
anything
funny
happened
so
she
left
him
to
discover
it
for
himself
and
presently
forgot
all
about
it
for
to
hear
a
german
read
schiller
is
rather
an
absorbing
occupation
after
the
reading
came
the
lesson
which
was
a
lively
one
for
jo
was
in
a
gay
mood
that
night
and
the
cocked-hat
kept
her
eyes
dancing
with
merriment
the
professor
didn't
know
what
to
make
of
her
and
stopped
at
last
to
ask
with
an
air
of
mild
surprise
that
was
irresistible,--
mees
marsch
for
what
do
you
laugh
in
your
master's
face
haf
you
no
respect
for
me
that
you
go
on
so
bad
how
can
i
be
respectful
sir
when
you
forget
to
take
your
hat
off
said
jo
lifting
his
hand
to
his
head
the
absent-minded
professor
gravely
felt
and
removed
the
little
cocked-hat
looked
at
it
a
minute
and
then
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
like
a
merry
bass-viol
ah
i
see
him
now
it
is
that
imp
tina
who
makes
me
a
fool
with
my
cap
well
it
is
nothing
but
see
you
if
this
lesson
goes
not
well
you
too
shall
wear
him
but
the
lesson
did
not
go
at
all
for
a
few
minutes
because
mr
bhaer
caught
sight
of
a
picture
on
the
hat
and
unfolding
it
said
with
an
air
of
great
disgust,--
i
wish
these
papers
did
not
come
in
the
house
they
are
not
for
children
to
see
nor
young
people
to
read
it
is
not
well
and
i
haf
no
patience
with
those
who
make
this
harm
jo
glanced
at
the
sheet
and
saw
a
pleasing
illustration
composed
of
a
lunatic
a
corpse
a
villain
and
a
viper
she
did
not
like
it
but
the
impulse
that
made
her
turn
it
over
was
not
one
of
displeasure
but
fear
because
for
a
minute
she
fancied
the
paper
was
the
volcano
it
was
not
however
and
her
panic
subsided
as
she
remembered
that
even
if
it
had
been
and
one
of
her
own
tales
in
it
there
would
have
been
no
name
to
betray
her
she
had
betrayed
herself
however
by
a
look
and
a
blush
for
though
an
absent
man
the
professor
saw
a
good
deal
more
than
people
fancied
he
knew
that
jo
wrote
and
had
met
her
down
among
the
newspaper
offices
more
than
once
but
as
she
never
spoke
of
it
he
asked
no
questions
in
spite
of
a
strong
desire
to
see
her
work
now
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
doing
what
she
was
ashamed
to
own
and
it
troubled
him
he
did
not
say
to
himself
it
is
none
of
my
business
i've
no
right
to
say
anything
as
many
people
would
have
done
he
only
remembered
that
she
was
young
and
poor
a
girl
far
away
from
mother's
love
and
father's
care
and
he
was
moved
to
help
her
with
an
impulse
as
quick
and
natural
as
that
which
would
prompt
him
to
put
out
his
hand
to
save
a
baby
from
a
puddle
all
this
flashed
through
his
mind
in
a
minute
but
not
a
trace
of
it
appeared
in
his
face
and
by
the
time
the
paper
was
turned
and
jo's
needle
threaded
he
was
ready
to
say
quite
naturally
but
very
gravely,--
yes
you
are
right
to
put
it
from
you
i
do
not
like
to
think
that
good
young
girls
should
see
such
things
they
are
made
pleasant
to
some
but
i
would
more
rather
give
my
boys
gunpowder
to
play
with
than
this
bad
trash
all
may
not
be
bad
only
silly
you
know
and
if
there
is
a
demand
for
it
i
don't
see
any
harm
in
supplying
it
many
very
respectable
people
make
an
honest
living
out
of
what
are
called
sensation
stories
said
jo
scratching
gathers
so
energetically
that
a
row
of
little
slits
followed
her
pin
there
is
a
demand
for
whiskey
but
i
think
you
and
i
do
not
care
to
sell
it
if
the
respectable
people
knew
what
harm
they
did
they
would
not
feel
that
the
living
_was_
honest
they
haf
no
right
to
put
poison
in
the
sugar-plum
and
let
the
small
ones
eat
it
no
they
should
think
a
little
and
sweep
mud
in
the
street
before
they
do
this
thing
mr
bhaer
spoke
warmly
and
walked
to
the
fire
crumpling
the
paper
in
his
hands
jo
sat
still
looking
as
if
the
fire
had
come
to
her
for
her
cheeks
burned
long
after
the
cocked
hat
had
turned
to
smoke
and
gone
harmlessly
up
the
chimney
i
should
like
much
to
send
all
the
rest
after
him
muttered
the
professor
coming
back
with
a
relieved
air
jo
thought
what
a
blaze
her
pile
of
papers
upstairs
would
make
and
her
hard-earned
money
lay
rather
heavily
on
her
conscience
at
that
minute
then
she
thought
consolingly
to
herself
mine
are
not
like
that
they
are
only
silly
never
bad
so
i
won't
be
worried
and
taking
up
her
book
she
said
with
a
studious
face,--
shall
we
go
on
sir
i'll
be
very
good
and
proper
now
i
shall
hope
so
was
all
he
said
but
he
meant
more
than
she
imagined
and
the
grave
kind
look
he
gave
her
made
her
feel
as
if
the
words
weekly
volcano
were
printed
in
large
type
on
her
forehead
as
soon
as
she
went
to
her
room
she
got
out
her
papers
and
carefully
re-read
every
one
of
her
stories
being
a
little
short-sighted
mr
bhaer
sometimes
used
eye-glasses
and
jo
had
tried
them
once
smiling
to
see
how
they
magnified
the
fine
print
of
her
book
now
she
seemed
to
have
got
on
the
professor's
mental
or
moral
spectacles
also
for
the
faults
of
these
poor
stories
glared
at
her
dreadfully
and
filled
her
with
dismay
they
_are_
trash
and
will
soon
be
worse
than
trash
if
i
go
on
for
each
is
more
sensational
than
the
last
i've
gone
blindly
on
hurting
myself
and
other
people
for
the
sake
of
money
i
know
it's
so
for
i
can't
read
this
stuff
in
sober
earnest
without
being
horribly
ashamed
of
it
and
what
_should_
i
do
if
they
were
seen
at
home
or
mr
bhaer
got
hold
of
them
jo
turned
hot
at
the
bare
idea
and
stuffed
the
whole
bundle
into
her
stove
nearly
setting
the
chimney
afire
with
the
blaze
illustration
jo
stuffed
the
whole
bundle
into
the
stove
yes
that's
the
best
place
for
such
inflammable
nonsense
i'd
better
burn
the
house
down
i
suppose
than
let
other
people
blow
themselves
up
with
my
gunpowder
she
thought
as
she
watched
the
demon
of
the
jura
whisk
away
a
little
black
cinder
with
fiery
eyes
but
when
nothing
remained
of
all
her
three
months'
work
except
a
heap
of
ashes
and
the
money
in
her
lap
jo
looked
sober
as
she
sat
on
the
floor
wondering
what
she
ought
to
do
about
her
wages
i
think
i
haven't
done
much
harm
_yet_
and
may
keep
this
to
pay
for
my
time
she
said
after
a
long
meditation
adding
impatiently
i
almost
wish
i
hadn't
any
conscience
it's
so
inconvenient
if
i
didn't
care
about
doing
right
and
didn't
feel
uncomfortable
when
doing
wrong
i
should
get
on
capitally
i
can't
help
wishing
sometimes
that
father
and
mother
hadn't
been
so
particular
about
such
things
ah
jo
instead
of
wishing
that
thank
god
that
father
and
mother
_were_
particular
and
pity
from
your
heart
those
who
have
no
such
guardians
to
hedge
them
round
with
principles
which
may
seem
like
prison-walls
to
impatient
youth
but
which
will
prove
sure
foundations
to
build
character
upon
in
womanhood
jo
wrote
no
more
sensational
stories
deciding
that
the
money
did
not
pay
for
her
share
of
the
sensation
but
going
to
the
other
extreme
as
is
the
way
with
people
of
her
stamp
she
took
a
course
of
mrs
sherwood
miss
edgeworth
and
hannah
more
and
then
produced
a
tale
which
might
have
been
more
properly
called
an
essay
or
a
sermon
so
intensely
moral
was
it
she
had
her
doubts
about
it
from
the
beginning
for
her
lively
fancy
and
girlish
romance
felt
as
ill
at
ease
in
the
new
style
as
she
would
have
done
masquerading
in
the
stiff
and
cumbrous
costume
of
the
last
century
she
sent
this
didactic
gem
to
several
markets
but
it
found
no
purchaser
and
she
was
inclined
to
agree
with
mr
dashwood
that
morals
didn't
sell
then
she
tried
a
child's
story
which
she
could
easily
have
disposed
of
if
she
had
not
been
mercenary
enough
to
demand
filthy
lucre
for
it
the
only
person
who
offered
enough
to
make
it
worth
her
while
to
try
juvenile
literature
was
a
worthy
gentleman
who
felt
it
his
mission
to
convert
all
the
world
to
his
particular
belief
but
much
as
she
liked
to
write
for
children
jo
could
not
consent
to
depict
all
her
naughty
boys
as
being
eaten
by
bears
or
tossed
by
mad
bulls
because
they
did
not
go
to
a
particular
sabbath-school
nor
all
the
good
infants
who
did
go
as
rewarded
by
every
kind
of
bliss
from
gilded
gingerbread
to
escorts
of
angels
when
they
departed
this
life
with
psalms
or
sermons
on
their
lisping
tongues
so
nothing
came
of
these
trials
and
jo
corked
up
her
inkstand
and
said
in
a
fit
of
very
wholesome
humility,--
i
don't
know
anything
i'll
wait
till
i
do
before
i
try
again
and
meantime
'sweep
mud
in
the
street,'
if
i
can't
do
better
that's
honest
at
least
which
decision
proved
that
her
second
tumble
down
the
bean-stalk
had
done
her
some
good
while
these
internal
revolutions
were
going
on
her
external
life
had
been
as
busy
and
uneventful
as
usual
and
if
she
sometimes
looked
serious
or
a
little
sad
no
one
observed
it
but
professor
bhaer
he
did
it
so
quietly
that
jo
never
knew
he
was
watching
to
see
if
she
would
accept
and
profit
by
his
reproof
but
she
stood
the
test
and
he
was
satisfied
for
though
no
words
passed
between
them
he
knew
that
she
had
given
up
writing
not
only
did
he
guess
it
by
the
fact
that
the
second
finger
of
her
right
hand
was
no
longer
inky
but
she
spent
her
evenings
downstairs
now
was
met
no
more
among
newspaper
offices
and
studied
with
a
dogged
patience
which
assured
him
that
she
was
bent
on
occupying
her
mind
with
something
useful
if
not
pleasant
he
helped
her
in
many
ways
proving
himself
a
true
friend
and
jo
was
happy
for
while
her
pen
lay
idle
she
was
learning
other
lessons
beside
german
and
laying
a
foundation
for
the
sensation
story
of
her
own
life
it
was
a
pleasant
winter
and
a
long
one
for
she
did
not
leave
mrs
kirke
till
june
every
one
seemed
sorry
when
the
time
came
the
children
were
inconsolable
and
mr
bhaer's
hair
stuck
straight
up
all
over
his
head
for
he
always
rumpled
it
wildly
when
disturbed
in
mind
going
home
ah
you
are
happy
that
you
haf
a
home
to
go
in
he
said
when
she
told
him
and
sat
silently
pulling
his
beard
in
the
corner
while
she
held
a
little
levee
on
that
last
evening
she
was
going
early
so
she
bade
them
all
good-by
over
night
and
when
his
turn
came
she
said
warmly,--
now
sir
you
won't
forget
to
come
and
see
us
if
you
ever
travel
our
way
will
you
i'll
never
forgive
you
if
you
do
for
i
want
them
all
to
know
my
friend
do
you
shall
i
come
he
asked
looking
down
at
her
with
an
eager
expression
which
she
did
not
see
yes
come
next
month
laurie
graduates
then
and
you'd
enjoy
commencement
as
something
new
that
is
your
best
friend
of
whom
you
speak
he
said
in
an
altered
tone
yes
my
boy
teddy
i'm
very
proud
of
him
and
should
like
you
to
see
him
jo
looked
up
then
quite
unconscious
of
anything
but
her
own
pleasure
in
the
prospect
of
showing
them
to
one
another
something
in
mr
bhaer's
face
suddenly
recalled
the
fact
that
she
might
find
laurie
more
than
a
best
friend
and
simply
because
she
particularly
wished
not
to
look
as
if
anything
was
the
matter
she
involuntarily
began
to
blush
and
the
more
she
tried
not
to
the
redder
she
grew
if
it
had
not
been
for
tina
on
her
knee
she
didn't
know
what
would
have
become
of
her
fortunately
the
child
was
moved
to
hug
her
so
she
managed
to
hide
her
face
an
instant
hoping
the
professor
did
not
see
it
but
he
did
and
his
own
changed
again
from
that
momentary
anxiety
to
its
usual
expression
as
he
said
cordially,--
i
fear
i
shall
not
make
the
time
for
that
but
i
wish
the
friend
much
success
and
you
all
happiness
gott
bless
you
and
with
that
he
shook
hands
warmly
shouldered
tina
and
went
away
but
after
the
boys
were
abed
he
sat
long
before
his
fire
with
the
tired
look
on
his
face
and
the
_heimweh_
or
homesickness
lying
heavy
at
his
heart
once
when
he
remembered
jo
as
she
sat
with
the
little
child
in
her
lap
and
that
new
softness
in
her
face
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
a
minute
and
then
roamed
about
the
room
as
if
in
search
of
something
that
he
could
not
find
it
is
not
for
me
i
must
not
hope
it
now
he
said
to
himself
with
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
groan
then
as
if
reproaching
himself
for
the
longing
that
he
could
not
repress
he
went
and
kissed
the
two
towzled
heads
upon
the
pillow
took
down
his
seldom-used
meerschaum
and
opened
his
plato
he
did
his
best
and
did
it
manfully
but
i
don't
think
he
found
that
a
pair
of
rampant
boys
a
pipe
or
even
the
divine
plato
were
very
satisfactory
substitutes
for
wife
and
child
and
home
early
as
it
was
he
was
at
the
station
next
morning
to
see
jo
off
and
thanks
to
him
she
began
her
solitary
journey
with
the
pleasant
memory
of
a
familiar
face
smiling
its
farewell
a
bunch
of
violets
to
keep
her
company
and
best
of
all
the
happy
thought,--
well
the
winter's
gone
and
i've
written
no
books
earned
no
fortune
but
i've
made
a
friend
worth
having
and
i'll
try
to
keep
him
all
my
life
illustration
he
put
the
sisters
into
the
carriage
xxxv
heartache
whatever
his
motive
might
have
been
laurie
studied
to
some
purpose
that
year
for
he
graduated
with
honor
and
gave
the
latin
oration
with
the
grace
of
a
phillips
and
the
eloquence
of
a
demosthenes
so
his
friends
said
they
were
all
there
his
grandfather,--oh
so
proud!--mr
and
mrs
march
john
and
meg
jo
and
beth
and
all
exulted
over
him
with
the
sincere
admiration
which
boys
make
light
of
at
the
time
but
fail
to
win
from
the
world
by
any
after-triumphs
i've
got
to
stay
for
this
confounded
supper
but
i
shall
be
home
early
to-morrow
you'll
come
and
meet
me
as
usual
girls
laurie
said
as
he
put
the
sisters
into
the
carriage
after
the
joys
of
the
day
were
over
he
said
girls
but
he
meant
jo
for
she
was
the
only
one
who
kept
up
the
old
custom
she
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
her
splendid
successful
boy
anything
and
answered
warmly,--
i'll
come
teddy
rain
or
shine
and
march
before
you
playing
'_hail
the
conquering
hero
comes_,'
on
a
jews-harp
laurie
thanked
her
with
a
look
that
made
her
think
in
a
sudden
panic
oh
deary
me
i
know
he'll
say
something
and
then
what
shall
i
do
evening
meditation
and
morning
work
somewhat
allayed
her
fears
and
having
decided
that
she
wouldn't
be
vain
enough
to
think
people
were
going
to
propose
when
she
had
given
them
every
reason
to
know
what
her
answer
would
be
she
set
forth
at
the
appointed
time
hoping
teddy
wouldn't
do
anything
to
make
her
hurt
his
poor
little
feelings
a
call
at
meg's
and
a
refreshing
sniff
and
sip
at
the
daisy
and
demijohn
still
further
fortified
her
for
the
_tête-à-tête_
but
when
she
saw
a
stalwart
figure
looming
in
the
distance
she
had
a
strong
desire
to
turn
about
and
run
away
where's
the
jews-harp
jo
cried
laurie
as
soon
as
he
was
within
speaking
distance
i
forgot
it
and
jo
took
heart
again
for
that
salutation
could
not
be
called
lover-like
she
always
used
to
take
his
arm
on
these
occasions
now
she
did
not
and
he
made
no
complaint
which
was
a
bad
sign
but
talked
on
rapidly
about
all
sorts
of
far-away
subjects
till
they
turned
from
the
road
into
the
little
path
that
led
homeward
through
the
grove
then
he
walked
more
slowly
suddenly
lost
his
fine
flow
of
language
and
now
and
then
a
dreadful
pause
occurred
to
rescue
the
conversation
from
one
of
the
wells
of
silence
into
which
it
kept
falling
jo
said
hastily,--
now
you
must
have
a
good
long
holiday
i
intend
to
something
in
his
resolute
tone
made
jo
look
up
quickly
to
find
him
looking
down
at
her
with
an
expression
that
assured
her
the
dreaded
moment
had
come
and
made
her
put
out
her
hand
with
an
imploring,--
no
teddy
please
don't
i
will
and
you
_must_
hear
me
it's
no
use
jo
we've
got
to
have
it
out
and
the
sooner
the
better
for
both
of
us
he
answered
getting
flushed
and
excited
all
at
once
say
what
you
like
then
i'll
listen
said
jo
with
a
desperate
sort
of
patience
laurie
was
a
young
lover
but
he
was
in
earnest
and
meant
to
have
it
out
if
he
died
in
the
attempt
so
he
plunged
into
the
subject
with
characteristic
impetuosity
saying
in
a
voice
that
_would_
get
choky
now
and
then
in
spite
of
manful
efforts
to
keep
it
steady,--
i've
loved
you
ever
since
i've
known
you
jo
couldn't
help
it
you've
been
so
good
to
me
i've
tried
to
show
it
but
you
wouldn't
let
me
now
i'm
going
to
make
you
hear
and
give
me
an
answer
for
i
_can't_
go
on
so
any
longer
i
wanted
to
save
you
this
i
thought
you'd
understand--
began
jo
finding
it
a
great
deal
harder
than
she
expected
i
know
you
did
but
girls
are
so
queer
you
never
know
what
they
mean
they
say
no
when
they
mean
yes
and
drive
a
man
out
of
his
wits
just
for
the
fun
of
it
returned
laurie
entrenching
himself
behind
an
undeniable
fact
_i_
don't
i
never
wanted
to
make
you
care
for
me
so
and
i
went
away
to
keep
you
from
it
if
i
could
i
thought
so
it
was
like
you
but
it
was
no
use
i
only
loved
you
all
the
more
and
i
worked
hard
to
please
you
and
i
gave
up
billiards
and
everything
you
didn't
like
and
waited
and
never
complained
for
i
hoped
you'd
love
me
though
i'm
not
half
good
enough--
here
there
was
a
choke
that
couldn't
be
controlled
so
he
decapitated
buttercups
while
he
cleared
his
confounded
throat
yes
you
are
you're
a
great
deal
too
good
for
me
and
i'm
so
grateful
to
you
and
so
proud
and
fond
of
you
i
don't
see
why
i
can't
love
you
as
you
want
me
to
i've
tried
but
i
can't
change
the
feeling
and
it
would
be
a
lie
to
say
i
do
when
i
don't
really
truly
jo
he
stopped
short
and
caught
both
her
hands
as
he
put
his
question
with
a
look
that
she
did
not
soon
forget
really
truly
dear
they
were
in
the
grove
now
close
by
the
stile
and
when
the
last
words
fell
reluctantly
from
jo's
lips
laurie
dropped
her
hands
and
turned
as
if
to
go
on
but
for
once
in
his
life
that
fence
was
too
much
for
him
so
he
just
laid
his
head
down
on
the
mossy
post
and
stood
so
still
that
jo
was
frightened
illustration
he
laid
his
head
down
on
the
mossy
post
o
teddy
i'm
so
sorry
so
desperately
sorry
i
could
kill
myself
if
it
would
do
any
good
i
wish
you
wouldn't
take
it
so
hard
i
can't
help
it
you
know
it's
impossible
for
people
to
make
themselves
love
other
people
if
they
don't
cried
jo
inelegantly
but
remorsefully
as
she
softly
patted
his
shoulder
remembering
the
time
when
he
had
comforted
her
so
long
ago
they
do
sometimes
said
a
muffled
voice
from
the
post
i
don't
believe
it's
the
right
sort
of
love
and
i'd
rather
not
try
it
was
the
decided
answer
there
was
a
long
pause
while
a
blackbird
sung
blithely
on
the
willow
by
the
river
and
the
tall
grass
rustled
in
the
wind
presently
jo
said
very
soberly
as
she
sat
down
on
the
step
of
the
stile,--
laurie
i
want
to
tell
you
something
he
started
as
if
he
had
been
shot
threw
up
his
head
and
cried
out
in
a
fierce
tone--
_don't_
tell
me
that
jo
i
can't
bear
it
now
tell
what
she
asked
wondering
at
his
violence
that
you
love
that
old
man
what
old
man
demanded
jo
thinking
he
must
mean
his
grandfather
that
devilish
professor
you
were
always
writing
about
if
you
say
you
love
him
i
know
i
shall
do
something
desperate
and
he
looked
as
if
he
would
keep
his
word
as
he
clenched
his
hands
with
a
wrathful
spark
in
his
eyes
jo
wanted
to
laugh
but
restrained
herself
and
said
warmly
for
she
too
was
getting
excited
with
all
this,--
don't
swear
teddy
he
isn't
old
nor
anything
bad
but
good
and
kind
and
the
best
friend
i've
got
next
to
you
pray
don't
fly
into
a
passion
i
want
to
be
kind
but
i
know
i
shall
get
angry
if
you
abuse
my
professor
i
haven't
the
least
idea
of
loving
him
or
anybody
else
but
you
will
after
a
while
and
then
what
will
become
of
me
you'll
love
some
one
else
too
like
a
sensible
boy
and
forget
all
this
trouble
i
_can't_
love
any
one
else
and
i'll
never
forget
you
jo
never
never
with
a
stamp
to
emphasize
his
passionate
words
what
_shall_
i
do
with
him
sighed
jo
finding
that
emotions
were
more
unmanageable
than
she
expected
you
haven't
heard
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
sit
down
and
listen
for
indeed
i
want
to
do
right
and
make
you
happy
she
said
hoping
to
soothe
him
with
a
little
reason
which
proved
that
she
knew
nothing
about
love
seeing
a
ray
of
hope
in
that
last
speech
laurie
threw
himself
down
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
leaned
his
arm
on
the
lower
step
of
the
stile
and
looked
up
at
her
with
an
expectant
face
now
that
arrangement
was
not
conducive
to
calm
speech
or
clear
thought
on
jo's
part
for
how
_could_
she
say
hard
things
to
her
boy
while
he
watched
her
with
eyes
full
of
love
and
longing
and
lashes
still
wet
with
the
bitter
drop
or
two
her
hardness
of
heart
had
wrung
from
him
she
gently
turned
his
head
away
saying
as
she
stroked
the
wavy
hair
which
had
been
allowed
to
grow
for
her
sake,--how
touching
that
was
to
be
sure!--
i
agree
with
mother
that
you
and
i
are
not
suited
to
each
other
because
our
quick
tempers
and
strong
wills
would
probably
make
us
very
miserable
if
we
were
so
foolish
as
to--
jo
paused
a
little
over
the
last
word
but
laurie
uttered
it
with
a
rapturous
expression,--
marry,--no
we
shouldn't
if
you
loved
me
jo
i
should
be
a
perfect
saint
for
you
could
make
me
anything
you
like
no
i
can't
i've
tried
it
and
failed
and
i
won't
risk
our
happiness
by
such
a
serious
experiment
we
don't
agree
and
we
never
shall
so
we'll
be
good
friends
all
our
lives
but
we
won't
go
and
do
anything
rash
yes
we
will
if
we
get
the
chance
muttered
laurie
rebelliously
now
do
be
reasonable
and
take
a
sensible
view
of
the
case
implored
jo
almost
at
her
wit's
end
i
won't
be
reasonable
i
don't
want
to
take
what
you
call
'a
sensible
view;'
it
won't
help
me
and
it
only
makes
you
harder
i
don't
believe
you've
got
any
heart
i
wish
i
hadn't
there
was
a
little
quiver
in
jo's
voice
and
thinking
it
a
good
omen
laurie
turned
round
bringing
all
his
persuasive
powers
to
bear
as
he
said
in
the
wheedlesome
tone
that
had
never
been
so
dangerously
wheedlesome
before,--
don't
disappoint
us
dear
every
one
expects
it
grandpa
has
set
his
heart
upon
it
your
people
like
it
and
i
can't
get
on
without
you
say
you
will
and
let's
be
happy
do
do
not
until
months
afterward
did
jo
understand
how
she
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
hold
fast
to
the
resolution
she
had
made
when
she
decided
that
she
did
not
love
her
boy
and
never
could
it
was
very
hard
to
do
but
she
did
it
knowing
that
delay
was
both
useless
and
cruel
i
can't
say
'yes'
truly
so
i
won't
say
it
at
all
you'll
see
that
i'm
right
by
and
by
and
thank
me
for
it"--she
began
solemnly
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
do
and
laurie
bounced
up
off
the
grass
burning
with
indignation
at
the
bare
idea
yes
you
will
persisted
jo
you'll
get
over
this
after
a
while
and
find
some
lovely
accomplished
girl
who
will
adore
you
and
make
a
fine
mistress
for
your
fine
house
i
shouldn't
i'm
homely
and
awkward
and
odd
and
old
and
you'd
be
ashamed
of
me
and
we
should
quarrel,--we
can't
help
it
even
now
you
see,--and
i
shouldn't
like
elegant
society
and
you
would
and
you'd
hate
my
scribbling
and
i
couldn't
get
on
without
it
and
we
should
be
unhappy
and
wish
we
hadn't
done
it
and
everything
would
be
horrid
anything
more
asked
laurie
finding
it
hard
to
listen
patiently
to
this
prophetic
burst
nothing
more
except
that
i
don't
believe
i
shall
ever
marry
i'm
happy
as
i
am
and
love
my
liberty
too
well
to
be
in
any
hurry
to
give
it
up
for
any
mortal
man
i
know
better
broke
in
laurie
you
think
so
now
but
there'll
come
a
time
when
you
_will_
care
for
somebody
and
you'll
love
him
tremendously
and
live
and
die
for
him
i
know
you
will
it's
your
way
and
i
shall
have
to
stand
by
and
see
it
and
the
despairing
lover
cast
his
hat
upon
the
ground
with
a
gesture
that
would
have
seemed
comical
if
his
face
had
not
been
so
tragical
yes
i
_will_
live
and
die
for
him
if
he
ever
comes
and
makes
me
love
him
in
spite
of
myself
and
you
must
do
the
best
you
can
cried
jo
losing
patience
with
poor
teddy
i've
done
my
best
but
you
_won't_
be
reasonable
and
it's
selfish
of
you
to
keep
teasing
for
what
i
can't
give
i
shall
always
be
fond
of
you
very
fond
indeed
as
a
friend
but
i'll
never
marry
you
and
the
sooner
you
believe
it
the
better
for
both
of
us,--so
now
that
speech
was
like
fire
to
gunpowder
laurie
looked
at
her
a
minute
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
himself
then
turned
sharply
away
saying
in
a
desperate
sort
of
tone,--
you'll
be
sorry
some
day
jo
oh
where
are
you
going
she
cried
for
his
face
frightened
her
to
the
devil
was
the
consoling
answer
for
a
minute
jo's
heart
stood
still
as
he
swung
himself
down
the
bank
toward
the
river
but
it
takes
much
folly
sin
or
misery
to
send
a
young
man
to
a
violent
death
and
laurie
was
not
one
of
the
weak
sort
who
are
conquered
by
a
single
failure
he
had
no
thought
of
a
melodramatic
plunge
but
some
blind
instinct
led
him
to
fling
hat
and
coat
into
his
boat
and
row
away
with
all
his
might
making
better
time
up
the
river
than
he
had
done
in
many
a
race
jo
drew
a
long
breath
and
unclasped
her
hands
as
she
watched
the
poor
fellow
trying
to
outstrip
the
trouble
which
he
carried
in
his
heart
that
will
do
him
good
and
he'll
come
home
in
such
a
tender
penitent
state
of
mind
that
i
sha'n't
dare
to
see
him
she
said
adding
as
she
went
slowly
home
feeling
as
if
she
had
murdered
some
innocent
thing
and
buried
it
under
the
leaves,--
now
i
must
go
and
prepare
mr
laurence
to
be
very
kind
to
my
poor
boy
i
wish
he'd
love
beth
perhaps
he
may
in
time
but
i
begin
to
think
i
was
mistaken
about
her
oh
dear
how
can
girls
like
to
have
lovers
and
refuse
them
i
think
it's
dreadful
being
sure
that
no
one
could
do
it
so
well
as
herself
she
went
straight
to
mr
laurence
told
the
hard
story
bravely
through
and
then
broke
down
crying
so
dismally
over
her
own
insensibility
that
the
kind
old
gentleman
though
sorely
disappointed
did
not
utter
a
reproach
he
found
it
difficult
to
understand
how
any
girl
could
help
loving
laurie
and
hoped
she
would
change
her
mind
but
he
knew
even
better
than
jo
that
love
cannot
be
forced
so
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
resolved
to
carry
his
boy
out
of
harm's
way
for
young
impetuosity's
parting
words
to
jo
disturbed
him
more
than
he
would
confess
when
laurie
came
home
dead
tired
but
quite
composed
his
grandfather
met
him
as
if
he
knew
nothing
and
kept
up
the
delusion
very
successfully
for
an
hour
or
two
but
when
they
sat
together
in
the
twilight
the
time
they
used
to
enjoy
so
much
it
was
hard
work
for
the
old
man
to
ramble
on
as
usual
and
harder
still
for
the
young
one
to
listen
to
praises
of
the
last
year's
success
which
to
him
now
seemed
love's
labor
lost
he
bore
it
as
long
as
he
could
then
went
to
his
piano
and
began
to
play
the
windows
were
open
and
jo
walking
in
the
garden
with
beth
for
once
understood
music
better
than
her
sister
for
he
played
the
sonata
pathétique
and
played
it
as
he
never
did
before
that's
very
fine
i
dare
say
but
it's
sad
enough
to
make
one
cry
give
us
something
gayer
lad
said
mr
laurence
whose
kind
old
heart
was
full
of
sympathy
which
he
longed
to
show
but
knew
not
how
laurie
dashed
into
a
livelier
strain
played
stormily
for
several
minutes
and
would
have
got
through
bravely
if
in
a
momentary
lull
mrs
march's
voice
had
not
been
heard
calling,--
jo
dear
come
in
i
want
you
just
what
laurie
longed
to
say
with
a
different
meaning
as
he
listened
he
lost
his
place
the
music
ended
with
a
broken
chord
and
the
musician
sat
silent
in
the
dark
i
can't
stand
this
muttered
the
old
gentleman
up
he
got
groped
his
way
to
the
piano
laid
a
kind
hand
on
either
of
the
broad
shoulders
and
said
as
gently
as
a
woman,--
i
know
my
boy
i
know
no
answer
for
an
instant
then
laurie
asked
sharply,--
who
told
you
jo
herself
then
there's
an
end
of
it
and
he
shook
off
his
grandfather's
hands
with
an
impatient
motion
for
though
grateful
for
the
sympathy
his
man's
pride
could
not
bear
a
man's
pity
not
quite
i
want
to
say
one
thing
and
then
there
shall
be
an
end
of
it
returned
mr
laurence
with
unusual
mildness
you
won't
care
to
stay
at
home
just
now
perhaps
i
don't
intend
to
run
away
from
a
girl
jo
can't
prevent
my
seeing
her
and
i
shall
stay
and
do
it
as
long
as
i
like
interrupted
laurie
in
a
defiant
tone
not
if
you
are
the
gentleman
i
think
you
i'm
disappointed
but
the
girl
can't
help
it
and
the
only
thing
left
for
you
to
do
is
to
go
away
for
a
time
where
will
you
go
anywhere
i
don't
care
what
becomes
of
me
and
laurie
got
up
with
a
reckless
laugh
that
grated
on
his
grandfather's
ear
take
it
like
a
man
and
don't
do
anything
rash
for
god's
sake
why
not
go
abroad
as
you
planned
and
forget
it
i
can't
but
you've
been
wild
to
go
and
i
promised
you
should
when
you
got
through
college
ah
but
i
didn't
mean
to
go
alone
and
laurie
walked
fast
through
the
room
with
an
expression
which
it
was
well
his
grandfather
did
not
see
i
don't
ask
you
to
go
alone
there's
some
one
ready
and
glad
to
go
with
you
anywhere
in
the
world
who
sir
stopping
to
listen
myself
laurie
came
back
as
quickly
as
he
went
and
put
out
his
hand
saying
huskily,--
i'm
a
selfish
brute
but--you
know--grandfather--
lord
help
me
yes
i
do
know
for
i've
been
through
it
all
before
once
in
my
own
young
days
and
then
with
your
father
now
my
dear
boy
just
sit
quietly
down
and
hear
my
plan
it's
all
settled
and
can
be
carried
out
at
once
said
mr
laurence
keeping
hold
of
the
young
man
as
if
fearful
that
he
would
break
away
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
well
sir
what
is
it
and
laurie
sat
down
without
a
sign
of
interest
in
face
or
voice
there
is
business
in
london
that
needs
looking
after
i
meant
you
should
attend
to
it
but
i
can
do
it
better
myself
and
things
here
will
get
on
very
well
with
brooke
to
manage
them
my
partners
do
almost
everything
i'm
merely
holding
on
till
you
take
my
place
and
can
be
off
at
any
time
but
you
hate
travelling
sir
i
can't
ask
it
of
you
at
your
age
began
laurie
who
was
grateful
for
the
sacrifice
but
much
preferred
to
go
alone
if
he
went
at
all
the
old
gentleman
knew
that
perfectly
well
and
particularly
desired
to
prevent
it
for
the
mood
in
which
he
found
his
grandson
assured
him
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
leave
him
to
his
own
devices
so
stifling
a
natural
regret
at
the
thought
of
the
home
comforts
he
would
leave
behind
him
he
said
stoutly,--
bless
your
soul
i'm
not
superannuated
yet
i
quite
enjoy
the
idea
it
will
do
me
good
and
my
old
bones
won't
suffer
for
travelling
nowadays
is
almost
as
easy
as
sitting
in
a
chair
a
restless
movement
from
laurie
suggested
that
_his_
chair
was
not
easy
or
that
he
did
not
like
the
plan
and
made
the
old
man
add
hastily,--
i
don't
mean
to
be
a
marplot
or
a
burden
i
go
because
i
think
you'd
feel
happier
than
if
i
was
left
behind
i
don't
intend
to
gad
about
with
you
but
leave
you
free
to
go
where
you
like
while
i
amuse
myself
in
my
own
way
i've
friends
in
london
and
paris
and
should
like
to
visit
them
meantime
you
can
go
to
italy
germany
switzerland
where
you
will
and
enjoy
pictures
music
scenery
and
adventures
to
your
heart's
content
now
laurie
felt
just
then
that
his
heart
was
entirely
broken
and
the
world
a
howling
wilderness
but
at
the
sound
of
certain
words
which
the
old
gentleman
artfully
introduced
into
his
closing
sentence
the
broken
heart
gave
an
unexpected
leap
and
a
green
oasis
or
two
suddenly
appeared
in
the
howling
wilderness
he
sighed
and
then
said
in
a
spiritless
tone,--
just
as
you
like
sir
it
doesn't
matter
where
i
go
or
what
i
do
it
does
to
me
remember
that
my
lad
i
give
you
entire
liberty
but
i
trust
you
to
make
an
honest
use
of
it
promise
me
that
laurie
anything
you
like
sir
good
thought
the
old
gentleman
you
don't
care
now
but
there'll
come
a
time
when
that
promise
will
keep
you
out
of
mischief
or
i'm
much
mistaken
being
an
energetic
individual
mr
laurence
struck
while
the
iron
was
hot
and
before
the
blighted
being
recovered
spirit
enough
to
rebel
they
were
off
during
the
time
necessary
for
preparation
laurie
bore
himself
as
young
gentlemen
usually
do
in
such
cases
he
was
moody
irritable
and
pensive
by
turns
lost
his
appetite
neglected
his
dress
and
devoted
much
time
to
playing
tempestuously
on
his
piano
avoided
jo
but
consoled
himself
by
staring
at
her
from
his
window
with
a
tragical
face
that
haunted
her
dreams
by
night
and
oppressed
her
with
a
heavy
sense
of
guilt
by
day
unlike
some
sufferers
he
never
spoke
of
his
unrequited
passion
and
would
allow
no
one
not
even
mrs
march
to
attempt
consolation
or
offer
sympathy
on
some
accounts
this
was
a
relief
to
his
friends
but
the
weeks
before
his
departure
were
very
uncomfortable
and
every
one
rejoiced
that
the
poor
dear
fellow
was
going
away
to
forget
his
trouble
and
come
home
happy
of
course
he
smiled
darkly
at
their
delusion
but
passed
it
by
with
the
sad
superiority
of
one
who
knew
that
his
fidelity
like
his
love
was
unalterable
when
the
parting
came
he
affected
high
spirits
to
conceal
certain
inconvenient
emotions
which
seemed
inclined
to
assert
themselves
this
gayety
did
not
impose
upon
anybody
but
they
tried
to
look
as
if
it
did
for
his
sake
and
he
got
on
very
well
till
mrs
march
kissed
him
with
a
whisper
full
of
motherly
solicitude
then
feeling
that
he
was
going
very
fast
he
hastily
embraced
them
all
round
not
forgetting
the
afflicted
hannah
and
ran
downstairs
as
if
for
his
life
jo
followed
a
minute
after
to
wave
her
hand
to
him
if
he
looked
round
he
did
look
round
came
back
put
his
arms
about
her
as
she
stood
on
the
step
above
him
and
looked
up
at
her
with
a
face
that
made
his
short
appeal
both
eloquent
and
pathetic
o
jo
can't
you
illustration
o
jo
can't
you
teddy
dear
i
wish
i
could
that
was
all
except
a
little
pause
then
laurie
straightened
himself
up
said
it's
all
right
never
mind
and
went
away
without
another
word
ah
but
it
wasn't
all
right
and
jo
_did_
mind
for
while
the
curly
head
lay
on
her
arm
a
minute
after
her
hard
answer
she
felt
as
if
she
had
stabbed
her
dearest
friend
and
when
he
left
her
without
a
look
behind
him
she
knew
that
the
boy
laurie
never
would
come
again
illustration
tail-piece
xxxvi
beth's
secret
when
jo
came
home
that
spring
she
had
been
struck
with
the
change
in
beth
no
one
spoke
of
it
or
seemed
aware
of
it
for
it
had
come
too
gradually
to
startle
those
who
saw
her
daily
but
to
eyes
sharpened
by
absence
it
was
very
plain
and
a
heavy
weight
fell
on
jo's
heart
as
she
saw
her
sister's
face
it
was
no
paler
and
but
little
thinner
than
in
the
autumn
yet
there
was
a
strange
transparent
look
about
it
as
if
the
mortal
was
being
slowly
refined
away
and
the
immortal
shining
through
the
frail
flesh
with
an
indescribably
pathetic
beauty
jo
saw
and
felt
it
but
said
nothing
at
the
time
and
soon
the
first
impression
lost
much
of
its
power
for
beth
seemed
happy
no
one
appeared
to
doubt
that
she
was
better
and
presently
in
other
cares
jo
for
a
time
forgot
her
fear
but
when
laurie
was
gone
and
peace
prevailed
again
the
vague
anxiety
returned
and
haunted
her
she
had
confessed
her
sins
and
been
forgiven
but
when
she
showed
her
savings
and
proposed
the
mountain
trip
beth
had
thanked
her
heartily
but
begged
not
to
go
so
far
away
from
home
another
little
visit
to
the
seashore
would
suit
her
better
and
as
grandma
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
leave
the
babies
jo
took
beth
down
to
the
quiet
place
where
she
could
live
much
in
the
open
air
and
let
the
fresh
sea-breezes
blow
a
little
color
into
her
pale
cheeks
it
was
not
a
fashionable
place
but
even
among
the
pleasant
people
there
the
girls
made
few
friends
preferring
to
live
for
one
another
beth
was
too
shy
to
enjoy
society
and
jo
too
wrapped
up
in
her
to
care
for
any
one
else
so
they
were
all
in
all
to
each
other
and
came
and
went
quite
unconscious
of
the
interest
they
excited
in
those
about
them
who
watched
with
sympathetic
eyes
the
strong
sister
and
the
feeble
one
always
together
as
if
they
felt
instinctively
that
a
long
separation
was
not
far
away
they
did
feel
it
yet
neither
spoke
of
it
for
often
between
ourselves
and
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
us
there
exists
a
reserve
which
it
is
very
hard
to
overcome
jo
felt
as
if
a
veil
had
fallen
between
her
heart
and
beth's
but
when
she
put
out
her
hand
to
lift
it
up
there
seemed
something
sacred
in
the
silence
and
she
waited
for
beth
to
speak
she
wondered
and
was
thankful
also
that
her
parents
did
not
seem
to
see
what
she
saw
and
during
the
quiet
weeks
when
the
shadow
grew
so
plain
to
her
she
said
nothing
of
it
to
those
at
home
believing
that
it
would
tell
itself
when
beth
came
back
no
better
she
wondered
still
more
if
her
sister
really
guessed
the
hard
truth
and
what
thoughts
were
passing
through
her
mind
during
the
long
hours
when
she
lay
on
the
warm
rocks
with
her
head
in
jo's
lap
while
the
winds
blew
healthfully
over
her
and
the
sea
made
music
at
her
feet
illustration
with
her
head
in
jo's
lap
while
the
wind
blew
healthfully
over
her
one
day
beth
told
her
jo
thought
she
was
asleep
she
lay
so
still
and
putting
down
her
book
sat
looking
at
her
with
wistful
eyes
trying
to
see
signs
of
hope
in
the
faint
color
on
beth's
cheeks
but
she
could
not
find
enough
to
satisfy
her
for
the
cheeks
were
very
thin
and
the
hands
seemed
too
feeble
to
hold
even
the
rosy
little
shells
they
had
been
gathering
it
came
to
her
then
more
bitterly
than
ever
that
beth
was
slowly
drifting
away
from
her
and
her
arms
instinctively
tightened
their
hold
upon
the
dearest
treasure
she
possessed
for
a
minute
her
eyes
were
too
dim
for
seeing
and
when
they
cleared
beth
was
looking
up
at
her
so
tenderly
that
there
was
hardly
any
need
for
her
to
say,--
jo
dear
i'm
glad
you
know
it
i've
tried
to
tell
you
but
i
couldn't
there
was
no
answer
except
her
sister's
cheek
against
her
own
not
even
tears
for
when
most
deeply
moved
jo
did
not
cry
she
was
the
weaker
then
and
beth
tried
to
comfort
and
sustain
her
with
her
arms
about
her
and
the
soothing
words
she
whispered
in
her
ear
i've
known
it
for
a
good
while
dear
and
now
i'm
used
to
it
it
isn't
hard
to
think
of
or
to
bear
try
to
see
it
so
and
don't
be
troubled
about
me
because
it's
best
indeed
it
is
is
this
what
made
you
so
unhappy
in
the
autumn
beth
you
did
not
feel
it
then
and
keep
it
to
yourself
so
long
did
you
asked
jo
refusing
to
see
or
say
that
it
_was_
best
but
glad
to
know
that
laurie
had
no
part
in
beth's
trouble
yes
i
gave
up
hoping
then
but
i
didn't
like
to
own
it
i
tried
to
think
it
was
a
sick
fancy
and
would
not
let
it
trouble
any
one
but
when
i
saw
you
all
so
well
and
strong
and
full
of
happy
plans
it
was
hard
to
feel
that
i
could
never
be
like
you
and
then
i
was
miserable
jo
o
beth
and
you
didn't
tell
me
didn't
let
me
comfort
and
help
you
how
could
you
shut
me
out
and
bear
it
all
alone
jo's
voice
was
full
of
tender
reproach
and
her
heart
ached
to
think
of
the
solitary
struggle
that
must
have
gone
on
while
beth
learned
to
say
good-by
to
health
love
and
life
and
take
up
her
cross
so
cheerfully
perhaps
it
was
wrong
but
i
tried
to
do
right
i
wasn't
sure
no
one
said
anything
and
i
hoped
i
was
mistaken
it
would
have
been
selfish
to
frighten
you
all
when
marmee
was
so
anxious
about
meg
and
amy
away
and
you
so
happy
with
laurie,--at
least
i
thought
so
then
and
i
thought
that
you
loved
him
beth
and
i
went
away
because
i
couldn't
cried
jo
glad
to
say
all
the
truth
beth
looked
so
amazed
at
the
idea
that
jo
smiled
in
spite
of
her
pain
and
added
softly,--
then
you
didn't
deary
i
was
afraid
it
was
so
and
imagined
your
poor
little
heart
full
of
love-lornity
all
that
while
why
jo
how
could
i
when
he
was
so
fond
of
you
asked
beth
as
innocently
as
a
child
i
do
love
him
dearly
he
is
so
good
to
me
how
can
i
help
it
but
he
never
could
be
anything
to
me
but
my
brother
i
hope
he
truly
will
be
sometime
not
through
me
said
jo
decidedly
amy
is
left
for
him
and
they
would
suit
excellently
but
i
have
no
heart
for
such
things
now
i
don't
care
what
becomes
of
anybody
but
you
beth
you
_must_
get
well
i
want
to
oh
so
much
i
try
but
every
day
i
lose
a
little
and
feel
more
sure
that
i
shall
never
gain
it
back
it's
like
the
tide
jo
when
it
turns
it
goes
slowly
but
it
can't
be
stopped
it
_shall_
be
stopped
your
tide
must
not
turn
so
soon
nineteen
is
too
young
beth
i
can't
let
you
go
i'll
work
and
pray
and
fight
against
it
i'll
keep
you
in
spite
of
everything
there
must
be
ways
it
can't
be
too
late
god
won't
be
so
cruel
as
to
take
you
from
me
cried
poor
jo
rebelliously
for
her
spirit
was
far
less
piously
submissive
than
beth's
simple
sincere
people
seldom
speak
much
of
their
piety
it
shows
itself
in
acts
rather
than
in
words
and
has
more
influence
than
homilies
or
protestations
beth
could
not
reason
upon
or
explain
the
faith
that
gave
her
courage
and
patience
to
give
up
life
and
cheerfully
wait
for
death
like
a
confiding
child
she
asked
no
questions
but
left
everything
to
god
and
nature
father
and
mother
of
us
all
feeling
sure
that
they
and
they
only
could
teach
and
strengthen
heart
and
spirit
for
this
life
and
the
life
to
come
she
did
not
rebuke
jo
with
saintly
speeches
only
loved
her
better
for
her
passionate
affection
and
clung
more
closely
to
the
dear
human
love
from
which
our
father
never
means
us
to
be
weaned
but
through
which
he
draws
us
closer
to
himself
she
could
not
say
i'm
glad
to
go
for
life
was
very
sweet
to
her
she
could
only
sob
out
i
try
to
be
willing
while
she
held
fast
to
jo
as
the
first
bitter
wave
of
this
great
sorrow
broke
over
them
together
by
and
by
beth
said
with
recovered
serenity,--
you'll
tell
them
this
when
we
go
home
i
think
they
will
see
it
without
words
sighed
jo
for
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
beth
changed
every
day
perhaps
not
i've
heard
that
the
people
who
love
best
are
often
blindest
to
such
things
if
they
don't
see
it
you
will
tell
them
for
me
i
don't
want
any
secrets
and
it's
kinder
to
prepare
them
meg
has
john
and
the
babies
to
comfort
her
but
you
must
stand
by
father
and
mother
won't
you
jo
if
i
can
but
beth
i
don't
give
up
yet
i'm
going
to
believe
that
it
_is_
a
sick
fancy
and
not
let
you
think
it's
true
said
jo
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
beth
lay
a
minute
thinking
and
then
said
in
her
quiet
way,--
i
don't
know
how
to
express
myself
and
shouldn't
try
to
any
one
but
you
because
i
can't
speak
out
except
to
my
jo
i
only
mean
to
say
that
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
never
was
intended
i
should
live
long
i'm
not
like
the
rest
of
you
i
never
made
any
plans
about
what
i'd
do
when
i
grew
up
i
never
thought
of
being
married
as
you
all
did
i
couldn't
seem
to
imagine
myself
anything
but
stupid
little
beth
trotting
about
at
home
of
no
use
anywhere
but
there
i
never
wanted
to
go
away
and
the
hard
part
now
is
the
leaving
you
all
i'm
not
afraid
but
it
seems
as
if
i
should
be
homesick
for
you
even
in
heaven
jo
could
not
speak
and
for
several
minutes
there
was
no
sound
but
the
sigh
of
the
wind
and
the
lapping
of
the
tide
a
white-winged
gull
flew
by
with
the
flash
of
sunshine
on
its
silvery
breast
beth
watched
it
till
it
vanished
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
sadness
a
little
gray-coated
sand-bird
came
tripping
over
the
beach
peeping
softly
to
itself
as
if
enjoying
the
sun
and
sea
it
came
quite
close
to
beth
looked
at
her
with
a
friendly
eye
and
sat
upon
a
warm
stone
dressing
its
wet
feathers
quite
at
home
beth
smiled
and
felt
comforted
for
the
tiny
thing
seemed
to
offer
its
small
friendship
and
remind
her
that
a
pleasant
world
was
still
to
be
enjoyed
dear
little
bird
see
jo
how
tame
it
is
i
like
peeps
better
than
the
gulls
they
are
not
so
wild
and
handsome
but
they
seem
happy
confiding
little
things
i
used
to
call
them
my
birds
last
summer
and
mother
said
they
reminded
her
of
me,--busy
quaker-colored
creatures
always
near
the
shore
and
always
chirping
that
contented
little
song
of
theirs
you
are
the
gull
jo
strong
and
wild
fond
of
the
storm
and
the
wind
flying
far
out
to
sea
and
happy
all
alone
meg
is
the
turtle-dove
and
amy
is
like
the
lark
she
writes
about
trying
to
get
up
among
the
clouds
but
always
dropping
down
into
its
nest
again
dear
little
girl
she's
so
ambitious
but
her
heart
is
good
and
tender
and
no
matter
how
high
she
flies
she
never
will
forget
home
i
hope
i
shall
see
her
again
but
she
seems
_so_
far
away
she
is
coming
in
the
spring
and
i
mean
that
you
shall
be
all
ready
to
see
and
enjoy
her
i'm
going
to
have
you
well
and
rosy
by
that
time
began
jo
feeling
that
of
all
the
changes
in
beth
the
talking
change
was
the
greatest
for
it
seemed
to
cost
no
effort
now
and
she
thought
aloud
in
a
way
quite
unlike
bashful
beth
jo
dear
don't
hope
any
more
it
won't
do
any
good
i'm
sure
of
that
we
won't
be
miserable
but
enjoy
being
together
while
we
wait
we'll
have
happy
times
for
i
don't
suffer
much
and
i
think
the
tide
will
go
out
easily
if
you
help
me
jo
leaned
down
to
kiss
the
tranquil
face
and
with
that
silent
kiss
she
dedicated
herself
soul
and
body
to
beth
she
was
right
there
was
no
need
of
any
words
when
they
got
home
for
father
and
mother
saw
plainly
now
what
they
had
prayed
to
be
saved
from
seeing
tired
with
her
short
journey
beth
went
at
once
to
bed
saying
how
glad
she
was
to
be
at
home
and
when
jo
went
down
she
found
that
she
would
be
spared
the
hard
task
of
telling
beth's
secret
her
father
stood
leaning
his
head
on
the
mantel-piece
and
did
not
turn
as
she
came
in
but
her
mother
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
for
help
and
jo
went
to
comfort
her
without
a
word
illustration
tail-piece
illustration
he
hurried
forward
to
meet
her
xxxvii
new
impressions
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
all
the
fashionable
world
at
nice
may
be
seen
on
the
promenade
des
anglais,--a
charming
place
for
the
wide
walk
bordered
with
palms
flowers
and
tropical
shrubs
is
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
sea
on
the
other
by
the
grand
drive
lined
with
hotels
and
villas
while
beyond
lie
orange-orchards
and
the
hills
many
nations
are
represented
many
languages
spoken
many
costumes
worn
and
on
a
sunny
day
the
spectacle
is
as
gay
and
brilliant
as
a
carnival
haughty
english
lively
french
sober
germans
handsome
spaniards
ugly
russians
meek
jews
free-and-easy
americans
all
drive
sit
or
saunter
here
chatting
over
the
news
and
criticising
the
latest
celebrity
who
has
arrived,--ristori
or
dickens
victor
emmanuel
or
the
queen
of
the
sandwich
islands
the
equipages
are
as
varied
as
the
company
and
attract
as
much
attention
especially
the
low
basket-barouches
in
which
ladies
drive
themselves
with
a
pair
of
dashing
ponies
gay
nets
to
keep
their
voluminous
flounces
from
overflowing
the
diminutive
vehicles
and
little
grooms
on
the
perch
behind
along
this
walk
on
christmas
day
a
tall
young
man
walked
slowly
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
a
somewhat
absent
expression
of
countenance
he
looked
like
an
italian
was
dressed
like
an
englishman
and
had
the
independent
air
of
an
american,--a
combination
which
caused
sundry
pairs
of
feminine
eyes
to
look
approvingly
after
him
and
sundry
dandies
in
black
velvet
suits
with
rose-colored
neckties
buff
gloves
and
orange-flowers
in
their
button-holes
to
shrug
their
shoulders
and
then
envy
him
his
inches
there
were
plenty
of
pretty
faces
to
admire
but
the
young
man
took
little
notice
of
them
except
to
glance
now
and
then
at
some
blonde
girl
or
lady
in
blue
presently
he
strolled
out
of
the
promenade
and
stood
a
moment
at
the
crossing
as
if
undecided
whether
to
go
and
listen
to
the
band
in
the
jardin
publique
or
to
wander
along
the
beach
toward
castle
hill
the
quick
trot
of
ponies'
feet
made
him
look
up
as
one
of
the
little
carriages
containing
a
single
lady
came
rapidly
down
the
street
the
lady
was
young
blonde
and
dressed
in
blue
he
stared
a
minute
then
his
whole
face
woke
up
and
waving
his
hat
like
a
boy
he
hurried
forward
to
meet
her
o
laurie
is
it
really
you
i
thought
you'd
never
come
cried
amy
dropping
the
reins
and
holding
out
both
hands
to
the
great
scandalization
of
a
french
mamma
who
hastened
her
daughter's
steps
lest
she
should
be
demoralized
by
beholding
the
free
manners
of
these
mad
english
i
was
detained
by
the
way
but
i
promised
to
spend
christmas
with
you
and
here
i
am
how
is
your
grandfather
when
did
you
come
where
are
you
staying
very
well--last
night--at
the
chauvain
i
called
at
your
hotel
but
you
were
all
out
i
have
so
much
to
say
i
don't
know
where
to
begin
get
in
and
we
can
talk
at
our
ease
i
was
going
for
a
drive
and
longing
for
company
flo's
saving
up
for
to-night
what
happens
then
a
ball
a
christmas
party
at
our
hotel
there
are
many
americans
there
and
they
give
it
in
honor
of
the
day
you'll
go
with
us
of
course
aunt
will
be
charmed
thank
you
where
now
asked
laurie
leaning
back
and
folding
his
arms
a
proceeding
which
suited
amy
who
preferred
to
drive
for
her
parasol-whip
and
blue
reins
over
the
white
ponies'
backs
afforded
her
infinite
satisfaction
i'm
going
to
the
banker's
first
for
letters
and
then
to
castle
hill
the
view
is
so
lovely
and
i
like
to
feed
the
peacocks
have
you
ever
been
there
often
years
ago
but
i
don't
mind
having
a
look
at
it
now
tell
me
all
about
yourself
the
last
i
heard
of
you
your
grandfather
wrote
that
he
expected
you
from
berlin
yes
i
spent
a
month
there
and
then
joined
him
in
paris
where
he
has
settled
for
the
winter
he
has
friends
there
and
finds
plenty
to
amuse
him
so
i
go
and
come
and
we
get
on
capitally
that's
a
sociable
arrangement
said
amy
missing
something
in
laurie's
manner
though
she
couldn't
tell
what
why
you
see
he
hates
to
travel
and
i
hate
to
keep
still
so
we
each
suit
ourselves
and
there
is
no
trouble
i
am
often
with
him
and
he
enjoys
my
adventures
while
i
like
to
feel
that
some
one
is
glad
to
see
me
when
i
get
back
from
my
wanderings
dirty
old
hole
isn't
it
he
added
with
a
look
of
disgust
as
they
drove
along
the
boulevard
to
the
place
napoleon
in
the
old
city
the
dirt
is
picturesque
so
i
don't
mind
the
river
and
the
hills
are
delicious
and
these
glimpses
of
the
narrow
cross-streets
are
my
delight
now
we
shall
have
to
wait
for
that
procession
to
pass
it's
going
to
the
church
of
st
john
while
laurie
listlessly
watched
the
procession
of
priests
under
their
canopies
white-veiled
nuns
bearing
lighted
tapers
and
some
brotherhood
in
blue
chanting
as
they
walked
amy
watched
him
and
felt
a
new
sort
of
shyness
steal
over
her
for
he
was
changed
and
she
could
not
find
the
merry-faced
boy
she
left
in
the
moody-looking
man
beside
her
he
was
handsomer
than
ever
and
greatly
improved
she
thought
but
now
that
the
flush
of
pleasure
at
meeting
her
was
over
he
looked
tired
and
spiritless,--not
sick
nor
exactly
unhappy
but
older
and
graver
than
a
year
or
two
of
prosperous
life
should
have
made
him
she
couldn't
understand
it
and
did
not
venture
to
ask
questions
so
she
shook
her
head
and
touched
up
her
ponies
as
the
procession
wound
away
across
the
arches
of
the
paglioni
bridge
and
vanished
in
the
church
_que
pensez
vous_
she
said
airing
her
french
which
had
improved
in
quantity
if
not
in
quality
since
she
came
abroad
that
mademoiselle
has
made
good
use
of
her
time
and
the
result
is
charming
replied
laurie
bowing
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
an
admiring
look
she
blushed
with
pleasure
but
somehow
the
compliment
did
not
satisfy
her
like
the
blunt
praises
he
used
to
give
her
at
home
when
he
promenaded
round
her
on
festival
occasions
and
told
her
she
was
altogether
jolly
with
a
hearty
smile
and
an
approving
pat
on
the
head
she
didn't
like
the
new
tone
for
though
not
_blasé_
it
sounded
indifferent
in
spite
of
the
look
if
that's
the
way
he's
going
to
grow
up
i
wish
he'd
stay
a
boy
she
thought
with
a
curious
sense
of
disappointment
and
discomfort
trying
meantime
to
seem
quite
easy
and
gay
at
avigdor's
she
found
the
precious
home-letters
and
giving
the
reins
to
laurie
read
them
luxuriously
as
they
wound
up
the
shady
road
between
green
hedges
where
tea-roses
bloomed
as
freshly
as
in
june
beth
is
very
poorly
mother
says
i
often
think
i
ought
to
go
home
but
they
all
say
'stay;'
so
i
do
for
i
shall
never
have
another
chance
like
this
said
amy
looking
sober
over
one
page
i
think
you
are
right
there
you
could
do
nothing
at
home
and
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
them
to
know
that
you
are
well
and
happy
and
enjoying
so
much
my
dear
he
drew
a
little
nearer
and
looked
more
like
his
old
self
as
he
said
that
and
the
fear
that
sometimes
weighed
on
amy's
heart
was
lightened
for
the
look
the
act
the
brotherly
my
dear
seemed
to
assure
her
that
if
any
trouble
did
come
she
would
not
be
alone
in
a
strange
land
presently
she
laughed
and
showed
him
a
small
sketch
of
jo
in
her
scribbling-suit
with
the
bow
rampantly
erect
upon
her
cap
and
issuing
from
her
mouth
the
words
genius
burns
laurie
smiled
took
it
put
it
in
his
vest-pocket
to
keep
it
from
blowing
away
and
listened
with
interest
to
the
lively
letter
amy
read
him
this
will
be
a
regularly
merry
christmas
to
me
with
presents
in
the
morning
you
and
letters
in
the
afternoon
and
a
party
at
night
said
amy
as
they
alighted
among
the
ruins
of
the
old
fort
and
a
flock
of
splendid
peacocks
came
trooping
about
them
tamely
waiting
to
be
fed
while
amy
stood
laughing
on
the
bank
above
him
as
she
scattered
crumbs
to
the
brilliant
birds
laurie
looked
at
her
as
she
had
looked
at
him
with
a
natural
curiosity
to
see
what
changes
time
and
absence
had
wrought
he
found
nothing
to
perplex
or
disappoint
much
to
admire
and
approve
for
overlooking
a
few
little
affectations
of
speech
and
manner
she
was
as
sprightly
and
graceful
as
ever
with
the
addition
of
that
indescribable
something
in
dress
and
bearing
which
we
call
elegance
always
mature
for
her
age
she
had
gained
a
certain
_aplomb_
in
both
carriage
and
conversation
which
made
her
seem
more
of
a
woman
of
the
world
than
she
was
but
her
old
petulance
now
and
then
showed
itself
her
strong
will
still
held
its
own
and
her
native
frankness
was
unspoiled
by
foreign
polish
laurie
did
not
read
all
this
while
he
watched
her
feed
the
peacocks
but
he
saw
enough
to
satisfy
and
interest
him
and
carried
away
a
pretty
little
picture
of
a
bright-faced
girl
standing
in
the
sunshine
which
brought
out
the
soft
hue
of
her
dress
the
fresh
color
of
her
cheeks
the
golden
gloss
of
her
hair
and
made
her
a
prominent
figure
in
the
pleasant
scene
as
they
came
up
on
to
the
stone
plateau
that
crowns
the
hill
amy
waved
her
hand
as
if
welcoming
him
to
her
favorite
haunt
and
said
pointing
here
and
there,--
do
you
remember
the
cathedral
and
the
corso
the
fishermen
dragging
their
nets
in
the
bay
and
the
lovely
road
to
villa
franca
schubert's
tower
just
below
and
best
of
all
that
speck
far
out
to
sea
which
they
say
is
corsica
i
remember
it's
not
much
changed
he
answered
without
enthusiasm
what
jo
would
give
for
a
sight
of
that
famous
speck
said
amy
feeling
in
good
spirits
and
anxious
to
see
him
so
also
yes
was
all
he
said
but
he
turned
and
strained
his
eyes
to
see
the
island
which
a
greater
usurper
than
even
napoleon
now
made
interesting
in
his
sight
take
a
good
look
at
it
for
her
sake
and
then
come
and
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
with
yourself
all
this
while
said
amy
seating
herself
ready
for
a
good
talk
but
she
did
not
get
it
for
though
he
joined
her
and
answered
all
her
questions
freely
she
could
only
learn
that
he
had
roved
about
the
continent
and
been
to
greece
so
after
idling
away
an
hour
they
drove
home
again
and
having
paid
his
respects
to
mrs
carrol
laurie
left
them
promising
to
return
in
the
evening
it
must
be
recorded
of
amy
that
she
deliberately
prinked
that
night
time
and
absence
had
done
its
work
on
both
the
young
people
she
had
seen
her
old
friend
in
a
new
light
not
as
our
boy
but
as
a
handsome
and
agreeable
man
and
she
was
conscious
of
a
very
natural
desire
to
find
favor
in
his
sight
amy
knew
her
good
points
and
made
the
most
of
them
with
the
taste
and
skill
which
is
a
fortune
to
a
poor
and
pretty
woman
tarlatan
and
tulle
were
cheap
at
nice
so
she
enveloped
herself
in
them
on
such
occasions
and
following
the
sensible
english
fashion
of
simple
dress
for
young
girls
got
up
charming
little
toilettes
with
fresh
flowers
a
few
trinkets
and
all
manner
of
dainty
devices
which
were
both
inexpensive
and
effective
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
artist
sometimes
got
possession
of
the
woman
and
indulged
in
antique
_coiffures_
statuesque
attitudes
and
classic
draperies
but
dear
heart
we
all
have
our
little
weaknesses
and
find
it
easy
to
pardon
such
in
the
young
who
satisfy
our
eyes
with
their
comeliness
and
keep
our
hearts
merry
with
their
artless
vanities
i
do
want
him
to
think
i
look
well
and
tell
them
so
at
home
said
amy
to
herself
as
she
put
on
flo's
old
white
silk
ball-dress
and
covered
it
with
a
cloud
of
fresh
illusion
out
of
which
her
white
shoulders
and
golden
head
emerged
with
a
most
artistic
effect
her
hair
she
had
the
sense
to
let
alone
after
gathering
up
the
thick
waves
and
curls
into
a
hebe-like
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
it's
not
the
fashion
but
it's
becoming
and
i
can't
afford
to
make
a
fright
of
myself
she
used
to
say
when
advised
to
frizzle
puff
or
braid
as
the
latest
style
commanded
having
no
ornaments
fine
enough
for
this
important
occasion
amy
looped
her
fleecy
skirts
with
rosy
clusters
of
azalea
and
framed
the
white
shoulders
in
delicate
green
vines
remembering
the
painted
boots
she
surveyed
her
white
satin
slippers
with
girlish
satisfaction
and
_chasséed_
down
the
room
admiring
her
aristocratic
feet
all
by
herself
my
new
fan
just
matches
my
flowers
my
gloves
fit
to
a
charm
and
the
real
lace
on
aunt's
_mouchoir_
gives
an
air
to
my
whole
dress
if
i
only
had
a
classical
nose
and
mouth
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
she
said
surveying
herself
with
a
critical
eye
and
a
candle
in
each
hand
in
spite
of
this
affliction
she
looked
unusually
gay
and
graceful
as
she
glided
away
she
seldom
ran,--it
did
not
suit
her
style
she
thought
for
being
tall
the
stately
and
junoesque
was
more
appropriate
than
the
sportive
or
piquante
she
walked
up
and
down
the
long
saloon
while
waiting
for
laurie
and
once
arranged
herself
under
the
chandelier
which
had
a
good
effect
upon
her
hair
then
she
thought
better
of
it
and
went
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
as
if
ashamed
of
the
girlish
desire
to
have
the
first
view
a
propitious
one
it
so
happened
that
she
could
not
have
done
a
better
thing
for
laurie
came
in
so
quietly
she
did
not
hear
him
and
as
she
stood
at
the
distant
window
with
her
head
half
turned
and
one
hand
gathering
up
her
dress
the
slender
white
figure
against
the
red
curtains
was
as
effective
as
a
well-placed
statue
good
evening
diana
said
laurie
with
the
look
of
satisfaction
she
liked
to
see
in
his
eyes
when
they
rested
on
her
good
evening
apollo
she
answered
smiling
back
at
him
for
he
too
looked
unusually
_debonnaire_
and
the
thought
of
entering
the
ball-room
on
the
arm
of
such
a
personable
man
caused
amy
to
pity
the
four
plain
misses
davis
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
here
are
your
flowers
i
arranged
them
myself
remembering
that
you
didn't
like
what
hannah
calls
a
'sot-bookay,'
said
laurie
handing
her
a
delicate
nosegay
in
a
holder
that
she
had
long
coveted
as
she
daily
passed
it
in
cardiglia's
window
illustration
here
are
your
flowers
how
kind
you
are
she
exclaimed
gratefully
if
i'd
known
you
were
coming
i'd
have
had
something
ready
for
you
to-day
though
not
as
pretty
as
this
i'm
afraid
thank
you
it
isn't
what
it
should
be
but
you
have
improved
it
he
added
as
she
snapped
the
silver
bracelet
on
her
wrist
please
don't
i
thought
you
liked
that
sort
of
thing
not
from
you
it
doesn't
sound
natural
and
i
like
your
old
bluntness
better
i'm
glad
of
it
he
answered
with
a
look
of
relief
then
buttoned
her
gloves
for
her
and
asked
if
his
tie
was
straight
just
as
he
used
to
do
when
they
went
to
parties
together
at
home
the
company
assembled
in
the
long
_salle
à
manger_
that
evening
was
such
as
one
sees
nowhere
but
on
the
continent
the
hospitable
americans
had
invited
every
acquaintance
they
had
in
nice
and
having
no
prejudice
against
titles
secured
a
few
to
add
lustre
to
their
christmas
ball
a
russian
prince
condescended
to
sit
in
a
corner
for
an
hour
and
talk
with
a
massive
lady
dressed
like
hamlet's
mother
in
black
velvet
with
a
pearl
bridle
under
her
chin
a
polish
count
aged
eighteen
devoted
himself
to
the
ladies
who
pronounced
him
a
fascinating
dear
and
a
german
serene
something
having
come
for
the
supper
alone
roamed
vaguely
about
seeking
what
he
might
devour
baron
rothschild's
private
secretary
a
large-nosed
jew
in
tight
boots
affably
beamed
upon
the
world
as
if
his
master's
name
crowned
him
with
a
golden
halo
a
stout
frenchman
who
knew
the
emperor
came
to
indulge
his
mania
for
dancing
and
lady
de
jones
a
british
matron
adorned
the
scene
with
her
little
family
of
eight
of
course
there
were
many
light-footed
shrill-voiced
american
girls
handsome
lifeless-looking
english
ditto
and
a
few
plain
but
piquante
french
demoiselles
likewise
the
usual
set
of
travelling
young
gentlemen
who
disported
themselves
gayly
while
mammas
of
all
nations
lined
the
walls
and
smiled
upon
them
benignly
when
they
danced
with
their
daughters
any
young
girl
can
imagine
amy's
state
of
mind
when
she
took
the
stage
that
night
leaning
on
laurie's
arm
she
knew
she
looked
well
she
loved
to
dance
she
felt
that
her
foot
was
on
her
native
heath
in
a
ball-room
and
enjoyed
the
delightful
sense
of
power
which
comes
when
young
girls
first
discover
the
new
and
lovely
kingdom
they
are
born
to
rule
by
virtue
of
beauty
youth
and
womanhood
she
did
pity
the
davis
girls
who
were
awkward
plain
and
destitute
of
escort
except
a
grim
papa
and
three
grimmer
maiden
aunts
and
she
bowed
to
them
in
her
friendliest
manner
as
she
passed
which
was
good
of
her
as
it
permitted
them
to
see
her
dress
and
burn
with
curiosity
to
know
who
her
distinguished-looking
friend
might
be
with
the
first
burst
of
the
band
amy's
color
rose
her
eyes
began
to
sparkle
and
her
feet
to
tap
the
floor
impatiently
for
she
danced
well
and
wanted
laurie
to
know
it
therefore
the
shock
she
received
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
when
he
said
in
a
perfectly
tranquil
tone,--
do
you
care
to
dance
one
usually
does
at
a
ball
her
amazed
look
and
quick
answer
caused
laurie
to
repair
his
error
as
fast
as
possible
i
meant
the
first
dance
may
i
have
the
honor
i
can
give
you
one
if
i
put
off
the
count
he
dances
divinely
but
he
will
excuse
me
as
you
are
an
old
friend
said
amy
hoping
that
the
name
would
have
a
good
effect
and
show
laurie
that
she
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
nice
little
boy
but
rather
a
short
pole
to
support
'a
daughter
of
the
gods
divinely
tall
and
most
divinely
fair,'
was
all
the
satisfaction
she
got
however
the
set
in
which
they
found
themselves
was
composed
of
english
and
amy
was
compelled
to
walk
decorously
through
a
cotillon
feeling
all
the
while
as
if
she
could
dance
the
tarantula
with
a
relish
laurie
resigned
her
to
the
nice
little
boy
and
went
to
do
his
duty
to
flo
without
securing
amy
for
the
joys
to
come
which
reprehensible
want
of
forethought
was
properly
punished
for
she
immediately
engaged
herself
till
supper
meaning
to
relent
if
he
then
gave
any
signs
of
penitence
she
showed
him
her
ball-book
with
demure
satisfaction
when
he
strolled
instead
of
rushing
up
to
claim
her
for
the
next
a
glorious
polka-redowa
but
his
polite
regrets
didn't
impose
upon
her
and
when
she
gallopaded
away
with
the
count
she
saw
laurie
sit
down
by
her
aunt
with
an
actual
expression
of
relief
that
was
unpardonable
and
amy
took
no
more
notice
of
him
for
a
long
while
except
a
word
now
and
then
when
she
came
to
her
chaperon
between
the
dances
for
a
necessary
pin
or
a
moment's
rest
her
anger
had
a
good
effect
however
for
she
hid
it
under
a
smiling
face
and
seemed
unusually
blithe
and
brilliant
laurie's
eyes
followed
her
with
pleasure
for
she
neither
romped
nor
sauntered
but
danced
with
spirit
and
grace
making
the
delightsome
pastime
what
it
should
be
he
very
naturally
fell
to
studying
her
from
this
new
point
of
view
and
before
the
evening
was
half
over
had
decided
that
little
amy
was
going
to
make
a
very
charming
woman
it
was
a
lively
scene
for
soon
the
spirit
of
the
social
season
took
possession
of
every
one
and
christmas
merriment
made
all
faces
shine
hearts
happy
and
heels
light
the
musicians
fiddled
tooted
and
banged
as
if
they
enjoyed
it
everybody
danced
who
could
and
those
who
couldn't
admired
their
neighbors
with
uncommon
warmth
the
air
was
dark
with
davises
and
many
joneses
gambolled
like
a
flock
of
young
giraffes
the
golden
secretary
darted
through
the
room
like
a
meteor
with
a
dashing
frenchwoman
who
carpeted
the
floor
with
her
pink
satin
train
the
serene
teuton
found
the
supper-table
and
was
happy
eating
steadily
through
the
bill
of
fare
and
dismayed
the
_garçons_
by
the
ravages
he
committed
but
the
emperor's
friend
covered
himself
with
glory
for
he
danced
everything
whether
he
knew
it
or
not
and
introduced
impromptu
pirouettes
when
the
figures
bewildered
him
the
boyish
abandon
of
that
stout
man
was
charming
to
behold
for
though
he
carried
weight
he
danced
like
an
india-rubber
ball
he
ran
he
flew
he
pranced
his
face
glowed
his
bald
head
shone
his
coat-tails
waved
wildly
his
pumps
actually
twinkled
in
the
air
and
when
the
music
stopped
he
wiped
the
drops
from
his
brow
and
beamed
upon
his
fellow-men
like
a
french
pickwick
without
glasses
amy
and
her
pole
distinguished
themselves
by
equal
enthusiasm
but
more
graceful
agility
and
laurie
found
himself
involuntarily
keeping
time
to
the
rhythmic
rise
and
fall
of
the
white
slippers
as
they
flew
by
as
indefatigably
as
if
winged
when
little
vladimir
finally
relinquished
her
with
assurances
that
he
was
desolated
to
leave
so
early
she
was
ready
to
rest
and
see
how
her
recreant
knight
had
borne
his
punishment
it
had
been
successful
for
at
three-and-twenty
blighted
affections
find
a
balm
in
friendly
society
and
young
nerves
will
thrill
young
blood
dance
and
healthy
young
spirits
rise
when
subjected
to
the
enchantment
of
beauty
light
music
and
motion
laurie
had
a
waked-up
look
as
he
rose
to
give
her
his
seat
and
when
he
hurried
away
to
bring
her
some
supper
she
said
to
herself
with
a
satisfied
smile,--
ah
i
thought
that
would
do
him
good
you
look
like
balzac's
'femme
peinte
par
elle-même,'
he
said
as
he
fanned
her
with
one
hand
and
held
her
coffee-cup
in
the
other
my
rouge
won't
come
off
and
amy
rubbed
her
brilliant
cheek
and
showed
him
her
white
glove
with
a
sober
simplicity
that
made
him
laugh
outright
what
do
you
call
this
stuff
he
asked
touching
a
fold
of
her
dress
that
had
blown
over
his
knee
illusion
good
name
for
it
it's
very
pretty--new
thing
isn't
it
it's
as
old
as
the
hills
you
have
seen
it
on
dozens
of
girls
and
you
never
found
out
that
it
was
pretty
till
now--_stupide_
i
never
saw
it
on
you
before
which
accounts
for
the
mistake
you
see
none
of
that
it
is
forbidden
i'd
rather
take
coffee
than
compliments
just
now
no
don't
lounge
it
makes
me
nervous
laurie
sat
bolt
upright
and
meekly
took
her
empty
plate
feeling
an
odd
sort
of
pleasure
in
having
little
amy
order
him
about
for
she
had
lost
her
shyness
now
and
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
trample
on
him
as
girls
have
a
delightful
way
of
doing
when
lords
of
creation
show
any
signs
of
subjection
where
did
you
learn
all
this
sort
of
thing
he
asked
with
a
quizzical
look
as
'this
sort
of
thing'
is
rather
a
vague
expression
would
you
kindly
explain
returned
amy
knowing
perfectly
well
what
he
meant
but
wickedly
leaving
him
to
describe
what
is
indescribable
well--the
general
air
the
style
the
self-possession
the--the--illusion--you
know
laughed
laurie
breaking
down
and
helping
himself
out
of
his
quandary
with
the
new
word
amy
was
gratified
but
of
course
didn't
show
it
and
demurely
answered
foreign
life
polishes
one
in
spite
of
one's
self
i
study
as
well
as
play
and
as
for
this"--with
a
little
gesture
toward
her
dress--"why
tulle
is
cheap
posies
to
be
had
for
nothing
and
i
am
used
to
making
the
most
of
my
poor
little
things
amy
rather
regretted
that
last
sentence
fearing
it
wasn't
in
good
taste
but
laurie
liked
her
the
better
for
it
and
found
himself
both
admiring
and
respecting
the
brave
patience
that
made
the
most
of
opportunity
and
the
cheerful
spirit
that
covered
poverty
with
flowers
amy
did
not
know
why
he
looked
at
her
so
kindly
nor
why
he
filled
up
her
book
with
his
own
name
and
devoted
himself
to
her
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
the
most
delightful
manner
but
the
impulse
that
wrought
this
agreeable
change
was
the
result
of
one
of
the
new
impressions
which
both
of
them
were
unconsciously
giving
and
receiving
illustration
demi
and
daisy
xxxviii
on
the
shelf
in
france
the
young
girls
have
a
dull
time
of
it
till
they
are
married
when
_vive
la
liberté_
becomes
their
motto
in
america
as
every
one
knows
girls
early
sign
the
declaration
of
independence
and
enjoy
their
freedom
with
republican
zest
but
the
young
matrons
usually
abdicate
with
the
first
heir
to
the
throne
and
go
into
a
seclusion
almost
as
close
as
a
french
nunnery
though
by
no
means
as
quiet
whether
they
like
it
or
not
they
are
virtually
put
upon
the
shelf
as
soon
as
the
wedding
excitement
is
over
and
most
of
them
might
exclaim
as
did
a
very
pretty
woman
the
other
day
i'm
as
handsome
as
ever
but
no
one
takes
any
notice
of
me
because
i'm
married
not
being
a
belle
or
even
a
fashionable
lady
meg
did
not
experience
this
affliction
till
her
babies
were
a
year
old
for
in
her
little
world
primitive
customs
prevailed
and
she
found
herself
more
admired
and
beloved
than
ever
as
she
was
a
womanly
little
woman
the
maternal
instinct
was
very
strong
and
she
was
entirely
absorbed
in
her
children
to
the
utter
exclusion
of
everything
and
everybody
else
day
and
night
she
brooded
over
them
with
tireless
devotion
and
anxiety
leaving
john
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
help
for
an
irish
lady
now
presided
over
the
kitchen
department
being
a
domestic
man
john
decidedly
missed
the
wifely
attentions
he
had
been
accustomed
to
receive
but
as
he
adored
his
babies
he
cheerfully
relinquished
his
comfort
for
a
time
supposing
with
masculine
ignorance
that
peace
would
soon
be
restored
but
three
months
passed
and
there
was
no
return
of
repose
meg
looked
worn
and
nervous
the
babies
absorbed
every
minute
of
her
time
the
house
was
neglected
and
kitty
the
cook
who
took
life
aisy
kept
him
on
short
commons
when
he
went
out
in
the
morning
he
was
bewildered
by
small
commissions
for
the
captive
mamma
if
he
came
gayly
in
at
night
eager
to
embrace
his
family
he
was
quenched
by
a
hush
they
are
just
asleep
after
worrying
all
day
if
he
proposed
a
little
amusement
at
home
no
it
would
disturb
the
babies
if
he
hinted
at
a
lecture
or
concert
he
was
answered
with
a
reproachful
look
and
a
decided
leave
my
children
for
pleasure
never
his
sleep
was
broken
by
infant
wails
and
visions
of
a
phantom
figure
pacing
noiselessly
to
and
fro
in
the
watches
of
the
night
his
meals
were
interrupted
by
the
frequent
flight
of
the
presiding
genius
who
deserted
him
half-helped
if
a
muffled
chirp
sounded
from
the
nest
above
and
when
he
read
his
paper
of
an
evening
demi's
colic
got
into
the
shipping-list
and
daisy's
fall
affected
the
price
of
stocks
for
mrs
brooke
was
only
interested
in
domestic
news
the
poor
man
was
very
uncomfortable
for
the
children
had
bereft
him
of
his
wife
home
was
merely
a
nursery
and
the
perpetual
hushing
made
him
feel
like
a
brutal
intruder
whenever
he
entered
the
sacred
precincts
of
babyland
he
bore
it
very
patiently
for
six
months
and
when
no
signs
of
amendment
appeared
he
did
what
other
paternal
exiles
do,--tried
to
get
a
little
comfort
elsewhere
scott
had
married
and
gone
to
housekeeping
not
far
off
and
john
fell
into
the
way
of
running
over
for
an
hour
or
two
of
an
evening
when
his
own
parlor
was
empty
and
his
own
wife
singing
lullabies
that
seemed
to
have
no
end
mrs
scott
was
a
lively
pretty
girl
with
nothing
to
do
but
be
agreeable
and
she
performed
her
mission
most
successfully
the
parlor
was
always
bright
and
attractive
the
chess-board
ready
the
piano
in
tune
plenty
of
gay
gossip
and
a
nice
little
supper
set
forth
in
tempting
style
john
would
have
preferred
his
own
fireside
if
it
had
not
been
so
lonely
but
as
it
was
he
gratefully
took
the
next
best
thing
and
enjoyed
his
neighbor's
society
meg
rather
approved
of
the
new
arrangement
at
first
and
found
it
a
relief
to
know
that
john
was
having
a
good
time
instead
of
dozing
in
the
parlor
or
tramping
about
the
house
and
waking
the
children
but
by
and
by
when
the
teething
worry
was
over
and
the
idols
went
to
sleep
at
proper
hours
leaving
mamma
time
to
rest
she
began
to
miss
john
and
find
her
work-basket
dull
company
when
he
was
not
sitting
opposite
in
his
old
dressing-gown
comfortably
scorching
his
slippers
on
the
fender
she
would
not
ask
him
to
stay
at
home
but
felt
injured
because
he
did
not
know
that
she
wanted
him
without
being
told
entirely
forgetting
the
many
evenings
he
had
waited
for
her
in
vain
she
was
nervous
and
worn
out
with
watching
and
worry
and
in
that
unreasonable
frame
of
mind
which
the
best
of
mothers
occasionally
experience
when
domestic
cares
oppress
them
want
of
exercise
robs
them
of
cheerfulness
and
too
much
devotion
to
that
idol
of
american
women
the
teapot
makes
them
feel
as
if
they
were
all
nerve
and
no
muscle
yes
she
would
say
looking
in
the
glass
i'm
getting
old
and
ugly
john
doesn't
find
me
interesting
any
longer
so
he
leaves
his
faded
wife
and
goes
to
see
his
pretty
neighbor
who
has
no
incumbrances
well
the
babies
love
me
they
don't
care
if
i
am
thin
and
pale
and
haven't
time
to
crimp
my
hair
they
are
my
comfort
and
some
day
john
will
see
what
i've
gladly
sacrificed
for
them
won't
he
my
precious
to
which
pathetic
appeal
daisy
would
answer
with
a
coo
or
demi
with
a
crow
and
meg
would
put
by
her
lamentations
for
a
maternal
revel
which
soothed
her
solitude
for
the
time
being
but
the
pain
increased
as
politics
absorbed
john
who
was
always
running
over
to
discuss
interesting
points
with
scott
quite
unconscious
that
meg
missed
him
not
a
word
did
she
say
however
till
her
mother
found
her
in
tears
one
day
and
insisted
on
knowing
what
the
matter
was
for
meg's
drooping
spirits
had
not
escaped
her
observation
i
wouldn't
tell
any
one
except
you
mother
but
i
really
do
need
advice
for
if
john
goes
on
so
much
longer
i
might
as
well
be
widowed
replied
mrs
brooke
drying
her
tears
on
daisy's
bib
with
an
injured
air
goes
on
how
my
dear
asked
her
mother
anxiously
he's
away
all
day
and
at
night
when
i
want
to
see
him
he
is
continually
going
over
to
the
scotts'
it
isn't
fair
that
i
should
have
the
hardest
work
and
never
any
amusement
men
are
very
selfish
even
the
best
of
them
so
are
women
don't
blame
john
till
you
see
where
you
are
wrong
yourself
but
it
can't
be
right
for
him
to
neglect
me
don't
you
neglect
him
why
mother
i
thought
you'd
take
my
part
so
i
do
as
far
as
sympathizing
goes
but
i
think
the
fault
is
yours
meg
i
don't
see
how
let
me
show
you
did
john
ever
neglect
you
as
you
call
it
while
you
made
it
a
point
to
give
him
your
society
of
an
evening
his
only
leisure
time
no
but
i
can't
do
it
now
with
two
babies
to
tend
i
think
you
could
dear
and
i
think
you
ought
may
i
speak
quite
freely
and
will
you
remember
that
it's
mother
who
blames
as
well
as
mother
who
sympathizes
indeed
i
will
speak
to
me
as
if
i
were
little
meg
again
i
often
feel
as
if
i
needed
teaching
more
than
ever
since
these
babies
look
to
me
for
everything
meg
drew
her
low
chair
beside
her
mother's
and
with
a
little
interruption
in
either
lap
the
two
women
rocked
and
talked
lovingly
together
feeling
that
the
tie
of
motherhood
made
them
more
one
than
ever
you
have
only
made
the
mistake
that
most
young
wives
make,--forgotten
your
duty
to
your
husband
in
your
love
for
your
children
a
very
natural
and
forgivable
mistake
meg
but
one
that
had
better
be
remedied
before
you
take
to
different
ways
for
children
should
draw
you
nearer
than
ever
not
separate
you
as
if
they
were
all
yours
and
john
had
nothing
to
do
but
support
them
i've
seen
it
for
some
weeks
but
have
not
spoken
feeling
sure
it
would
come
right
in
time
i'm
afraid
it
won't
if
i
ask
him
to
stay
he'll
think
i'm
jealous
and
i
wouldn't
insult
him
by
such
an
idea
he
doesn't
see
that
i
want
him
and
i
don't
know
how
to
tell
him
without
words
make
it
so
pleasant
he
won't
want
to
go
away
my
dear
he's
longing
for
his
little
home
but
it
isn't
home
without
you
and
you
are
always
in
the
nursery
oughtn't
i
to
be
there
not
all
the
time
too
much
confinement
makes
you
nervous
and
then
you
are
unfitted
for
everything
besides
you
owe
something
to
john
as
well
as
to
the
babies
don't
neglect
husband
for
children
don't
shut
him
out
of
the
nursery
but
teach
him
how
to
help
in
it
his
place
is
there
as
well
as
yours
and
the
children
need
him
let
him
feel
that
he
has
his
part
to
do
and
he
will
do
it
gladly
and
faithfully
and
it
will
be
better
for
you
all
you
really
think
so
mother
i
know
it
meg
for
i've
tried
it
and
i
seldom
give
advice
unless
i've
proved
its
practicability
when
you
and
jo
were
little
i
went
on
just
as
you
are
feeling
as
if
i
didn't
do
my
duty
unless
i
devoted
myself
wholly
to
you
poor
father
took
to
his
books
after
i
had
refused
all
offers
of
help
and
left
me
to
try
my
experiment
alone
i
struggled
along
as
well
as
i
could
but
jo
was
too
much
for
me
i
nearly
spoilt
her
by
indulgence
you
were
poorly
and
i
worried
about
you
till
i
fell
sick
myself
then
father
came
to
the
rescue
quietly
managed
everything
and
made
himself
so
helpful
that
i
saw
my
mistake
and
never
have
been
able
to
get
on
without
him
since
that
is
the
secret
of
our
home
happiness
he
does
not
let
business
wean
him
from
the
little
cares
and
duties
that
affect
us
all
and
i
try
not
to
let
domestic
worries
destroy
my
interest
in
his
pursuits
each
do
our
part
alone
in
many
things
but
at
home
we
work
together
always
it
is
so
mother
and
my
great
wish
is
to
be
to
my
husband
and
children
what
you
have
been
to
yours
show
me
how
i'll
do
anything
you
say
you
always
were
my
docile
daughter
well
dear
if
i
were
you
i'd
let
john
have
more
to
do
with
the
management
of
demi
for
the
boy
needs
training
and
it's
none
too
soon
to
begin
then
i'd
do
what
i
have
often
proposed
let
hannah
come
and
help
you
she
is
a
capital
nurse
and
you
may
trust
the
precious
babies
to
her
while
you
do
more
housework
you
need
the
exercise
hannah
would
enjoy
the
rest
and
john
would
find
his
wife
again
go
out
more
keep
cheerful
as
well
as
busy
for
you
are
the
sunshine-maker
of
the
family
and
if
you
get
dismal
there
is
no
fair
weather
then
i'd
try
to
take
an
interest
in
whatever
john
likes,--talk
with
him
let
him
read
to
you
exchange
ideas
and
help
each
other
in
that
way
don't
shut
yourself
up
in
a
bandbox
because
you
are
a
woman
but
understand
what
is
going
on
and
educate
yourself
to
take
your
part
in
the
world's
work
for
it
all
affects
you
and
yours
john
is
so
sensible
i'm
afraid
he
will
think
i'm
stupid
if
i
ask
questions
about
politics
and
things
i
don't
believe
he
would
love
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
and
of
whom
could
you
ask
more
freely
than
of
him
try
it
and
see
if
he
doesn't
find
your
society
far
more
agreeable
than
mrs
scott's
suppers
i
will
poor
john
i'm
afraid
i
_have_
neglected
him
sadly
but
i
thought
i
was
right
and
he
never
said
anything
he
tried
not
to
be
selfish
but
he
_has_
felt
rather
forlorn
i
fancy
this
is
just
the
time
meg
when
young
married
people
are
apt
to
grow
apart
and
the
very
time
when
they
ought
to
be
most
together
for
the
first
tenderness
soon
wears
off
unless
care
is
taken
to
preserve
it
and
no
time
is
so
beautiful
and
precious
to
parents
as
the
first
years
of
the
little
lives
given
them
to
train
don't
let
john
be
a
stranger
to
the
babies
for
they
will
do
more
to
keep
him
safe
and
happy
in
this
world
of
trial
and
temptation
than
anything
else
and
through
them
you
will
learn
to
know
and
love
one
another
as
you
should
now
dear
good-by
think
over
mother's
preachment
act
upon
it
if
it
seems
good
and
god
bless
you
all
meg
did
think
it
over
found
it
good
and
acted
upon
it
though
the
first
attempt
was
not
made
exactly
as
she
planned
to
have
it
of
course
the
children
tyrannized
over
her
and
ruled
the
house
as
soon
as
they
found
out
that
kicking
and
squalling
brought
them
whatever
they
wanted
mamma
was
an
abject
slave
to
their
caprices
but
papa
was
not
so
easily
subjugated
and
occasionally
afflicted
his
tender
spouse
by
an
attempt
at
paternal
discipline
with
his
obstreperous
son
for
demi
inherited
a
trifle
of
his
sire's
firmness
of
character,--we
won't
call
it
obstinacy,--and
when
he
made
up
his
little
mind
to
have
or
to
do
anything
all
the
king's
horses
and
all
the
king's
men
could
not
change
that
pertinacious
little
mind
mamma
thought
the
dear
too
young
to
be
taught
to
conquer
his
prejudices
but
papa
believed
that
it
never
was
too
soon
to
learn
obedience
so
master
demi
early
discovered
that
when
he
undertook
to
wrastle
with
parpar
he
always
got
the
worst
of
it
yet
like
the
englishman
baby
respected
the
man
who
conquered
him
and
loved
the
father
whose
grave
no
no
was
more
impressive
than
all
mamma's
love-pats
a
few
days
after
the
talk
with
her
mother
meg
resolved
to
try
a
social
evening
with
john
so
she
ordered
a
nice
supper
set
the
parlor
in
order
dressed
herself
prettily
and
put
the
children
to
bed
early
that
nothing
should
interfere
with
her
experiment
but
unfortunately
demi's
most
unconquerable
prejudice
was
against
going
to
bed
and
that
night
he
decided
to
go
on
a
rampage
so
poor
meg
sung
and
rocked
told
stories
and
tried
every
sleep-provoking
wile
she
could
devise
but
all
in
vain
the
big
eyes
wouldn't
shut
and
long
after
daisy
had
gone
to
byelow
like
the
chubby
little
bunch
of
good-nature
she
was
naughty
demi
lay
staring
at
the
light
with
the
most
discouragingly
wide-awake
expression
of
countenance
will
demi
lie
still
like
a
good
boy
while
mamma
runs
down
and
gives
poor
papa
his
tea
asked
meg
as
the
hall-door
softly
closed
and
the
well-known
step
went
tiptoeing
into
the
dining-room
me
has
tea
said
demi
preparing
to
join
in
the
revel
no
but
i'll
save
you
some
little
cakies
for
breakfast
if
you'll
go
bye-by
like
daisy
will
you
lovey
iss
and
demi
shut
his
eyes
tight
as
if
to
catch
sleep
and
hurry
the
desired
day
taking
advantage
of
the
propitious
moment
meg
slipped
away
and
ran
down
to
greet
her
husband
with
a
smiling
face
and
the
little
blue
bow
in
her
hair
which
was
his
especial
admiration
he
saw
it
at
once
and
said
with
pleased
surprise,--
why
little
mother
how
gay
we
are
to-night
do
you
expect
company
only
you
dear
is
it
a
birthday
anniversary
or
anything
no
i'm
tired
of
being
a
dowdy
so
i
dressed
up
as
a
change
you
always
make
yourself
nice
for
table
no
matter
how
tired
you
are
so
why
shouldn't
i
when
i
have
the
time
i
do
it
out
of
respect
to
you
my
dear
said
old-fashioned
john
ditto
ditto
mr
brooke
laughed
meg
looking
young
and
pretty
again
as
she
nodded
to
him
over
the
teapot
well
it's
altogether
delightful
and
like
old
times
this
tastes
right
i
drink
your
health
dear
and
john
sipped
his
tea
with
an
air
of
reposeful
rapture
which
was
of
very
short
duration
however
for
as
he
put
down
his
cup
the
door-handle
rattled
mysteriously
and
a
little
voice
was
heard
saying
impatiently,--
opy
doy
me's
tummin
it's
that
naughty
boy
i
told
him
to
go
to
sleep
alone
and
here
he
is
downstairs
getting
his
death
a-cold
pattering
over
that
canvas
said
meg
answering
the
call
illustration
mornin'
now
mornin'
now
announced
demi
in
a
joyful
tone
as
he
entered
with
his
long
night-gown
gracefully
festooned
over
his
arm
and
every
curl
bobbing
gayly
as
he
pranced
about
the
table
eying
the
cakies
with
loving
glances
no
it
isn't
morning
yet
you
must
go
to
bed
and
not
trouble
poor
mamma
then
you
can
have
the
little
cake
with
sugar
on
it
me
loves
parpar
said
the
artful
one
preparing
to
climb
the
paternal
knee
and
revel
in
forbidden
joys
but
john
shook
his
head
and
said
to
meg,--
if
you
told
him
to
stay
up
there
and
go
to
sleep
alone
make
him
do
it
or
he
will
never
learn
to
mind
you
yes
of
course
come
demi
and
meg
led
her
son
away
feeling
a
strong
desire
to
spank
the
little
marplot
who
hopped
beside
her
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
bribe
was
to
be
administered
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
nursery
nor
was
he
disappointed
for
that
short-sighted
woman
actually
gave
him
a
lump
of
sugar
tucked
him
into
his
bed
and
forbade
any
more
promenades
till
morning
iss
said
demi
the
perjured
blissfully
sucking
his
sugar
and
regarding
his
first
attempt
as
eminently
successful
meg
returned
to
her
place
and
supper
was
progressing
pleasantly
when
the
little
ghost
walked
again
and
exposed
the
maternal
delinquencies
by
boldly
demanding,--
more
sudar
marmar
now
this
won't
do
said
john
hardening
his
heart
against
the
engaging
little
sinner
we
shall
never
know
any
peace
till
that
child
learns
to
go
to
bed
properly
you
have
made
a
slave
of
yourself
long
enough
give
him
one
lesson
and
then
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
put
him
in
his
bed
and
leave
him
meg
he
won't
stay
there
he
never
does
unless
i
sit
by
him
i'll
manage
him
demi
go
upstairs
and
get
into
your
bed
as
mamma
bids
you
s'ant
replied
the
young
rebel
helping
himself
to
the
coveted
cakie
and
beginning
to
eat
the
same
with
calm
audacity
you
must
never
say
that
to
papa
i
shall
carry
you
if
you
don't
go
yourself
go
'way
me
don't
love
parpar
and
demi
retired
to
his
mother's
skirts
for
protection
but
even
that
refuge
proved
unavailing
for
he
was
delivered
over
to
the
enemy
with
a
be
gentle
with
him
john
which
struck
the
culprit
with
dismay
for
when
mamma
deserted
him
then
the
judgment-day
was
at
hand
bereft
of
his
cake
defrauded
of
his
frolic
and
borne
away
by
a
strong
hand
to
that
detested
bed
poor
demi
could
not
restrain
his
wrath
but
openly
defied
papa
and
kicked
and
screamed
lustily
all
the
way
upstairs
the
minute
he
was
put
into
bed
on
one
side
he
rolled
out
on
the
other
and
made
for
the
door
only
to
be
ignominiously
caught
up
by
the
tail
of
his
little
toga
and
put
back
again
which
lively
performance
was
kept
up
till
the
young
man's
strength
gave
out
when
he
devoted
himself
to
roaring
at
the
top
of
his
voice
this
vocal
exercise
usually
conquered
meg
but
john
sat
as
unmoved
as
the
post
which
is
popularly
believed
to
be
deaf
no
coaxing
no
sugar
no
lullaby
no
story
even
the
light
was
put
out
and
only
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
enlivened
the
big
dark
which
demi
regarded
with
curiosity
rather
than
fear
this
new
order
of
things
disgusted
him
and
he
howled
dismally
for
marmar
as
his
angry
passions
subsided
and
recollections
of
his
tender
bondwoman
returned
to
the
captive
autocrat
the
plaintive
wail
which
succeeded
the
passionate
roar
went
to
meg's
heart
and
she
ran
up
to
say
beseechingly,--
let
me
stay
with
him
he'll
be
good
now
john
no
my
dear
i've
told
him
he
must
go
to
sleep
as
you
bid
him
and
he
must
if
i
stay
here
all
night
but
he'll
cry
himself
sick
pleaded
meg
reproaching
herself
for
deserting
her
boy
no
he
won't
he's
so
tired
he
will
soon
drop
off
and
then
the
matter
is
settled
for
he
will
understand
that
he
has
got
to
mind
don't
interfere
i'll
manage
him
he's
my
child
and
i
can't
have
his
spirit
broken
by
harshness
he's
my
child
and
i
won't
have
his
temper
spoilt
by
indulgence
go
down
my
dear
and
leave
the
boy
to
me
when
john
spoke
in
that
masterful
tone
meg
always
obeyed
and
never
regretted
her
docility
please
let
me
kiss
him
once
john
certainly
demi
say
'good-night'
to
mamma
and
let
her
go
and
rest
for
she
is
very
tired
with
taking
care
of
you
all
day
meg
always
insisted
upon
it
that
the
kiss
won
the
victory
for
after
it
was
given
demi
sobbed
more
quietly
and
lay
quite
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
whither
he
had
wriggled
in
his
anguish
of
mind
poor
little
man
he's
worn
out
with
sleep
and
crying
i'll
cover
him
up
and
then
go
and
set
meg's
heart
at
rest
thought
john
creeping
to
the
bedside
hoping
to
find
his
rebellious
heir
asleep
but
he
wasn't
for
the
moment
his
father
peeped
at
him
demi's
eyes
opened
his
little
chin
began
to
quiver
and
he
put
up
his
arms
saying
with
a
penitent
hiccough
me's
dood
now
sitting
on
the
stairs
outside
meg
wondered
at
the
long
silence
which
followed
the
uproar
and
after
imagining
all
sorts
of
impossible
accidents
she
slipped
into
the
room
to
set
her
fears
at
rest
demi
lay
fast
asleep
not
in
his
usual
spread-eagle
attitude
but
in
a
subdued
bunch
cuddled
close
in
the
circle
of
his
father's
arm
and
holding
his
father's
finger
as
if
he
felt
that
justice
was
tempered
with
mercy
and
had
gone
to
sleep
a
sadder
and
a
wiser
baby
so
held
john
had
waited
with
womanly
patience
till
the
little
hand
relaxed
its
hold
and
while
waiting
had
fallen
asleep
more
tired
by
that
tussle
with
his
son
than
with
his
whole
day's
work
as
meg
stood
watching
the
two
faces
on
the
pillow
she
smiled
to
herself
and
then
slipped
away
again
saying
in
a
satisfied
tone,--
i
never
need
fear
that
john
will
be
too
harsh
with
my
babies
he
_does_
know
how
to
manage
them
and
will
be
a
great
help
for
demi
_is_
getting
too
much
for
me
when
john
came
down
at
last
expecting
to
find
a
pensive
or
reproachful
wife
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
meg
placidly
trimming
a
bonnet
and
to
be
greeted
with
the
request
to
read
something
about
the
election
if
he
was
not
too
tired
john
saw
in
a
minute
that
a
revolution
of
some
kind
was
going
on
but
wisely
asked
no
questions
knowing
that
meg
was
such
a
transparent
little
person
she
couldn't
keep
a
secret
to
save
her
life
and
therefore
the
clew
would
soon
appear
he
read
a
long
debate
with
the
most
amiable
readiness
and
then
explained
it
in
his
most
lucid
manner
while
meg
tried
to
look
deeply
interested
to
ask
intelligent
questions
and
keep
her
thoughts
from
wandering
from
the
state
of
the
nation
to
the
state
of
her
bonnet
in
her
secret
soul
however
she
decided
that
politics
were
as
bad
as
mathematics
and
that
the
mission
of
politicians
seemed
to
be
calling
each
other
names
but
she
kept
these
feminine
ideas
to
herself
and
when
john
paused
shook
her
head
and
said
with
what
she
thought
diplomatic
ambiguity,--
well
i
really
don't
see
what
we
are
coming
to
john
laughed
and
watched
her
for
a
minute
as
she
poised
a
pretty
little
preparation
of
lace
and
flowers
on
her
hand
and
regarded
it
with
the
genuine
interest
which
his
harangue
had
failed
to
waken
she
is
trying
to
like
politics
for
my
sake
so
i'll
try
and
like
millinery
for
hers
that's
only
fair
thought
john
the
just
adding
aloud,--
that's
very
pretty
is
it
what
you
call
a
breakfast-cap
illustration
my
dear
man
it's
a
bonnet
my
dear
man
it's
a
bonnet
my
very
best
go-to-concert-and-theatre
bonnet
i
beg
your
pardon
it
was
so
small
i
naturally
mistook
it
for
one
of
the
fly-away
things
you
sometimes
wear
how
do
you
keep
it
on
these
bits
of
lace
are
fastened
under
the
chin
with
a
rosebud
so
and
meg
illustrated
by
putting
on
the
bonnet
and
regarding
him
with
an
air
of
calm
satisfaction
that
was
irresistible
it's
a
love
of
a
bonnet
but
i
prefer
the
face
inside
for
it
looks
young
and
happy
again
and
john
kissed
the
smiling
face
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
rosebud
under
the
chin
i'm
glad
you
like
it
for
i
want
you
to
take
me
to
one
of
the
new
concerts
some
night
i
really
need
some
music
to
put
me
in
tune
will
you
please
of
course
i
will
with
all
my
heart
or
anywhere
else
you
like
you
have
been
shut
up
so
long
it
will
do
you
no
end
of
good
and
i
shall
enjoy
it
of
all
things
what
put
it
into
your
head
little
mother
well
i
had
a
talk
with
marmee
the
other
day
and
told
her
how
nervous
and
cross
and
out
of
sorts
i
felt
and
she
said
i
needed
change
and
less
care
so
hannah
is
to
help
me
with
the
children
and
i'm
to
see
to
things
about
the
house
more
and
now
and
then
have
a
little
fun
just
to
keep
me
from
getting
to
be
a
fidgety
broken-down
old
woman
before
my
time
it's
only
an
experiment
john
and
i
want
to
try
it
for
your
sake
as
much
as
for
mine
because
i've
neglected
you
shamefully
lately
and
i'm
going
to
make
home
what
it
used
to
be
if
i
can
you
don't
object
i
hope
never
mind
what
john
said
or
what
a
very
narrow
escape
the
little
bonnet
had
from
utter
ruin
all
that
we
have
any
business
to
know
is
that
john
did
_not_
appear
to
object
judging
from
the
changes
which
gradually
took
place
in
the
house
and
its
inmates
it
was
not
all
paradise
by
any
means
but
every
one

lazy
laurence
laurie
went
to
nice
intending
to
stay
a
week
and
remained
a
month
he
was
tired
of
wandering
about
alone
and
amy's
familiar
presence
seemed
to
give
a
home-like
charm
to
the
foreign
scenes
in
which
she
bore
a
part
he
rather
missed
the
petting
he
used
to
receive
and
enjoyed
a
taste
of
it
again
for
no
attentions
however
flattering
from
strangers
were
half
so
pleasant
as
the
sisterly
adoration
of
the
girls
at
home
amy
never
would
pet
him
like
the
others
but
she
was
very
glad
to
see
him
now
and
quite
clung
to
him
feeling
that
he
was
the
representative
of
the
dear
family
for
whom
she
longed
more
than
she
would
confess
they
naturally
took
comfort
in
each
other's
society
and
were
much
together
riding
walking
dancing
or
dawdling
for
at
nice
no
one
can
be
very
industrious
during
the
gay
season
but
while
apparently
amusing
themselves
in
the
most
careless
fashion
they
were
half-consciously
making
discoveries
and
forming
opinions
about
each
other
amy
rose
daily
in
the
estimation
of
her
friend
but
he
sunk
in
hers
and
each
felt
the
truth
before
a
word
was
spoken
amy
tried
to
please
and
succeeded
for
she
was
grateful
for
the
many
pleasures
he
gave
her
and
repaid
him
with
the
little
services
to
which
womanly
women
know
how
to
lend
an
indescribable
charm
laurie
made
no
effort
of
any
kind
but
just
let
himself
drift
along
as
comfortably
as
possible
trying
to
forget
and
feeling
that
all
women
owed
him
a
kind
word
because
one
had
been
cold
to
him
it
cost
him
no
effort
to
be
generous
and
he
would
have
given
amy
all
the
trinkets
in
nice
if
she
would
have
taken
them
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
he
could
not
change
the
opinion
she
was
forming
of
him
and
he
rather
dreaded
the
keen
blue
eyes
that
seemed
to
watch
him
with
such
half-sorrowful
half-scornful
surprise
all
the
rest
have
gone
to
monaco
for
the
day
i
preferred
to
stay
at
home
and
write
letters
they
are
done
now
and
i
am
going
to
valrosa
to
sketch
will
you
come
said
amy
as
she
joined
laurie
one
lovely
day
when
he
lounged
in
as
usual
about
noon
well
yes
but
isn't
it
rather
warm
for
such
a
long
walk
he
answered
slowly
for
the
shaded
_salon_
looked
inviting
after
the
glare
without
i'm
going
to
have
the
little
carriage
and
baptiste
can
drive
so
you'll
have
nothing
to
do
but
hold
your
umbrella
and
keep
your
gloves
nice
returned
amy
with
a
sarcastic
glance
at
the
immaculate
kids
which
were
a
weak
point
with
laurie
then
i'll
go
with
pleasure
and
he
put
out
his
hand
for
her
sketch-book
but
she
tucked
it
under
her
arm
with
a
sharp--
don't
trouble
yourself
it's
no
exertion
to
me
but
_you_
don't
look
equal
to
it
laurie
lifted
his
eyebrows
and
followed
at
a
leisurely
pace
as
she
ran
downstairs
but
when
they
got
into
the
carriage
he
took
the
reins
himself
and
left
little
baptiste
nothing
to
do
but
fold
his
arms
and
fall
asleep
on
his
perch
the
two
never
quarrelled,--amy
was
too
well-bred
and
just
now
laurie
was
too
lazy
so
in
a
minute
he
peeped
under
her
hat-brim
with
an
inquiring
air
she
answered
with
a
smile
and
they
went
on
together
in
the
most
amicable
manner
it
was
a
lovely
drive
along
winding
roads
rich
in
the
picturesque
scenes
that
delight
beauty-loving
eyes
here
an
ancient
monastery
whence
the
solemn
chanting
of
the
monks
came
down
to
them
there
a
bare-legged
shepherd
in
wooden
shoes
pointed
hat
and
rough
jacket
over
one
shoulder
sat
piping
on
a
stone
while
his
goats
skipped
among
the
rocks
or
lay
at
his
feet
meek
mouse-colored
donkeys
laden
with
panniers
of
freshly-cut
grass
passed
by
with
a
pretty
girl
in
a
_capaline_
sitting
between
the
green
piles
or
an
old
woman
spinning
with
a
distaff
as
she
went
brown
soft-eyed
children
ran
out
from
the
quaint
stone
hovels
to
offer
nosegays
or
bunches
of
oranges
still
on
the
bough
gnarled
olive-trees
covered
the
hills
with
their
dusky
foliage
fruit
hung
golden
in
the
orchard
and
great
scarlet
anemones
fringed
the
roadside
while
beyond
green
slopes
and
craggy
heights
the
maritime
alps
rose
sharp
and
white
against
the
blue
italian
sky
valrosa
well
deserved
its
name
for
in
that
climate
of
perpetual
summer
roses
blossomed
everywhere
they
overhung
the
archway
thrust
themselves
between
the
bars
of
the
great
gate
with
a
sweet
welcome
to
passers-by
and
lined
the
avenue
winding
through
lemon-trees
and
feathery
palms
up
to
the
villa
on
the
hill
every
shadowy
nook
where
seats
invited
one
to
stop
and
rest
was
a
mass
of
bloom
every
cool
grotto
had
its
marble
nymph
smiling
from
a
veil
of
flowers
and
every
fountain
reflected
crimson
white
or
pale
pink
roses
leaning
down
to
smile
at
their
own
beauty
roses
covered
the
walls
of
the
house
draped
the
cornices
climbed
the
pillars
and
ran
riot
over
the
balustrade
of
the
wide
terrace
whence
one
looked
down
on
the
sunny
mediterranean
and
the
white-walled
city
on
its
shore
this
is
a
regular
honeymoon
paradise
isn't
it
did
you
ever
see
such
roses
asked
amy
pausing
on
the
terrace
to
enjoy
the
view
and
a
luxurious
whiff
of
perfume
that
came
wandering
by
no
nor
felt
such
thorns
returned
laurie
with
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
after
a
vain
attempt
to
capture
a
solitary
scarlet
flower
that
grew
just
beyond
his
reach
try
lower
down
and
pick
those
that
have
no
thorns
said
amy
gathering
three
of
the
tiny
cream-colored
ones
that
starred
the
wall
behind
her
she
put
them
in
his
button-hole
as
a
peace-offering
and
he
stood
a
minute
looking
down
at
them
with
a
curious
expression
for
in
the
italian
part
of
his
nature
there
was
a
touch
of
superstition
and
he
was
just
then
in
that
state
of
half-sweet
half-bitter
melancholy
when
imaginative
young
men
find
significance
in
trifles
and
food
for
romance
everywhere
he
had
thought
of
jo
in
reaching
after
the
thorny
red
rose
for
vivid
flowers
became
her
and
she
had
often
worn
ones
like
that
from
the
greenhouse
at
home
the
pale
roses
amy
gave
him
were
the
sort
that
the
italians
lay
in
dead
hands
never
in
bridal
wreaths
and
for
a
moment
he
wondered
if
the
omen
was
for
jo
or
for
himself
but
the
next
instant
his
american
common-sense
got
the
better
of
sentimentality
and
he
laughed
a
heartier
laugh
than
amy
had
heard
since
he
came
it's
good
advice
you'd
better
take
it
and
save
your
fingers
she
said
thinking
her
speech
amused
him
thank
you
i
will
he
answered
in
jest
and
a
few
months
later
he
did
it
in
earnest
laurie
when
are
you
going
to
your
grandfather
she
asked
presently
as
she
settled
herself
on
a
rustic
seat
very
soon
you
have
said
that
a
dozen
times
within
the
last
three
weeks
i
dare
say
short
answers
save
trouble
he
expects
you
and
you
really
ought
to
go
hospitable
creature
i
know
it
then
why
don't
you
do
it
natural
depravity
i
suppose
natural
indolence
you
mean
it's
really
dreadful
and
amy
looked
severe
not
so
bad
as
it
seems
for
i
should
only
plague
him
if
i
went
so
i
might
as
well
stay
and
plague
you
a
little
longer
you
can
bear
it
better
in
fact
i
think
it
agrees
with
you
excellently
and
laurie
composed
himself
for
a
lounge
on
the
broad
ledge
of
the
balustrade
amy
shook
her
head
and
opened
her
sketch-book
with
an
air
of
resignation
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
lecture
that
boy
and
in
a
minute
she
began
again
what
are
you
doing
just
now
watching
lizards
no
no
i
mean
what
do
you
intend
and
wish
to
do
smoke
a
cigarette
if
you'll
allow
me
how
provoking
you
are
i
don't
approve
of
cigars
and
i
will
only
allow
it
on
condition
that
you
let
me
put
you
into
my
sketch
i
need
a
figure
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
how
will
you
have
me,--full-length
or
three-quarters
on
my
head
or
my
heels
i
should
respectfully
suggest
a
recumbent
posture
then
put
yourself
in
also
and
call
it
'_dolce
far
niente._'
stay
as
you
are
and
go
to
sleep
if
you
like
_i_
intend
to
work
hard
said
amy
in
her
most
energetic
tone
what
delightful
enthusiasm
and
he
leaned
against
a
tall
urn
with
an
air
of
entire
satisfaction
what
would
jo
say
if
she
saw
you
now
asked
amy
impatiently
hoping
to
stir
him
up
by
the
mention
of
her
still
more
energetic
sister's
name
as
usual
'go
away
teddy
i'm
busy!'
he
laughed
as
he
spoke
but
the
laugh
was
not
natural
and
a
shade
passed
over
his
face
for
the
utterance
of
the
familiar
name
touched
the
wound
that
was
not
healed
yet
both
tone
and
shadow
struck
amy
for
she
had
seen
and
heard
them
before
and
now
she
looked
up
in
time
to
catch
a
new
expression
on
laurie's
face,--a
hard
bitter
look
full
of
pain
dissatisfaction
and
regret
it
was
gone
before
she
could
study
it
and
the
listless
expression
back
again
she
watched
him
for
a
moment
with
artistic
pleasure
thinking
how
like
an
italian
he
looked
as
he
lay
basking
in
the
sun
with
uncovered
head
and
eyes
full
of
southern
dreaminess
for
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
and
fallen
into
a
reverie
you
look
like
the
effigy
of
a
young
knight
asleep
on
his
tomb
she
said
carefully
tracing
the
well-cut
profile
defined
against
the
dark
stone
wish
i
was
that's
a
foolish
wish
unless
you
have
spoilt
your
life
you
are
so
changed
i
sometimes
think--
there
amy
stopped
with
a
half-timid
half-wistful
look
more
significant
than
her
unfinished
speech
laurie
saw
and
understood
the
affectionate
anxiety
which
she
hesitated
to
express
and
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
said
just
as
he
used
to
say
it
to
her
mother,--
it's
all
right
ma'am
that
satisfied
her
and
set
at
rest
the
doubts
that
had
begun
to
worry
her
lately
it
also
touched
her
and
she
showed
that
it
did
by
the
cordial
tone
in
which
she
said,--
i'm
glad
of
that
i
didn't
think
you'd
been
a
very
bad
boy
but
i
fancied
you
might
have
wasted
money
at
that
wicked
baden-baden
lost
your
heart
to
some
charming
frenchwoman
with
a
husband
or
got
into
some
of
the
scrapes
that
young
men
seem
to
consider
a
necessary
part
of
a
foreign
tour
don't
stay
out
there
in
the
sun
come
and
lie
on
the
grass
here
and
'let
us
be
friendly,'
as
jo
used
to
say
when
we
got
in
the
sofa-corner
and
told
secrets
illustration
laurie
threw
himself
down
on
the
turf
laurie
obediently
threw
himself
down
on
the
turf
and
began
to
amuse
himself
by
sticking
daisies
into
the
ribbons
of
amy's
hat
that
lay
there
i'm
all
ready
for
the
secrets
and
he
glanced
up
with
a
decided
expression
of
interest
in
his
eyes
i've
none
to
tell
you
may
begin
haven't
one
to
bless
myself
with
i
thought
perhaps
you'd
had
some
news
from
home
you
have
heard
all
that
has
come
lately
don't
you
hear
often
i
fancied
jo
would
send
you
volumes
she's
very
busy
i'm
roving
about
so
it's
impossible
to
be
regular
you
know
when
do
you
begin
your
great
work
of
art
raphaella
he
asked
changing
the
subject
abruptly
after
another
pause
in
which
he
had
been
wondering
if
amy
knew
his
secret
and
wanted
to
talk
about
it
never
she
answered
with
a
despondent
but
decided
air
rome
took
all
the
vanity
out
of
me
for
after
seeing
the
wonders
there
i
felt
too
insignificant
to
live
and
gave
up
all
my
foolish
hopes
in
despair
why
should
you
with
so
much
energy
and
talent
that's
just
why,--because
talent
isn't
genius
and
no
amount
of
energy
can
make
it
so
i
want
to
be
great
or
nothing
i
won't
be
a
common-place
dauber
so
i
don't
intend
to
try
any
more
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
now
if
i
may
ask
polish
up
my
other
talents
and
be
an
ornament
to
society
if
i
get
the
chance
it
was
a
characteristic
speech
and
sounded
daring
but
audacity
becomes
young
people
and
amy's
ambition
had
a
good
foundation
laurie
smiled
but
he
liked
the
spirit
with
which
she
took
up
a
new
purpose
when
a
long-cherished
one
died
and
spent
no
time
lamenting
good
and
here
is
where
fred
vaughn
comes
in
i
fancy
amy
preserved
a
discreet
silence
but
there
was
a
conscious
look
in
her
downcast
face
that
made
laurie
sit
up
and
say
gravely,--
now
i'm
going
to
play
brother
and
ask
questions
may
i
i
don't
promise
to
answer
your
face
will
if
your
tongue
won't
you
aren't
woman
of
the
world
enough
yet
to
hide
your
feelings
my
dear
i
heard
rumors
about
fred
and
you
last
year
and
it's
my
private
opinion
that
if
he
had
not
been
called
home
so
suddenly
and
detained
so
long
something
would
have
come
of
it--hey
that's
not
for
me
to
say
was
amy's
prim
reply
but
her
lips
would
smile
and
there
was
a
traitorous
sparkle
of
the
eye
which
betrayed
that
she
knew
her
power
and
enjoyed
the
knowledge
you
are
not
engaged
i
hope
and
laurie
looked
very
elder-brotherly
and
grave
all
of
a
sudden
no
but
you
will
be
if
he
comes
back
and
goes
properly
down
upon
his
knees
won't
you
very
likely
then
you
are
fond
of
old
fred
i
could
be
if
i
tried
but
you
don't
intend
to
try
till
the
proper
moment
bless
my
soul
what
unearthly
prudence
he's
a
good
fellow
amy
but
not
the
man
i
fancied
you'd
like
he
is
rich
a
gentleman
and
has
delightful
manners
began
amy
trying
to
be
quite
cool
and
dignified
but
feeling
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
in
spite
of
the
sincerity
of
her
intentions
i
understand
queens
of
society
can't
get
on
without
money
so
you
mean
to
make
a
good
match
and
start
in
that
way
quite
right
and
proper
as
the
world
goes
but
it
sounds
odd
from
the
lips
of
one
of
your
mother's
girls
true
nevertheless
a
short
speech
but
the
quiet
decision
with
which
it
was
uttered
contrasted
curiously
with
the
young
speaker
laurie
felt
this
instinctively
and
laid
himself
down
again
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
which
he
could
not
explain
his
look
and
silence
as
well
as
a
certain
inward
self-disapproval
ruffled
amy
and
made
her
resolve
to
deliver
her
lecture
without
delay
i
wish
you'd
do
me
the
favor
to
rouse
yourself
a
little
she
said
sharply
do
it
for
me
there's
a
dear
girl
i
could
if
i
tried
and
she
looked
as
if
she
would
like
doing
it
in
the
most
summary
style
try
then
i
give
you
leave
returned
laurie
who
enjoyed
having
some
one
to
tease
after
his
long
abstinence
from
his
favorite
pastime
you'd
be
angry
in
five
minutes
i'm
never
angry
with
you
it
takes
two
flints
to
make
a
fire
you
are
as
cool
and
soft
as
snow
you
don't
know
what
i
can
do
snow
produces
a
glow
and
a
tingle
if
applied
rightly
your
indifference
is
half
affectation
and
a
good
stirring
up
would
prove
it
stir
away
it
won't
hurt
me
and
it
may
amuse
you
as
the
big
man
said
when
his
little
wife
beat
him
regard
me
in
the
light
of
a
husband
or
a
carpet
and
beat
till
you
are
tired
if
that
sort
of
exercise
agrees
with
you
being
decidedly
nettled
herself
and
longing
to
see
him
shake
off
the
apathy
that
so
altered
him
amy
sharpened
both
tongue
and
pencil
and
began:--
flo
and
i
have
got
a
new
name
for
you
it's
'lazy
laurence.'
how
do
you
like
it
she
thought
it
would
annoy
him
but
he
only
folded
his
arms
under
his
head
with
an
imperturbable
that's
not
bad
thank
you
ladies
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
honestly
think
of
you
pining
to
be
told
well
i
despise
you
if
she
had
even
said
i
hate
you
in
a
petulant
or
coquettish
tone
he
would
have
laughed
and
rather
liked
it
but
the
grave
almost
sad
accent
of
her
voice
made
him
open
his
eyes
and
ask
quickly,--
why
if
you
please
because
with
every
chance
for
being
good
useful
and
happy
you
are
faulty
lazy
and
miserable
strong
language
mademoiselle
if
you
like
it
i'll
go
on
pray
do
it's
quite
interesting
i
thought
you'd
find
it
so
selfish
people
always
like
to
talk
about
themselves
am
_i_
selfish
the
question
slipped
out
involuntarily
and
in
a
tone
of
surprise
for
the
one
virtue
on
which
he
prided
himself
was
generosity
yes
very
selfish
continued
amy
in
a
calm
cool
voice
twice
as
effective
just
then
as
an
angry
one
i'll
show
you
how
for
i've
studied
you
while
we
have
been
frolicking
and
i'm
not
at
all
satisfied
with
you
here
you
have
been
abroad
nearly
six
months
and
done
nothing
but
waste
time
and
money
and
disappoint
your
friends
isn't
a
fellow
to
have
any
pleasure
after
a
four-years
grind
you
don't
look
as
if
you'd
had
much
at
any
rate
you
are
none
the
better
for
it
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
said
when
we
first
met
that
you
had
improved
now
i
take
it
all
back
for
i
don't
think
you
half
so
nice
as
when
i
left
you
at
home
you
have
grown
abominably
lazy
you
like
gossip
and
waste
time
on
frivolous
things
you
are
contented
to
be
petted
and
admired
by
silly
people
instead
of
being
loved
and
respected
by
wise
ones
with
money
talent
position
health
and
beauty,--ah
you
like
that
old
vanity
but
it's
the
truth
so
i
can't
help
saying
it,--with
all
these
splendid
things
to
use
and
enjoy
you
can
find
nothing
to
do
but
dawdle
and
instead
of
being
the
man
you
might
and
ought
to
be
you
are
only--
there
she
stopped
with
a
look
that
had
both
pain
and
pity
in
it
saint
laurence
on
a
gridiron
added
laurie
blandly
finishing
the
sentence
but
the
lecture
began
to
take
effect
for
there
was
a
wide-awake
sparkle
in
his
eyes
now
and
a
half-angry
half-injured
expression
replaced
the
former
indifference
i
supposed
you'd
take
it
so
you
men
tell
us
we
are
angels
and
say
we
can
make
you
what
we
will
but
the
instant
we
honestly
try
to
do
you
good
you
laugh
at
us
and
won't
listen
which
proves
how
much
your
flattery
is
worth
amy
spoke
bitterly
and
turned
her
back
on
the
exasperating
martyr
at
her
feet
in
a
minute
a
hand
came
down
over
the
page
so
that
she
could
not
draw
and
laurie's
voice
said
with
a
droll
imitation
of
a
penitent
child,--
i
will
be
good
oh
i
will
be
good
but
amy
did
not
laugh
for
she
was
in
earnest
and
tapping
on
the
outspread
hand
with
her
pencil
said
soberly,--
aren't
you
ashamed
of
a
hand
like
that
it's
as
soft
and
white
as
a
woman's
and
looks
as
if
it
never
did
anything
but
wear
jouvin's
best
gloves
and
pick
flowers
for
ladies
you
are
not
a
dandy
thank
heaven
so
i'm
glad
to
see
there
are
no
diamonds
or
big
seal-rings
on
it
only
the
little
old
one
jo
gave
you
so
long
ago
dear
soul
i
wish
she
was
here
to
help
me
so
do
i
the
hand
vanished
as
suddenly
as
it
came
and
there
was
energy
enough
in
the
echo
of
her
wish
to
suit
even
amy
she
glanced
down
at
him
with
a
new
thought
in
her
mind
but
he
was
lying
with
his
hat
half
over
his
face
as
if
for
shade
and
his
mustache
hid
his
mouth
she
only
saw
his
chest
rise
and
fall
with
a
long
breath
that
might
have
been
a
sigh
and
the
hand
that
wore
the
ring
nestled
down
into
the
grass
as
if
to
hide
something
too
precious
or
too
tender
to
be
spoken
of
all
in
a
minute
various
hints
and
trifles
assumed
shape
and
significance
in
amy's
mind
and
told
her
what
her
sister
never
had
confided
to
her
she
remembered
that
laurie
never
spoke
voluntarily
of
jo
she
recalled
the
shadow
on
his
face
just
now
the
change
in
his
character
and
the
wearing
of
the
little
old
ring
which
was
no
ornament
to
a
handsome
hand
girls
are
quick
to
read
such
signs
and
feel
their
eloquence
amy
had
fancied
that
perhaps
a
love
trouble
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
alteration
and
now
she
was
sure
of
it
her
keen
eyes
filled
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
voice
that
could
be
beautifully
soft
and
kind
when
she
chose
to
make
it
so
i
know
i
have
no
right
to
talk
so
to
you
laurie
and
if
you
weren't
the
sweetest-tempered
fellow
in
the
world
you'd
be
very
angry
with
me
but
we
are
all
so
fond
and
proud
of
you
i
couldn't
bear
to
think
they
should
be
disappointed
in
you
at
home
as
i
have
been
though
perhaps
they
would
understand
the
change
better
than
i
do
i
think
they
would
came
from
under
the
hat
in
a
grim
tone
quite
as
touching
as
a
broken
one
they
ought
to
have
told
me
and
not
let
me
go
blundering
and
scolding
when
i
should
have
been
more
kind
and
patient
than
ever
i
never
did
like
that
miss
randal
and
now
i
hate
her
said
artful
amy
wishing
to
be
sure
of
her
facts
this
time
hang
miss
randal
and
laurie
knocked
the
hat
off
his
face
with
a
look
that
left
no
doubt
of
his
sentiments
toward
that
young
lady
i
beg
pardon
i
thought--
and
there
she
paused
diplomatically
no
you
didn't
you
knew
perfectly
well
i
never
cared
for
any
one
but
jo
laurie
said
that
in
his
old
impetuous
tone
and
turned
his
face
away
as
he
spoke
i
did
think
so
but
as
they
never
said
anything
about
it
and
you
came
away
i
supposed
i
was
mistaken
and
jo
wouldn't
be
kind
to
you
why
i
was
sure
she
loved
you
dearly
she
_was_
kind
but
not
in
the
right
way
and
it's
lucky
for
her
she
didn't
love
me
if
i'm
the
good-for-nothing
fellow
you
think
me
it's
her
fault
though
and
you
may
tell
her
so
the
hard
bitter
look
came
back
again
as
he
said
that
and
it
troubled
amy
for
she
did
not
know
what
balm
to
apply
i
was
wrong
i
didn't
know
i'm
very
sorry
i
was
so
cross
but
i
can't
help
wishing
you'd
bear
it
better
teddy
dear
don't
that's
her
name
for
me
and
laurie
put
up
his
hand
with
a
quick
gesture
to
stop
the
words
spoken
in
jo's
half-kind
half-reproachful
tone
wait
till
you've
tried
it
yourself
he
added
in
a
low
voice
as
he
pulled
up
the
grass
by
the
handful
i'd
take
it
manfully
and
be
respected
if
i
couldn't
be
loved
said
amy
with
the
decision
of
one
who
knew
nothing
about
it
now
laurie
flattered
himself
that
he
_had_
borne
it
remarkably
well
making
no
moan
asking
no
sympathy
and
taking
his
trouble
away
to
live
it
down
alone
amy's
lecture
put
the
matter
in
a
new
light
and
for
the
first
time
it
did
look
weak
and
selfish
to
lose
heart
at
the
first
failure
and
shut
himself
up
in
moody
indifference
he
felt
as
if
suddenly
shaken
out
of
a
pensive
dream
and
found
it
impossible
to
go
to
sleep
again
presently
he
sat
up
and
asked
slowly,--
do
you
think
jo
would
despise
me
as
you
do
yes
if
she
saw
you
now
she
hates
lazy
people
why
don't
you
do
something
splendid
and
_make_
her
love
you
i
did
my
best
but
it
was
no
use
graduating
well
you
mean
that
was
no
more
than
you
ought
to
have
done
for
your
grandfather's
sake
it
would
have
been
shameful
to
fail
after
spending
so
much
time
and
money
when
every
one
knew
you
_could_
do
well
i
did
fail
say
what
you
will
for
jo
wouldn't
love
me
began
laurie
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
in
a
despondent
attitude
no
you
didn't
and
you'll
say
so
in
the
end
for
it
did
you
good
and
proved
that
you
could
do
something
if
you
tried
if
you'd
only
set
about
another
task
of
some
sort
you'd
soon
be
your
hearty
happy
self
again
and
forget
your
trouble
that's
impossible
try
it
and
see
you
needn't
shrug
your
shoulders
and
think
'much
she
knows
about
such
things.'
i
don't
pretend
to
be
wise
but
i
_am_
observing
and
i
see
a
great
deal
more
than
you'd
imagine
i'm
interested
in
other
people's
experiences
and
inconsistencies
and
though
i
can't
explain
i
remember
and
use
them
for
my
own
benefit
love
jo
all
your
days
if
you
choose
but
don't
let
it
spoil
you
for
it's
wicked
to
throw
away
so
many
good
gifts
because
you
can't
have
the
one
you
want
there
i
won't
lecture
any
more
for
i
know
you'll
wake
up
and
be
a
man
in
spite
of
that
hardhearted
girl
neither
spoke
for
several
minutes
laurie
sat
turning
the
little
ring
on
his
finger
and
amy
put
the
last
touches
to
the
hasty
sketch
she
had
been
working
at
while
she
talked
presently
she
put
it
on
his
knee
merely
saying,--
how
do
you
like
that
he
looked
and
then
he
smiled
as
he
could
not
well
help
doing
for
it
was
capitally
done,--the
long
lazy
figure
on
the
grass
with
listless
face
half-shut
eyes
and
one
hand
holding
a
cigar
from
which
came
the
little
wreath
of
smoke
that
encircled
the
dreamer's
head
how
well
you
draw
he
said
with
genuine
surprise
and
pleasure
at
her
skill
adding
with
a
half-laugh,--
yes
that's
me
as
you
are
this
is
as
you
were
and
amy
laid
another
sketch
beside
the
one
he
held
it
was
not
nearly
so
well
done
but
there
was
a
life
and
spirit
in
it
which
atoned
for
many
faults
and
it
recalled
the
past
so
vividly
that
a
sudden
change
swept
over
the
young
man's
face
as
he
looked
only
a
rough
sketch
of
laurie
taming
a
horse
hat
and
coat
were
off
and
every
line
of
the
active
figure
resolute
face
and
commanding
attitude
was
full
of
energy
and
meaning
the
handsome
brute
just
subdued
stood
arching
his
neck
under
the
tightly
drawn
rein
with
one
foot
impatiently
pawing
the
ground
and
ears
pricked
up
as
if
listening
for
the
voice
that
had
mastered
him
in
the
ruffled
mane
the
rider's
breezy
hair
and
erect
attitude
there
was
a
suggestion
of
suddenly
arrested
motion
of
strength
courage
and
youthful
buoyancy
that
contrasted
sharply
with
the
supine
grace
of
the
_dolce
far
niente_
sketch
laurie
said
nothing
but
as
his
eye
went
from
one
to
the
other
amy
saw
him
flush
up
and
fold
his
lips
together
as
if
he
read
and
accepted
the
little
lesson
she
had
given
him
that
satisfied
her
and
without
waiting
for
him
to
speak
she
said
in
her
sprightly
way,--
illustration
a
rough
sketch
of
laurie
taming
a
horse
don't
you
remember
the
day
you
played
rarey
with
puck
and
we
all
looked
on
meg
and
beth
were
frightened
but
jo
clapped
and
pranced
and
i
sat
on
the
fence
and
drew
you
i
found
that
sketch
in
my
portfolio
the
other
day
touched
it
up
and
kept
it
to
show
you
much
obliged
you've
improved
immensely
since
then
and
i
congratulate
you
may
i
venture
to
suggest
in
'a
honeymoon
paradise'
that
five
o'clock
is
the
dinner-hour
at
your
hotel
laurie
rose
as
he
spoke
returned
the
pictures
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
and
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
to
remind
her
that
even
moral
lectures
should
have
an
end
he
tried
to
resume
his
former
easy
indifferent
air
but
it
_was_
an
affectation
now
for
the
rousing
had
been
more
efficacious
than
he
would
confess
amy
felt
the
shade
of
coldness
in
his
manner
and
said
to
herself,--
now
i've
offended
him
well
if
it
does
him
good
i'm
glad
if
it
makes
him
hate
me
i'm
sorry
but
it's
true
and
i
can't
take
back
a
word
of
it
they
laughed
and
chatted
all
the
way
home
and
little
baptiste
up
behind
thought
that
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
were
in
charming
spirits
but
both
felt
ill
at
ease
the
friendly
frankness
was
disturbed
the
sunshine
had
a
shadow
over
it
and
despite
their
apparent
gayety
there
was
a
secret
discontent
in
the
heart
of
each
shall
we
see
you
this
evening
_mon
frère_
asked
amy
as
they
parted
at
her
aunt's
door
unfortunately
i
have
an
engagement
_au
revoir
mademoiselle_
and
laurie
bent
as
if
to
kiss
her
hand
in
the
foreign
fashion
which
became
him
better
than
many
men
something
in
his
face
made
amy
say
quickly
and
warmly,--
no
be
yourself
with
me
laurie
and
part
in
the
good
old
way
i'd
rather
have
a
hearty
english
hand-shake
than
all
the
sentimental
salutations
in
france
good-by
dear
and
with
these
words
uttered
in
the
tone
she
liked
laurie
left
her
after
a
hand-shake
almost
painful
in
its
heartiness
next
morning
instead
of
the
usual
call
amy
received
a
note
which
made
her
smile
at
the
beginning
and
sigh
at
the
end:--
my
dear
mentor,--
please
make
my
adieux
to
your
aunt
and
exult
within
yourself
for
'lazy
laurence'

grandpa

the
best
of
boys

pleasant
winter
to
you
and

the
gods
grant

a
blissful
honeymoon

benefited

a
rouser

with
my
congratulations
yours
gratefully
telemachus
good
boy
i'm
glad
he's
gone
said
amy
with
an
approving
smile
the
next
minute
her
face
fell
as
she
glanced
about
the
empty
room
adding
with
an
involuntary
sigh,--
yes
i
_am_
glad
but
how
i
shall
miss
him
illustration
the
valley
of
the
shadow
xl
the
valley
of
the
shadow
when
the
first
bitterness
was
over
the
family
accepted
the
inevitable
and
tried
to
bear
it
cheerfully
helping
one
another
by
the
increased
affection
which
comes
to
bind
households
tenderly
together
in
times
of
trouble
they
put
away
their
grief
and
each
did
his
or
her
part
toward
making
that
last
year
a
happy
one
the
pleasantest
room
in
the
house
was
set
apart
for
beth
and
in
it
was
gathered
everything
that
she
most
loved,--flowers
pictures
her
piano
the
little
work-table
and
the
beloved
pussies
father's
best
books
found
their
way
there
mother's
easy-chair
jo's
desk
amy's
finest
sketches
and
every
day
meg
brought
her
babies
on
a
loving
pilgrimage
to
make
sunshine
for
aunty
beth
john
quietly
set
apart
a
little
sum
that
he
might
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
keeping
the
invalid
supplied
with
the
fruit
she
loved
and
longed
for
old
hannah
never
wearied
of
concocting
dainty
dishes
to
tempt
a
capricious
appetite
dropping
tears
as
she
worked
and
from
across
the
sea
came
little
gifts
and
cheerful
letters
seeming
to
bring
breaths
of
warmth
and
fragrance
from
lands
that
know
no
winter
here
cherished
like
a
household
saint
in
its
shrine
sat
beth
tranquil
and
busy
as
ever
for
nothing
could
change
the
sweet
unselfish
nature
and
even
while
preparing
to
leave
life
she
tried
to
make
it
happier
for
those
who
should
remain
behind
the
feeble
fingers
were
never
idle
and
one
of
her
pleasures
was
to
make
little
things
for
the
school-children
daily
passing
to
and
fro,--to
drop
a
pair
of
mittens
from
her
window
for
a
pair
of
purple
hands
a
needle-book
for
some
small
mother
of
many
dolls
pen-wipers
for
young
penmen
toiling
through
forests
of
pot-hooks
scrap-books
for
picture-loving
eyes
and
all
manner
of
pleasant
devices
till
the
reluctant
climbers
up
the
ladder
of
learning
found
their
way
strewn
with
flowers
as
it
were
and
came
to
regard
the
gentle
giver
as
a
sort
of
fairy
godmother
who
sat
above
there
and
showered
down
gifts
miraculously
suited
to
their
tastes
and
needs
if
beth
had
wanted
any
reward
she
found
it
in
the
bright
little
faces
always
turned
up
to
her
window
with
nods
and
smiles
and
the
droll
little
letters
which
came
to
her
full
of
blots
and
gratitude
the
first
few
months
were
very
happy
ones
and
beth
often
used
to
look
round
and
say
how
beautiful
this
is
as
they
all
sat
together
in
her
sunny
room
the
babies
kicking
and
crowing
on
the
floor
mother
and
sisters
working
near
and
father
reading
in
his
pleasant
voice
from
the
wise
old
books
which
seemed
rich
in
good
and
comfortable
words
as
applicable
now
as
when
written
centuries
ago
a
little
chapel
where
a
paternal
priest
taught
his
flock
the
hard
lessons
all
must
learn
trying
to
show
them
that
hope
can
comfort
love
and
faith
make
resignation
possible
simple
sermons
that
went
straight
to
the
souls
of
those
who
listened
for
the
father's
heart
was
in
the
minister's
religion
and
the
frequent
falter
in
the
voice
gave
a
double
eloquence
to
the
words
he
spoke
or
read
it
was
well
for
all
that
this
peaceful
time
was
given
them
as
preparation
for
the
sad
hours
to
come
for
by
and
by
beth
said
the
needle
was
so
heavy
and
put
it
down
forever
talking
wearied
her
faces
troubled
her
pain
claimed
her
for
its
own
and
her
tranquil
spirit
was
sorrowfully
perturbed
by
the
ills
that
vexed
her
feeble
flesh
ah
me
such
heavy
days
such
long
long
nights
such
aching
hearts
and
imploring
prayers
when
those
who
loved
her
best
were
forced
to
see
the
thin
hands
stretched
out
to
them
beseechingly
to
hear
the
bitter
cry
help
me
help
me
and
to
feel
that
there
was
no
help
a
sad
eclipse
of
the
serene
soul
a
sharp
struggle
of
the
young
life
with
death
but
both
were
mercifully
brief
and
then
the
natural
rebellion
over
the
old
peace
returned
more
beautiful
than
ever
with
the
wreck
of
her
frail
body
beth's
soul
grew
strong
and
though
she
said
little
those
about
her
felt
that
she
was
ready
saw
that
the
first
pilgrim
called
was
likewise
the
fittest
and
waited
with
her
on
the
shore
trying
to
see
the
shining
ones
coming
to
receive
her
when
she
crossed
the
river
jo
never
left
her
for
an
hour
since
beth
had
said
i
feel
stronger
when
you
are
here
she
slept
on
a
couch
in
the
room
waking
often
to
renew
the
fire
to
feed
lift
or
wait
upon
the
patient
creature
who
seldom
asked
for
anything
and
tried
not
to
be
a
trouble
all
day
she
haunted
the
room
jealous
of
any
other
nurse
and
prouder
of
being
chosen
then
than
of
any
honor
her
life
ever
brought
her
precious
and
helpful
hours
to
jo
for
now
her
heart
received
the
teaching
that
it
needed
lessons
in
patience
were
so
sweetly
taught
her
that
she
could
not
fail
to
learn
them
charity
for
all
the
lovely
spirit
that
can
forgive
and
truly
forget
unkindness
the
loyalty
to
duty
that
makes
the
hardest
easy
and
the
sincere
faith
that
fears
nothing
but
trusts
undoubtingly
often
when
she
woke
jo
found
beth
reading
in
her
well-worn
little
book
heard
her
singing
softly
to
beguile
the
sleepless
night
or
saw
her
lean
her
face
upon
her
hands
while
slow
tears
dropped
through
the
transparent
fingers
and
jo
would
lie
watching
her
with
thoughts
too
deep
for
tears
feeling
that
beth
in
her
simple
unselfish
way
was
trying
to
wean
herself
from
the
dear
old
life
and
fit
herself
for
the
life
to
come
by
sacred
words
of
comfort
quiet
prayers
and
the
music
she
loved
so
well
seeing
this
did
more
for
jo
than
the
wisest
sermons
the
saintliest
hymns
the
most
fervent
prayers
that
any
voice
could
utter
for
with
eyes
made
clear
by
many
tears
and
a
heart
softened
by
the
tenderest
sorrow
she
recognized
the
beauty
of
her
sister's
life,--uneventful
unambitious
yet
full
of
the
genuine
virtues
which
smell
sweet
and
blossom
in
the
dust
the
self-forgetfulness
that
makes
the
humblest
on
earth
remembered
soonest
in
heaven
the
true
success
which
is
possible
to
all
one
night
when
beth
looked
among
the
books
upon
her
table
to
find
something
to
make
her
forget
the
mortal
weariness
that
was
almost
as
hard
to
bear
as
pain
as
she
turned
the
leaves
of
her
old
favorite
pilgrim's
progress
she
found
a
little
paper
scribbled
over
in
jo's
hand
the
name
caught
her
eye
and
the
blurred
look
of
the
lines
made
her
sure
that
tears
had
fallen
on
it
poor
jo
she's
fast
asleep
so
i
won't
wake
her
to
ask
leave
she
shows
me
all
her
things
and
i
don't
think
she'll
mind
if
i
look
at
this
thought
beth
with
a
glance
at
her
sister
who
lay
on
the
rug
with
the
tongs
beside
her
ready
to
wake
up
the
minute
the
log
fell
apart
my
beth
sitting
patient
in
the
shadow
till
the
blessed
light
shall
come
a
serene
and
saintly
presence
sanctifies
our
troubled
home
earthly
joys
and
hopes
and
sorrows
break
like
ripples
on
the
strand
of
the
deep
and
solemn
river
where
her
willing
feet
now
stand
o
my
sister
passing
from
me
out
of
human
care
and
strife
leave
me
as
a
gift
those
virtues
which
have
beautified
your
life
dear
bequeath
me
that
great
patience
which
has
power
to
sustain
a
cheerful
uncomplaining
spirit
in
its
prison-house
of
pain
give
me
for
i
need
it
sorely
of
that
courage
wise
and
sweet
which
has
made
the
path
of
duty
green
beneath
your
willing
feet
give
me
that
unselfish
nature
that
with
charity
divine
can
pardon
wrong
for
love's
dear
sake--
meek
heart
forgive
me
mine
thus
our
parting
daily
loseth
something
of
its
bitter
pain
and
while
learning
this
hard
lesson
my
great
loss
becomes
my
gain
for
the
touch
of
grief
will
render
my
wild
nature
more
serene
give
to
life
new
aspirations
a
new
trust
in
the
unseen
henceforth
safe
across
the
river
i
shall
see
forevermore
a
beloved
household
spirit
waiting
for
me
on
the
shore
hope
and
faith
born
of
my
sorrow
guardian
angels
shall
become
and
the
sister
gone
before
me
by
their
hands
shall
lead
me
home
blurred
and
blotted
faulty
and
feeble
as
the
lines
were
they
brought
a
look
of
inexpressible
comfort
to
beth's
face
for
her
one
regret
had
been
that
she
had
done
so
little
and
this
seemed
to
assure
her
that
her
life
had
not
been
useless
that
her
death
would
not
bring
the
despair
she
feared
as
she
sat
with
the
paper
folded
between
her
hands
the
charred
log
fell
asunder
jo
started
up
revived
the
blaze
and
crept
to
the
bedside
hoping
beth
slept
not
asleep
but
so
happy
dear
see
i
found
this
and
read
it
i
knew
you
wouldn't
care
have
i
been
all
that
to
you
jo
she
asked
with
wistful
humble
earnestness
o
beth
so
much
so
much
and
jo's
head
went
down
upon
the
pillow
beside
her
sister's
then
i
don't
feel
as
if
i'd
wasted
my
life
i'm
not
so
good
as
you
make
me
but
i
_have_
tried
to
do
right
and
now
when
it's
too
late
to
begin
even
to
do
better
it's
such
a
comfort
to
know
that
some
one
loves
me
so
much
and
feels
as
if
i'd
helped
them
more
than
any
one
in
the
world
beth
i
used
to
think
i
couldn't
let
you
go
but
i'm
learning
to
feel
that
i
don't
lose
you
that
you'll
be
more
to
me
than
ever
and
death
can't
part
us
though
it
seems
to
i
know
it
cannot
and
i
don't
fear
it
any
longer
for
i'm
sure
i
shall
be
your
beth
still
to
love
and
help
you
more
than
ever
you
must
take
my
place
jo
and
be
everything
to
father
and
mother
when
i'm
gone
they
will
turn
to
you
don't
fail
them
and
if
it's
hard
to
work
alone
remember
that
i
don't
forget
you
and
that
you'll
be
happier
in
doing
that
than
writing
splendid
books
or
seeing
all
the
world
for
love
is
the
only
thing
that
we
can
carry
with
us
when
we
go
and
it
makes
the
end
so
easy
i'll
try
beth
and
then
and
there
jo
renounced
her
old
ambition
pledged
herself
to
a
new
and
better
one
acknowledging
the
poverty
of
other
desires
and
feeling
the
blessed
solace
of
a
belief
in
the
immortality
of
love
so
the
spring
days
came
and
went
the
sky
grew
clearer
the
earth
greener
the
flowers
were
up
fair
and
early
and
the
birds
came
back
in
time
to
say
good-by
to
beth
who
like
a
tired
but
trustful
child
clung
to
the
hands
that
had
led
her
all
her
life
as
father
and
mother
guided
her
tenderly
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
gave
her
up
to
god
seldom
except
in
books
do
the
dying
utter
memorable
words
see
visions
or
depart
with
beatified
countenances
and
those
who
have
sped
many
parting
souls
know
that
to
most
the
end
comes
as
naturally
and
simply
as
sleep
as
beth
had
hoped
the
tide
went
out
easily
and
in
the
dark
hour
before
the
dawn
on
the
bosom
where
she
had
drawn
her
first
breath
she
quietly
drew
her
last
with
no
farewell
but
one
loving
look
one
little
sigh
with
tears
and
prayers
and
tender
hands
mother
and
sisters
made
her
ready
for
the
long
sleep
that
pain
would
never
mar
again
seeing
with
grateful
eyes
the
beautiful
serenity
that
soon
replaced
the
pathetic
patience
that
had
wrung
their
hearts
so
long
and
feeling
with
reverent
joy
that
to
their
darling
death
was
a
benignant
angel
not
a
phantom
full
of
dread
when
morning
came
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
the
fire
was
out
jo's
place
was
empty
and
the
room
was
very
still
but
a
bird
sang
blithely
on
a
budding
bough
close
by
the
snow-drops
blossomed
freshly
at
the
window
and
the
spring
sunshine
streamed
in
like
a
benediction
over
the
placid
face
upon
the
pillow,--a
face
so
full
of
painless
peace
that
those
who
loved
it
best
smiled
through
their
tears
and
thanked
god
that
beth
was
well

learning
to
forget
amy's
lecture
did

good
though
of
course
he
did
not
own
it
till
long
afterward
men
seldom
do
for
when
women
are
the
advisers
the
lords
of
creation
don't
take
the
advice
till
they
have
persuaded
themselves
that
it
is
just
what
they
intended
to
do

they
act
upon
it
and
if
it
succeeds

went
back
to
his
grandfather
and
was
so
dutifully
devoted
for
several
weeks
that
the
old
gentleman
declared
the
climate
of
nice
had
improved
him
wonderfully
and
he
had
better
try
it
again
there
was
nothing
the
young
gentleman
would
have
liked
better
but
elephants
could
not
have
dragged
him
back
after
the
scolding
he
had
received
pride

and
whenever
the
longing
grew
very
strong
he
fortified
his
resolution
by
repeating
the
words
that
had
made
the
deepest
impression
i
despise
you
go
and
do
something
splendid
that
will
_make_
her
love
you
laurie
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
so
often
that
he
soon
brought
himself
to
confess
that
he
_had_
been
selfish
and
lazy
but
then
when
a
man
has
a
great
sorrow
he
should
be
indulged
in
all
sorts
of
vagaries
till
he
has
lived
it
down
he
felt
that
his
blighted
affections
were
quite
dead
now
and
though
he
should
never
cease
to
be
a
faithful
mourner
there
was
no
occasion
to
wear
his
weeds
ostentatiously
jo
_wouldn't_
love
him
but
he
might
_make_
her
respect
and
admire
him
by
doing
something
which
should
prove
that
a
girl's
no
had
not
spoilt
his
life
he
had
always
meant
to
do
something
and
amy's
advice
was
quite
unnecessary
he
had
only
been
waiting
till
the
aforesaid
blighted
affections
were
decently
interred
that
being
done
he
felt
that
he
was
ready
to
hide
his
stricken
heart
and
still
toil
on
as
goethe
when
he
had
a
joy
or
a
grief
put
it
into
a
song
so
laurie
resolved
to
embalm
his
love-sorrow
in
music
and
compose
a
requiem
which
should
harrow
up
jo's
soul
and
melt
the
heart
of
every
hearer
therefore
the
next
time
the
old
gentleman
found
him
getting
restless
and
moody
and
ordered
him
off
he
went
to
vienna
where
he
had
musical
friends
and
fell
to
work
with
the
firm
determination
to
distinguish
himself
but
whether
the
sorrow
was
too
vast
to
be
embodied
in
music
or
music
too
ethereal
to
uplift
a
mortal
woe
he
soon
discovered
that
the
requiem
was
beyond
him
just
at
present
it
was
evident
that
his
mind
was
not
in
working
order
yet
and
his
ideas
needed
clarifying
for
often
in
the
middle
of
a
plaintive
strain
he
would
find
himself
humming
a
dancing
tune
that
vividly
recalled
the
christmas
ball
at
nice
especially
the
stout
frenchman
and
put
an
effectual
stop
to
tragic
composition
for
the
time
being
then
he
tried
an
opera
for
nothing
seemed
impossible
in
the
beginning
but
here
again
unforeseen
difficulties
beset
him
he
wanted
jo
for
his
heroine
and
called
upon
his
memory
to
supply
him
with
tender
recollections
and
romantic
visions
of
his
love
but
memory
turned
traitor
and
as
if
possessed
by
the
perverse
spirit
of
the
girl
would
only
recall
jo's
oddities
faults
and
freaks
would
only
show
her
in
the
most
unsentimental
aspects,--beating
mats
with
her
head
tied
up
in
a
bandanna
barricading
herself
with
the
sofa-pillow
or
throwing
cold
water
over
his
passion
_à
la_
gummidge,--and
an
irresistible
laugh
spoilt
the
pensive
picture
he
was
endeavoring
to
paint
jo
wouldn't
be
put
into
the
opera
at
any
price
and
he
had
to
give
her
up
with
a
bless
that
girl
what
a
torment
she
is
and
a
clutch
at
his
hair
as
became
a
distracted
composer
when
he
looked
about
him
for
another
and
a
less
intractable
damsel
to
immortalize
in
melody
memory
produced
one
with
the
most
obliging
readiness
this
phantom
wore
many
faces
but
it
always
had
golden
hair
was
enveloped
in
a
diaphanous
cloud
and
floated
airily
before
his
mind's
eye
in
a
pleasing
chaos
of
roses
peacocks
white
ponies
and
blue
ribbons
he
did
not
give
the
complacent
wraith
any
name
but
he
took
her
for
his
heroine
and
grew
quite
fond
of
her
as
well
he
might
for
he
gifted
her
with
every
gift
and
grace
under
the
sun
and
escorted
her
unscathed
through
trials
which
would
have
annihilated
any
mortal
woman
thanks
to
this
inspiration
he
got
on
swimmingly
for
a
time
but
gradually
the
work
lost
its
charm
and
he
forgot
to
compose
while
he
sat
musing
pen
in
hand
or
roamed
about
the
gay
city
to
get
new
ideas
and
refresh
his
mind
which
seemed
to
be
in
a
somewhat
unsettled
state
that
winter
he
did
not
do
much
but
he
thought
a
great
deal
and
was
conscious
of
a
change
of
some
sort
going
on
in
spite
of
himself
it's
genius
simmering
perhaps
i'll
let
it
simmer
and
see
what
comes
of
it
he
said
with
a
secret
suspicion
all
the
while
that
it
wasn't
genius
but
something
far
more
common
whatever
it
was
it
simmered
to
some
purpose
for
he
grew
more
and
more
discontented
with
his
desultory
life
began
to
long
for
some
real
and
earnest
work
to
go
at
soul
and
body
and
finally
came
to
the
wise
conclusion
that
every
one
who
loved
music
was
not
a
composer
returning
from
one
of
mozart's
grand
operas
splendidly
performed
at
the
royal
theatre
he
looked
over
his
own
played
a
few
of
the
best
parts
sat
staring
up
at
the
busts
of
mendelssohn
beethoven
and
bach
who
stared
benignly
back
again
then
suddenly
he
tore
up
his
music-sheets
one
by
one
and
as
the
last
fluttered
out
of
his
hand
he
said
soberly
to
himself,--
she
is
right
talent
isn't
genius
and
you
can't
make
it
so
that
music
has
taken
the
vanity
out
of
me
as
rome
took
it
out
of
her
and
i
won't
be
a
humbug
any
longer
now
what
shall
i
do
that
seemed
a
hard
question
to
answer
and
laurie
began
to
wish
he
had
to
work
for
his
daily
bread
now
if
ever
occurred
an
eligible
opportunity
for
going
to
the
devil
as
he
once
forcibly
expressed
it
for
he
had
plenty
of
money
and
nothing
to
do
and
satan
is
proverbially
fond
of
providing
employment
for
full
and
idle
hands
the
poor
fellow
had
temptations
enough
from
without
and
from
within
but
he
withstood
them
pretty
well
for
much
as
he
valued
liberty
he
valued
good
faith
and
confidence
more
so
his
promise
to
his
grandfather
and
his
desire
to
be
able
to
look
honestly
into
the
eyes
of
the
women
who
loved
him
and
say
all's
well
kept
him
safe
and
steady
very
likely
some
mrs
grundy
will
observe
i
don't
believe
it
boys
will
be
boys
young
men
must
sow
their
wild
oats
and
women
must
not
expect
miracles
i
dare
say
_you_
don't
mrs
grundy
but
it's
true
nevertheless
women
work
a
good
many
miracles
and
i
have
a
persuasion
that
they
may
perform
even
that
of
raising
the
standard
of
manhood
by
refusing
to
echo
such
sayings
let
the
boys
be
boys
the
longer
the
better
and
let
the
young
men
sow
their
wild
oats
if
they
must
but
mothers
sisters
and
friends
may
help
to
make
the
crop
a
small
one
and
keep
many
tares
from
spoiling
the
harvest
by
believing
and
showing
that
they
believe
in
the
possibility
of
loyalty
to
the
virtues
which
make
men
manliest
in
good
women's
eyes
if
it
_is_
a
feminine
delusion
leave
us
to
enjoy
it
while
we
may
for
without
it
half
the
beauty
and
the
romance
of
life
is
lost
and
sorrowful
forebodings
would
embitter
all
our
hopes
of
the
brave
tender-hearted
little
lads
who
still
love
their
mothers
better
than
themselves
and
are
not
ashamed
to
own
it
laurie
thought
that
the
task
of
forgetting
his
love
for
jo
would
absorb
all
his
powers
for
years
but
to
his
great
surprise
he
discovered
it
grew
easier
every
day
he
refused
to
believe
it
at
first
got
angry
with
himself
and
couldn't
understand
it
but
these
hearts
of
ours
are
curious
and
contrary
things
and
time
and
nature
work
their
will
in
spite
of
us
laurie's
heart
_wouldn't_
ache
the
wound
persisted
in
healing
with
a
rapidity
that
astonished
him
and
instead
of
trying
to
forget
he
found
himself
trying
to
remember
he
had
not
foreseen
this
turn
of
affairs
and
was
not
prepared
for
it
he
was
disgusted
with
himself
surprised
at
his
own
fickleness
and
full
of
a
queer
mixture
of
disappointment
and
relief
that
he
could
recover
from
such
a
tremendous
blow
so
soon
he
carefully
stirred
up
the
embers
of
his
lost
love
but
they
refused
to
burst
into
a
blaze
there
was
only
a
comfortable
glow
that
warmed
and
did
him
good
without
putting
him
into
a
fever
and
he
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
confess
that
the
boyish
passion
was
slowly
subsiding
into
a
more
tranquil
sentiment
very
tender
a
little
sad
and
resentful
still
but
that
was
sure
to
pass
away
in
time
leaving
a
brotherly
affection
which
would
last
unbroken
to
the
end
as
the
word
brotherly
passed
through
his
mind
in
one
of
these
reveries
he
smiled
and
glanced
up
at
the
picture
of
mozart
that
was
before
him:--
well
he
was
a
great
man
and
when
he
couldn't
have
one
sister
he
took
the
other
and
was
happy
laurie
did
not
utter
the
words
but
he
thought
them
and
the
next
instant
kissed
the
little
old
ring
saying
to
himself,--
no
i
won't
i
haven't
forgotten
i
never
can
i'll
try
again
and
if
that
fails
why
then--
leaving
his
sentence
unfinished
he
seized
pen
and
paper
and
wrote
to
jo
telling
her
that
he
could
not
settle
to
anything
while
there
was
the
least
hope
of
her
changing
her
mind
couldn't
she
wouldn't
she
and
let
him
come
home
and
be
happy
while
waiting
for
an
answer
he
did
nothing
but
he
did
it
energetically
for
he
was
in
a
fever
of
impatience
it
came
at
last
and
settled
his
mind
effectually
on
one
point
for
jo
decidedly
couldn't
and
wouldn't
she
was
wrapped
up
in
beth
and
never
wished
to
hear
the
word
love
again
then
she
begged
him
to
be
happy
with
somebody
else
but
always
to
keep
a
little
corner
of
his
heart
for
his
loving
sister
jo
in
a
postscript
she
desired
him
not
to
tell
amy
that
beth
was
worse
she
was
coming
home
in
the
spring
and
there
was
no
need
of
saddening
the
remainder
of
her
stay
that
would
be
time
enough
please
god
but
laurie
must
write
to
her
often
and
not
let
her
feel
lonely
homesick
or
anxious
so
i
will
at
once
poor
little
girl
it
will
be
a
sad
going
home
for
her
i'm
afraid
and
laurie
opened
his
desk
as
if
writing
to
amy
had
been
the
proper
conclusion
of
the
sentence
left
unfinished
some
weeks
before
but
he
did
not
write
the
letter
that
day
for
as
he
rummaged
out
his
best
paper
he
came
across
something
which
changed
his
purpose
tumbling
about
in
one
part
of
the
desk
among
bills
passports
and
business
documents
of
various
kinds
were
several
of
jo's
letters
and
in
another
compartment
were
three
notes
from
amy
carefully
tied
up
with
one
of
her
blue
ribbons
and
sweetly
suggestive
of
the
little
dead
roses
put
away
inside
with
a
half-repentant
half-amused
expression
laurie
gathered
up
all
jo's
letters
smoothed
folded
and
put
them
neatly
into
a
small
drawer
of
the
desk
stood
a
minute
turning
the
ring
thoughtfully
on
his
finger
then
slowly
drew
it
off
laid
it
with
the
letters
locked
the
drawer
and
went
out
to
hear
high
mass
at
saint
stefan's
feeling
as
if
there
had
been
a
funeral
and
though
not
overwhelmed
with
affliction
this
seemed
a
more
proper
way
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
than
in
writing
letters
to
charming
young
ladies
illustration
turning
the
ring
thoughtfully
upon
his
finger
the
letter
went
very
soon
however
and
was
promptly
answered
for
amy
_was_
homesick
and
confessed
it
in
the
most
delightfully
confiding
manner
the
correspondence
flourished
famously
and
letters
flew
to
and
fro
with
unfailing
regularity
all
through
the
early
spring
laurie
sold
his
busts
made
allumettes
of
his
opera
and
went
back
to
paris
hoping
somebody
would
arrive
before
long
he
wanted
desperately
to
go
to
nice
but
would
not
till
he
was
asked
and
amy
would
not
ask
him
for
just
then
she
was
having
little
experiences
of
her
own
which
made
her
rather
wish
to
avoid
the
quizzical
eyes
of
our
boy
fred
vaughn
had
returned
and
put
the
question
to
which
she
had
once
decided
to
answer
yes
thank
you
but
now
she
said
no
thank
you
kindly
but
steadily
for
when
the
time
came
her
courage
failed
her
and
she
found
that
something
more
than
money
and
position
was
needed
to
satisfy
the
new
longing
that
filled
her
heart
so
full
of
tender
hopes
and
fears
the
words
fred
is
a
good
fellow
but
not
at
all
the
man
i
fancied
you
would
ever
like
and
laurie's
face
when
he
uttered
them
kept
returning
to
her
as
pertinaciously
as
her
own
did
when
she
said
in
look
if
not
in
words
i
shall
marry
for
money
it
troubled
her
to
remember
that
now
she
wished
she
could
take
it
back
it
sounded
so
unwomanly
she
didn't
want
laurie
to
think
her
a
heartless
worldly
creature
she
didn't
care
to
be
a
queen
of
society
now
half
so
much
as
she
did
to
be
a
lovable
woman
she
was
so
glad
he
didn't
hate
her
for
the
dreadful
things
she
said
but
took
them
so
beautifully
and
was
kinder
than
ever
his
letters
were
such
a
comfort
for
the
home
letters
were
very
irregular
and
were
not
half
so
satisfactory
as
his
when
they
did
come
it
was
not
only
a
pleasure
but
a
duty
to
answer
them
for
the
poor
fellow
was
forlorn
and
needed
petting
since
jo
persisted
in
being
stony-hearted
she
ought
to
have
made
an
effort
and
tried
to
love
him
it
couldn't
be
very
hard
many
people
would
be
proud
and
glad
to
have
such
a
dear
boy
care
for
them
but
jo
never
would
act
like
other
girls
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
be
very
kind
and
treat
him
like
a
brother
if
all
brothers
were
treated
as
well
as
laurie
was
at
this
period
they
would
be
a
much
happier
race
of
beings
than
they
are
amy
never
lectured
now
she
asked
his
opinion
on
all
subjects
she
was
interested
in
everything
he
did
made
charming
little
presents
for
him
and
sent
him
two
letters
a
week
full
of
lively
gossip
sisterly
confidences
and
captivating
sketches
of
the
lovely
scenes
about
her
as
few
brothers
are
complimented
by
having
their
letters
carried
about
in
their
sisters'
pockets
read
and
reread
diligently
cried
over
when
short
kissed
when
long
and
treasured
carefully
we
will
not
hint
that
amy
did
any
of
these
fond
and
foolish
things
but
she
certainly
did
grow
a
little
pale
and
pensive
that
spring
lost
much
of
her
relish
for
society
and
went
out
sketching
alone
a
good
deal
she
never
had
much
to
show
when
she
came
home
but
was
studying
nature
i
dare
say
while
she
sat
for
hours
with
her
hands
folded
on
the
terrace
at
valrosa
or
absently
sketched
any
fancy
that
occurred
to
her,--a
stalwart
knight
carved
on
a
tomb
a
young
man
asleep
in
the
grass
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
or
a
curly-haired
girl
in
gorgeous
array
promenading
down
a
ball-room
on
the
arm
of
a
tall
gentleman
both
faces
being
left
a
blur
according
to
the
last
fashion
in
art
which
was
safe
but
not
altogether
satisfactory
her
aunt
thought
that
she
regretted
her
answer
to
fred
and
finding
denials
useless
and
explanations
impossible
amy
left
her
to
think
what
she
liked
taking
care
that
laurie
should
know
that
fred
had
gone
to
egypt
that
was
all
but
he
understood
it
and
looked
relieved
as
he
said
to
himself
with
a
venerable
air,--
i
was
sure
she
would
think
better
of
it
poor
old
fellow
i've
been
through
it
all
and
i
can
sympathize
with
that
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
and
then
as
if
he
had
discharged
his
duty
to
the
past
put
his
feet
up
on
the
sofa
and
enjoyed
amy's
letter
luxuriously
while
these
changes
were
going
on
abroad
trouble
had
come
at
home
but
the
letter
telling
that
beth
was
failing
never
reached
amy
and
when
the
next
found
her
the
grass
was
green
above
her
sister
the
sad
news
met
her
at
vevay
for
the
heat
had
driven
them
from
nice
in
may
and
they
had
travelled
slowly
to
switzerland
by
way
of
genoa
and
the
italian
lakes
she
bore
it
very
well
and
quietly
submitted
to
the
family
decree
that
she
should
not
shorten
her
visit
for
since
it
was
too
late
to
say
good-by
to
beth
she
had
better
stay
and
let
absence
soften
her
sorrow
but
her
heart
was
very
heavy
she
longed
to
be
at
home
and
every
day
looked
wistfully
across
the
lake
waiting
for
laurie
to
come
and
comfort
her
he
did
come
very
soon
for
the
same
mail
brought
letters
to
them
both
but
he
was
in
germany
and
it
took
some
days
to
reach
him
the
moment
he
read
it
he
packed
his
knapsack
bade
adieu
to
his
fellow-pedestrians
and
was
off
to
keep
his
promise
with
a
heart
full
of
joy
and
sorrow
hope
and
suspense
he
knew
vevay
well
and
as
soon
as
the
boat
touched
the
little
quay
he
hurried
along
the
shore
to
la
tour
where
the
carrols
were
living
_en
pension_
the
_garçon_
was
in
despair
that
the
whole
family
had
gone
to
take
a
promenade
on
the
lake
but
no
the
blond
mademoiselle
might
be
in
the
chateau
garden
if
monsieur
would
give
himself
the
pain
of
sitting
down
a
flash
of
time
should
present
her
but
monsieur
could
not
wait
even
a
flash
of
time
and
in
the
middle
of
the
speech
departed
to
find
mademoiselle
himself
a
pleasant
old
garden
on
the
borders
of
the
lovely
lake
with
chestnuts
rustling
overhead
ivy
climbing
everywhere
and
the
black
shadow
of
the
tower
falling
far
across
the
sunny
water
at
one
corner
of
the
wide
low
wall
was
a
seat
and
here
amy
often
came
to
read
or
work
or
console
herself
with
the
beauty
all
about
her
she
was
sitting
here
that
day
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
with
a
homesick
heart
and
heavy
eyes
thinking
of
beth
and
wondering
why
laurie
did
not
come
she
did
not
hear
him
cross
the
court-yard
beyond
nor
see
him
pause
in
the
archway
that
led
from
the
subterranean
path
into
the
garden
he
stood
a
minute
looking
at
her
with
new
eyes
seeing
what
no
one
had
ever
seen
before,--the
tender
side
of
amy's
character
everything
about
her
mutely
suggested
love
and
sorrow,--the
blotted
letters
in
her
lap
the
black
ribbon
that
tied
up
her
hair
the
womanly
pain
and
patience
in
her
face
even
the
little
ebony
cross
at
her
throat
seemed
pathetic
to
laurie
for
he
had
given
it
to
her
and
she
wore
it
as
her
only
ornament
if
he
had
any
doubts
about
the
reception
she
would
give
him
they
were
set
at
rest
the
minute
she
looked
up
and
saw
him
for
dropping
everything
she
ran
to
him
exclaiming
in
a
tone
of
unmistakable
love
and
longing,--
o
laurie
laurie
i
knew
you'd
come
to
me
illustration
o
laurie
laurie
i
knew
you'd
come
i
think
everything
was
said
and
settled
then
for
as
they
stood
together
quite
silent
for
a
moment
with
the
dark
head
bent
down
protectingly
over
the
light
one
amy
felt
that
no
one
could
comfort
and
sustain
her
so
well
as
laurie
and
laurie
decided
that
amy
was
the
only
woman
in
the
world
who
could
fill
jo's
place
and
make
him
happy
he
did
not
tell
her
so
but
she
was
not
disappointed
for
both
felt
the
truth
were
satisfied
and
gladly
left
the
rest
to
silence
in
a
minute
amy
went
back
to
her
place
and
while
she
dried
her
tears
laurie
gathered
up
the
scattered
papers
finding
in
the
sight
of
sundry
well-worn
letters
and
suggestive
sketches
good
omens
for
the
future
as
he
sat
down
beside
her
amy
felt
shy
again
and
turned
rosy
red
at
the
recollection
of
her
impulsive
greeting
i
couldn't
help
it
i
felt
so
lonely
and
sad
and
was
so
very
glad
to
see
you
it
was
such
a
surprise
to
look
up
and
find
you
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
fear
you
wouldn't
come
she
said
trying
in
vain
to
speak
quite
naturally
i
came
the
minute
i
heard
i
wish
i
could
say
something
to
comfort
you
for
the
loss
of
dear
little
beth
but
i
can
only
feel
and--
he
could
not
get
any
further
for
he
too
turned
bashful
all
of
a
sudden
and
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
he
longed
to
lay
amy's
head
down
on
his
shoulder
and
tell
her
to
have
a
good
cry
but
he
did
not
dare
so
took
her
hand
instead
and
gave
it
a
sympathetic
squeeze
that
was
better
than
words
you
needn't
say
anything
this
comforts
me
she
said
softly
beth
is
well
and
happy
and
i
mustn't
wish
her
back
but
i
dread
the
going
home
much
as
i
long
to
see
them
all
we
won't
talk
about
it
now
for
it
makes
me
cry
and
i
want
to
enjoy
you
while
you
stay
you
needn't
go
right
back
need
you
not
if
you
want
me
dear
i
do
so
much
aunt
and
flo
are
very
kind
but
you
seem
like
one
of
the
family
and
it
would
be
so
comfortable
to
have
you
for
a
little
while
amy
spoke
and
looked
so
like
a
homesick
child
whose
heart
was
full
that
laurie
forgot
his
bashfulness
all
at
once
and
gave
her
just
what
she
wanted,--the
petting
she
was
used
to
and
the
cheerful
conversation
she
needed
poor
little
soul
you
look
as
if
you'd
grieved
yourself
half-sick
i'm
going
to
take
care
of
you
so
don't
cry
any
more
but
come
and
walk
about
with
me
the
wind
is
too
chilly
for
you
to
sit
still
he
said
in
the
half-caressing
half-commanding
way
that
amy
liked
as
he
tied
on
her
hat
drew
her
arm
through
his
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
sunny
walk
under
the
new-leaved
chestnuts
he
felt
more
at
ease
upon
his
legs
and
amy
found
it
very
pleasant
to
have
a
strong
arm
to
lean
upon
a
familiar
face
to
smile
at
her
and
a
kind
voice
to
talk
delightfully
for
her
alone
the
quaint
old
garden
had
sheltered
many
pairs
of
lovers
and
seemed
expressly
made
for
them
so
sunny
and
secluded
was
it
with
nothing
but
the
tower
to
overlook
them
and
the
wide
lake
to
carry
away
the
echo
of
their
words
as
it
rippled
by
below
for
an
hour
this
new
pair
walked
and
talked
or
rested
on
the
wall
enjoying
the
sweet
influences
which
gave
such
a
charm
to
time
and
place
and
when
an
unromantic
dinner-bell
warned
them
away
amy
felt
as
if
she
left
her
burden
of
loneliness
and
sorrow
behind
her
in
the
chateau
garden
the
moment
mrs
carrol
saw
the
girl's
altered
face
she
was
illuminated
with
a
new
idea
and
exclaimed
to
herself
now
i
understand
it
all,--the
child
has
been
pining
for
young
laurence
bless
my
heart
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
with
praiseworthy
discretion
the
good
lady
said
nothing
and
betrayed
no
sign
of
enlightenment
but
cordially
urged
laurie
to
stay
and
begged
amy
to
enjoy
his
society
for
it
would
do
her
more
good
than
so
much
solitude
amy
was
a
model
of
docility
and
as
her
aunt
was
a
good
deal
occupied
with
flo
she
was
left
to
entertain
her
friend
and
did
it
with
more
than
her
usual
success
at
nice
laurie
had
lounged
and
amy
had
scolded
at
vevay
laurie
was
never
idle
but
always
walking
riding
boating
or
studying
in
the
most
energetic
manner
while
amy
admired
everything
he
did
and
followed
his
example
as
far
and
as
fast
as
she
could
he
said
the
change
was
owing
to
the
climate
and
she
did
not
contradict
him
being
glad
of
a
like
excuse
for
her
own
recovered
health
and
spirits
the
invigorating
air
did
them
both
good
and
much
exercise
worked
wholesome
changes
in
minds
as
well
as
bodies
they
seemed
to
get
clearer
views
of
life
and
duty
up
there
among
the
everlasting
hills
the
fresh
winds
blew
away
desponding
doubts
delusive
fancies
and
moody
mists
the
warm
spring
sunshine
brought
out
all
sorts
of
aspiring
ideas
tender
hopes
and
happy
thoughts
the
lake
seemed
to
wash
away
the
troubles
of
the
past
and
the
grand
old
mountains
to
look
benignly
down
upon
them
saying
little
children
love
one
another
in
spite
of
the
new
sorrow
it
was
a
very
happy
time
so
happy
that
laurie
could
not
bear
to
disturb
it
by
a
word
it
took
him
a
little
while
to
recover
from
his
surprise
at
the
rapid
cure
of
his
first
and
as
he
had
firmly
believed
his
last
and
only
love
he
consoled
himself
for
the
seeming
disloyalty
by
the
thought
that
jo's
sister
was
almost
the
same
as
jo's
self
and
the
conviction
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
love
any
other
woman
but
amy
so
soon
and
so
well
his
first
wooing
had
been
of
the
tempestuous
order
and
he
looked
back
upon
it
as
if
through
a
long
vista
of
years
with
a
feeling
of
compassion
blended
with
regret
he
was
not
ashamed
of
it
but
put
it
away
as
one
of
the
bitter-sweet
experiences
of
his
life
for
which
he
could
be
grateful
when
the
pain
was
over
his
second
wooing
he
resolved
should
be
as
calm
and
simple
as
possible
there
was
no
need
of
having
a
scene
hardly
any
need
of
telling
amy
that
he
loved
her
she
knew
it
without
words
and
had
given
him
his
answer
long
ago
it
all
came
about
so
naturally
that
no
one
could
complain
and
he
knew
that
everybody
would
be
pleased
even
jo
but
when
our
first
little
passion
has
been
crushed
we
are
apt
to
be
wary
and
slow
in
making
a
second
trial
so
laurie
let
the
days
pass
enjoying
every
hour
and
leaving
to
chance
the
utterance
of
the
word
that
would
put
an
end
to
the
first
and
sweetest
part
of
his
new
romance
he
had
rather
imagined
that
the
_dénouement_
would
take
place
in
the
chateau
garden
by
moonlight
and
in
the
most
graceful
and
decorous
manner
but
it
turned
out
exactly
the
reverse
for
the
matter
was
settled
on
the
lake
at
noonday
in
a
few
blunt
words
they
had
been
floating
about
all
the
morning
from
gloomy
st
gingolf
to
sunny
montreux
with
the
alps
of
savoy
on
one
side
mont
st
bernard
and
the
dent
du
midi
on
the
other
pretty
vevay
in
the
valley
and
lausanne
upon
the
hill
beyond
a
cloudless
blue
sky
overhead
and
the
bluer
lake
below
dotted
with
the
picturesque
boats
that
look
like
white-winged
gulls
they
had
been
talking
of
bonnivard
as
they
glided
past
chillon
and
of
rousseau
as
they
looked
up
at
clarens
where
he
wrote
his
héloise
neither
had
read
it
but
they
knew
it
was
a
love-story
and
each
privately
wondered
if
it
was
half
as
interesting
as
their
own
amy
had
been
dabbling
her
hand
in
the
water
during
the
little
pause
that
fell
between
them
and
when
she
looked
up
laurie
was
leaning
on
his
oars
with
an
expression
in
his
eyes
that
made
her
say
hastily
merely
for
the
sake
of
saying
something,--
you
must
be
tired
rest
a
little
and
let
me
row
it
will
do
me
good
for
since
you
came
i
have
been
altogether
lazy
and
luxurious
i'm
not
tired
but
you
may
take
an
oar
if
you
like
there's
room
enough
though
i
have
to
sit
nearly
in
the
middle
else
the
boat
won't
trim
returned
laurie
as
if
he
rather
liked
the
arrangement
feeling
that
she
had
not
mended
matters
much
amy
took
the
offered
third
of
a
seat
shook
her
hair
over
her
face
and
accepted
an
oar
she
rowed
as
well
as
she
did
many
other
things
and
though
she
used
both
hands
and
laurie
but
one
the
oars
kept
time
and
the
boat
went
smoothly
through
the
water
illustration
how
well
we
pull
together
how
well
we
pull
together
don't
we
said
amy
who
objected
to
silence
just
then
so
well
that
i
wish
we
might
always
pull
in
the
same
boat
will
you
amy
very
tenderly
yes
laurie
very
low
then
they
both
stopped
rowing
and
unconsciously
added
a
pretty
little
_tableau_
of
human
love
and
happiness
to
the
dissolving
views
reflected
in
the
lake
xlii
all
alone
it
was
easy
to
promise
self-abnegation
when
self
was
wrapped
up
in
another
and
heart
and
soul
were
purified
by
a
sweet
example
but
when
the
helpful
voice
was
silent
the
daily
lesson
over
the
beloved
presence
gone
and
nothing
remained
but
loneliness
and
grief
then
jo
found
her
promise
very
hard
to
keep
how
could
she
comfort
father
and
mother
when
her
own
heart
ached
with
a
ceaseless
longing
for
her
sister
how
could
she
make
the
house
cheerful
when
all
its
light
and
warmth
and
beauty
seemed
to
have
deserted
it
when
beth
left
the
old
home
for
the
new
and
where
in
all
the
world
could
she
find
some
useful
happy
work
to
do
that
would
take
the
place
of
the
loving
service
which
had
been
its
own
reward
she
tried
in
a
blind
hopeless
way
to
do
her
duty
secretly
rebelling
against
it
all
the
while
for
it
seemed
unjust
that
her
few
joys
should
be
lessened
her
burdens
made
heavier
and
life
get
harder
and
harder
as
she
toiled
along
some
people
seemed
to
get
all
sunshine
and
some
all
shadow
it
was
not
fair
for
she
tried
more
than
amy
to
be
good
but
never
got
any
reward
only
disappointment
trouble
and
hard
work
poor
jo
these
were
dark
days
to
her
for
something
like
despair
came
over
her
when
she
thought
of
spending
all
her
life
in
that
quiet
house
devoted
to
humdrum
cares
a
few
small
pleasures
and
the
duty
that
never
seemed
to
grow
any
easier
i
can't
do
it
i
wasn't
meant
for
a
life
like
this
and
i
know
i
shall
break
away
and
do
something
desperate
if
somebody
don't
come
and
help
me
she
said
to
herself
when
her
first
efforts
failed
and
she
fell
into
the
moody
miserable
state
of
mind
which
often
comes
when
strong
wills
have
to
yield
to
the
inevitable
but
some
one
did
come
and
help
her
though
jo
did
not
recognize
her
good
angels
at
once
because
they
wore
familiar
shapes
and
used
the
simple
spells
best
fitted
to
poor
humanity
often
she
started
up
at
night
thinking
beth
called
her
and
when
the
sight
of
the
little
empty
bed
made
her
cry
with
the
bitter
cry
of
an
unsubmissive
sorrow
o
beth
come
back
come
back
she
did
not
stretch
out
her
yearning
arms
in
vain
for
as
quick
to
hear
her
sobbing
as
she
had
been
to
hear
her
sister's
faintest
whisper
her
mother
came
to
comfort
her
not
with
words
only
but
the
patient
tenderness
that
soothes
by
a
touch
tears
that
were
mute
reminders
of
a
greater
grief
than
jo's
and
broken
whispers
more
eloquent
than
prayers
because
hopeful
resignation
went
hand-in-hand
with
natural
sorrow
sacred
moments
when
heart
talked
to
heart
in
the
silence
of
the
night
turning
affliction
to
a
blessing
which
chastened
grief
and
strengthened
love
feeling
this
jo's
burden
seemed
easier
to
bear
duty
grew
sweeter
and
life
looked
more
endurable
seen
from
the
safe
shelter
of
her
mother's
arms
when
aching
heart
was
a
little
comforted
troubled
mind
likewise
found
help
for
one
day
she
went
to
the
study
and
leaning
over
the
good
gray
head
lifted
to
welcome
her
with
a
tranquil
smile
she
said
very
humbly,--
father
talk
to
me
as
you
did
to
beth
i
need
it
more
than
she
did
for
i'm
all
wrong
my
dear
nothing
can
comfort
me
like
this
he
answered
with
a
falter
in
his
voice
and
both
arms
round
her
as
if
he
too
needed
help
and
did
not
fear
to
ask
it
illustration
jo
and
her
father
then
sitting
in
beth's
little
chair
close
beside
him
jo
told
her
troubles,--the
resentful
sorrow
for
her
loss
the
fruitless
efforts
that
discouraged
her
the
want
of
faith
that
made
life
look
so
dark
and
all
the
sad
bewilderment
which
we
call
despair
she
gave
him
entire
confidence
he
gave
her
the
help
she
needed
and
both
found
consolation
in
the
act
for
the
time
had
come
when
they
could
talk
together
not
only
as
father
and
daughter
but
as
man
and
woman
able
and
glad
to
serve
each
other
with
mutual
sympathy
as
well
as
mutual
love
happy
thoughtful
times
there
in
the
old
study
which
jo
called
the
church
of
one
member
and
from
which
she
came
with
fresh
courage
recovered
cheerfulness
and
a
more
submissive
spirit
for
the
parents
who
had
taught
one
child
to
meet
death
without
fear
were
trying
now
to
teach
another
to
accept
life
without
despondency
or
distrust
and
to
use
its
beautiful
opportunities
with
gratitude
and
power
other
helps
had
jo,--humble
wholesome
duties
and
delights
that
would
not
be
denied
their
part
in
serving
her
and
which
she
slowly
learned
to
see
and
value
brooms
and
dishcloths
never
could
be
as
distasteful
as
they
once
had
been
for
beth
had
presided
over
both
and
something
of
her
housewifely
spirit
seemed
to
linger
round
the
little
mop
and
the
old
brush
that
was
never
thrown
away
as
she
used
them
jo
found
herself
humming
the
songs
beth
used
to
hum
imitating
beth's
orderly
ways
and
giving
the
little
touches
here
and
there
that
kept
everything
fresh
and
cosey
which
was
the
first
step
toward
making
home
happy
though
she
didn't
know
it
till
hannah
said
with
an
approving
squeeze
of
the
hand,--
you
thoughtful
creter
you're
determined
we
sha'n't
miss
that
dear
lamb
ef
you
can
help
it
we
don't
say
much
but
we
see
it
and
the
lord
will
bless
you
for't
see
ef
he
don't
as
they
sat
sewing
together
jo
discovered
how
much
improved
her
sister
meg
was
how
well
she
could
talk
how
much
she
knew
about
good
womanly
impulses
thoughts
and
feelings
how
happy
she
was
in
husband
and
children
and
how
much
they
were
all
doing
for
each
other
marriage
is
an
excellent
thing
after
all
i
wonder
if
i
should
blossom
out
half
as
well
as
you
have
if
i
tried
it
said
jo
as
she
constructed
a
kite
for
demi
in
the
topsy-turvy
nursery
it's
just
what
you
need
to
bring
out
the
tender
womanly
half
of
your
nature
jo
you
are
like
a
chestnut-burr
prickly
outside
but
silky-soft
within
and
a
sweet
kernel
if
one
can
only
get
at
it
love
will
make
you
show
your
heart
some
day
and
then
the
rough
burr
will
fall
off
frost
opens
chestnut-burrs
ma'am
and
it
takes
a
good
shake
to
bring
them
down
boys
go
nutting
and
i
don't
care
to
be
bagged
by
them
returned
jo
pasting
away
at
the
kite
which
no
wind
that
blows
would
ever
carry
up
for
daisy
had
tied
herself
on
as
a
bob
meg
laughed
for
she
was
glad
to
see
a
glimmer
of
jo's
old
spirit
but
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
enforce
her
opinion
by
every
argument
in
her
power
and
the
sisterly
chats
were
not
wasted
especially
as
two
of
meg's
most
effective
arguments
were
the
babies
whom
jo
loved
tenderly
grief
is
the
best
opener
for
some
hearts
and
jo's
was
nearly
ready
for
the
bag
a
little
more
sunshine
to
ripen
the
nut
then
not
a
boy's
impatient
shake
but
a
man's
hand
reached
up
to
pick
it
gently
from
the
burr
and
find
the
kernel
sound
and
sweet
if
she
had
suspected
this
she
would
have
shut
up
tight
and
been
more
prickly
than
ever
fortunately
she
wasn't
thinking
about
herself
so
when
the
time
came
down
she
dropped
now
if
she
had
been
the
heroine
of
a
moral
story-book
she
ought
at
this
period
of
her
life
to
have
become
quite
saintly
renounced
the
world
and
gone
about
doing
good
in
a
mortified
bonnet
with
tracts
in
her
pocket
but
you
see
jo
wasn't
a
heroine
she
was
only
a
struggling
human
girl
like
hundreds
of
others
and
she
just
acted
out
her
nature
being
sad
cross
listless
or
energetic
as
the
mood
suggested
it's
highly
virtuous
to
say
we'll
be
good
but
we
can't
do
it
all
at
once
and
it
takes
a
long
pull
a
strong
pull
and
a
pull
all
together
before
some
of
us
even
get
our
feet
set
in
the
right
way
jo
had
got
so
far
she
was
learning
to
do
her
duty
and
to
feel
unhappy
if
she
did
not
but
to
do
it
cheerfully--ah
that
was
another
thing
she
had
often
said
she
wanted
to
do
something
splendid
no
matter
how
hard
and
now
she
had
her
wish
for
what
could
be
more
beautiful
than
to
devote
her
life
to
father
and
mother
trying
to
make
home
as
happy
to
them
as
they
had
to
her
and
if
difficulties
were
necessary
to
increase
the
splendor
of
the
effort
what
could
be
harder
for
a
restless
ambitious
girl
than
to
give
up
her
own
hopes
plans
and
desires
and
cheerfully
live
for
others
providence
had
taken
her
at
her
word
here
was
the
task
not
what
she
had
expected
but
better
because
self
had
no
part
in
it
now
could
she
do
it
she
decided
that
she
would
try
and
in
her
first
attempt
she
found
the
helps
i
have
suggested
still
another
was
given
her
and
she
took
it
not
as
a
reward
but
as
a
comfort
as
christian
took
the
refreshment
afforded
by
the
little
arbor
where
he
rested
as
he
climbed
the
hill
called
difficulty
why
don't
you
write
that
always
used
to
make
you
happy
said
her
mother
once
when
the
desponding
fit
overshadowed
jo
i've
no
heart
to
write
and
if
i
had
nobody
cares
for
my
things
we
do
write
something
for
us
and
never
mind
the
rest
of
the
world
try
it
dear
i'm
sure
it
would
do
you
good
and
please
us
very
much
don't
believe
i
can
but
jo
got
out
her
desk
and
began
to
overhaul
her
half-finished
manuscripts
an
hour
afterward
her
mother
peeped
in
and
there
she
was
scratching
away
with
her
black
pinafore
on
and
an
absorbed
expression
which
caused
mrs
march
to
smile
and
slip
away
well
pleased
with
the
success
of
her
suggestion
jo
never
knew
how
it
happened
but
something
got
into
that
story
that
went
straight
to
the
hearts
of
those
who
read
it
for
when
her
family
had
laughed
and
cried
over
it
her
father
sent
it
much
against
her
will
to
one
of
the
popular
magazines
and
to
her
utter
surprise
it
was
not
only
paid
for
but
others
requested
letters
from
several
persons
whose
praise
was
honor
followed
the
appearance
of
the
little
story
newspapers
copied
it
and
strangers
as
well
as
friends
admired
it
for
a
small
thing
it
was
a
great
success
and
jo
was
more
astonished
than
when
her
novel
was
commended
and
condemned
all
at
once
i
don't
understand
it
what
_can_
there
be
in
a
simple
little
story
like
that
to
make
people
praise
it
so
she
said
quite
bewildered
there
is
truth
in
it
jo
that's
the
secret
humor
and
pathos
make
it
alive
and
you
have
found
your
style
at
last
you
wrote
with
no
thought
of
fame
or
money
and
put
your
heart
into
it
my
daughter
you
have
had
the
bitter
now
comes
the
sweet
do
your
best
and
grow
as
happy
as
we
are
in
your
success
if
there
_is_
anything
good
or
true
in
what
i
write
it
isn't
mine
i
owe
it
all
to
you
and
mother
and
to
beth
said
jo
more
touched
by
her
father's
words
than
by
any
amount
of
praise
from
the
world
so
taught
by
love
and
sorrow
jo
wrote
her
little
stories
and
sent
them
away
to
make
friends
for
themselves
and
her
finding
it
a
very
charitable
world
to
such
humble
wanderers
for
they
were
kindly
welcomed
and
sent
home
comfortable
tokens
to
their
mother
like
dutiful
children
whom
good
fortune
overtakes
when
amy
and
laurie
wrote
of
their
engagement
mrs
march
feared
that
jo
would
find
it
difficult
to
rejoice
over
it
but
her
fears
were
soon
set
at
rest
for
though
jo
looked
grave
at
first
she
took
it
very
quietly
and
was
full
of
hopes
and
plans
for
the
children
before
she
read
the
letter
twice
it
was
a
sort
of
written
duet
wherein
each
glorified
the
other
in
lover-like
fashion
very
pleasant
to
read
and
satisfactory
to
think
of
for
no
one
had
any
objection
to
make
you
like
it
mother
said
jo
as
they
laid
down
the
closely
written
sheets
and
looked
at
one
another
yes
i
hoped
it
would
be
so
ever
since
amy
wrote
that
she
had
refused
fred
i
felt
sure
then
that
something
better
than
what
you
call
the
'mercenary
spirit'
had
come
over
her
and
a
hint
here
and
there
in
her
letters
made
me
suspect
that
love
and
laurie
would
win
the
day
how
sharp
you
are
marmee
and
how
silent
you
never
said
a
word
to
me
mothers
have
need
of
sharp
eyes
and
discreet
tongues
when
they
have
girls
to
manage
i
was
half
afraid
to
put
the
idea
into
your
head
lest
you
should
write
and
congratulate
them
before
the
thing
was
settled
i'm
not
the
scatter-brain
i
was
you
may
trust
me
i'm
sober
and
sensible
enough
for
any
one's
_confidante_
now
so
you
are
dear
and
i
should
have
made
you
mine
only
i
fancied
it
might
pain
you
to
learn
that
your
teddy
loved
any
one
else
now
mother
did
you
really
think
i
could
be
so
silly
and
selfish
after
i'd
refused
his
love
when
it
was
freshest
if
not
best
i
knew
you
were
sincere
then
jo
but
lately
i
have
thought
that
if
he
came
back
and
asked
again
you
might
perhaps
feel
like
giving
another
answer
forgive
me
dear
i
can't
help
seeing
that
you
are
very
lonely
and
sometimes
there
is
a
hungry
look
in
your
eyes
that
goes
to
my
heart
so
i
fancied
that
your
boy
might
fill
the
empty
place
if
he
tried
now
no
mother
it
is
better
as
it
is
and
i'm
glad
amy
has
learned
to
love
him
but
you
are
right
in
one
thing
i
_am_
lonely
and
perhaps
if
teddy
had
tried
again
i
might
have
said
'yes,'
not
because
i
love
him
any
more
but
because
i
care
more
to
be
loved
than
when
he
went
away
i'm
glad
of
that
jo
for
it
shows
that
you
are
getting
on
there
are
plenty
to
love
you
so
try
to
be
satisfied
with
father
and
mother
sisters
and
brothers
friends
and
babies
till
the
best
lover
of
all
comes
to
give
you
your
reward
mothers
are
the
_best_
lovers
in
the
world
but
i
don't
mind
whispering
to
marmee
that
i'd
like
to
try
all
kinds
it's
very
curious
but
the
more
i
try
to
satisfy
myself
with
all
sorts
of
natural
affections
the
more
i
seem
to
want
i'd
no
idea
hearts
could
take
in
so
many
mine
is
so
elastic
it
never
seems
full
now
and
i
used
to
be
quite
contented
with
my
family
i
don't
understand
it
i
do
and
mrs
march
smiled
her
wise
smile
as
jo
turned
back
the
leaves
to
read
what
amy
said
of
laurie
it
is
so
beautiful
to
be
loved
as
laurie
loves
me
he
isn't
sentimental
doesn't
say
much
about
it
but
i
see
and
feel
it
in
all
he
says
and
does
and
it
makes
me
so
happy
and
so
humble
that
i
don't
seem
to
be
the
same
girl
i
was
i
never
knew
how
good
and
generous
and
tender
he
was
till
now
for
he
lets
me
read
his
heart
and
i
find
it
full
of
noble
impulses
and
hopes
and
purposes
and
am
so
proud
to
know
it's
mine
he
says
he
feels
as
if
he
'could
make
a
prosperous
voyage
now
with
me
aboard
as
mate
and
lots
of
love
for
ballast.'
i
pray
he
may
and
try
to
be
all
he
believes
me
for
i
love
my
gallant
captain
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
might
and
never
will
desert
him
while
god
lets
us
be
together
o
mother
i
never
knew
how
much
like
heaven
this
world
could
be
when
two
people
love
and
live
for
one
another
and
that's
our
cool
reserved
and
worldly
amy
truly
love
does
work
miracles
how
very
very
happy
they
must
be
and
jo
laid
the
rustling
sheets
together
with
a
careful
hand
as
one
might
shut
the
covers
of
a
lovely
romance
which
holds
the
reader
fast
till
the
end
comes
and
he
finds
himself
alone
in
the
work-a-day
world
again
by
and
by
jo
roamed
away
upstairs
for
it
was
rainy
and
she
could
not
walk
a
restless
spirit
possessed
her
and
the
old
feeling
came
again
not
bitter
as
it
once
was
but
a
sorrowfully
patient
wonder
why
one
sister
should
have
all
she
asked
the
other
nothing
it
was
not
true
she
knew
that
and
tried
to
put
it
away
but
the
natural
craving
for
affection
was
strong
and
amy's
happiness
woke
the
hungry
longing
for
some
one
to
love
with
heart
and
soul
and
cling
to
while
god
let
them
be
together
up
in
the
garret
where
jo's
unquiet
wanderings
ended
stood
four
little
wooden
chests
in
a
row
each
marked
with
its
owner's
name
and
each
filled
with
relics
of
the
childhood
and
girlhood
ended
now
for
all
jo
glanced
into
them
and
when
she
came
to
her
own
leaned
her
chin
on
the
edge
and
stared
absently
at
the
chaotic
collection
till
a
bundle
of
old
exercise-books
caught
her
eye
she
drew
them
out
turned
them
over
and
re-lived
that
pleasant
winter
at
kind
mrs
kirke's
she
had
smiled
at
first
then
she
looked
thoughtful
next
sad
and
when
she
came
to
a
little
message
written
in
the
professor's
hand
her
lips
began
to
tremble
the
books
slid
out
of
her
lap
and
she
sat
looking
at
the
friendly
words
as
if
they
took
a
new
meaning
and
touched
a
tender
spot
in
her
heart
wait
for
me
my
friend
i
may
be
a
little
late
but
i
shall
surely
come
oh
if
he
only
would
so
kind
so
good
so
patient
with
me
always
my
dear
old
fritz
i
didn't
value
him
half
enough
when
i
had
him
but
now
how
i
should
love
to
see
him
for
every
one
seems
going
away
from
me
and
i'm
all
alone
and
holding
the
little
paper
fast
as
if
it
were
a
promise
yet
to
be
fulfilled
jo
laid
her
head
down
on
a
comfortable
rag-bag
and
cried
as
if
in
opposition
to
the
rain
pattering
on
the
roof
illustration
jo
laid
her
head
on
a
comfortable
rag-bag
and
cried
was
it
all
self-pity
loneliness
or
low
spirits
or
was
it
the
waking
up
of
a
sentiment
which
had
bided
its
time
as
patiently
as
its
inspirer
who
shall
say
illustration
a
substantial
lifelike
ghost
leaning
over
her
xliii
surprises
jo
was
alone
in
the
twilight
lying
on
the
old
sofa
looking
at
the
fire
and
thinking
it
was
her
favorite
way
of
spending
the
hour
of
dusk
no
one
disturbed
her
and
she
used
to
lie
there
on
beth's
little
red
pillow
planning
stories
dreaming
dreams
or
thinking
tender
thoughts
of
the
sister
who
never
seemed
far
away
her
face
looked
tired
grave
and
rather
sad
for
to-morrow
was
her
birthday
and
she
was
thinking
how
fast
the
years
went
by
how
old
she
was
getting
and
how
little
she
seemed
to
have
accomplished
almost
twenty-five
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
jo
was
mistaken
in
that
there
was
a
good
deal
to
show
and
by
and
by
she
saw
and
was
grateful
for
it
an
old
maid
that's
what
i'm
to
be
a
literary
spinster
with
a
pen
for
a
spouse
a
family
of
stories
for
children
and
twenty
years
hence
a
morsel
of
fame
perhaps
when
like
poor
johnson
i'm
old
and
can't
enjoy
it
solitary
and
can't
share
it
independent
and
don't
need
it
well
i
needn't
be
a
sour
saint
nor
a
selfish
sinner
and
i
dare
say
old
maids
are
very
comfortable
when
they
get
used
to
it
but--
and
there
jo
sighed
as
if
the
prospect
was
not
inviting
it
seldom
is
at
first
and
thirty
seems
the
end
of
all
things
to
five-and-twenty
but
it's
not
so
bad
as
it
looks
and
one
can
get
on
quite
happily
if
one
has
something
in
one's
self
to
fall
back
upon
at
twenty-five
girls
begin
to
talk
about
being
old
maids
but
secretly
resolve
that
they
never
will
be
at
thirty
they
say
nothing
about
it
but
quietly
accept
the
fact
and
if
sensible
console
themselves
by
remembering
that
they
have
twenty
more
useful
happy
years
in
which
they
may
be
learning
to
grow
old
gracefully
don't
laugh
at
the
spinsters
dear
girls
for
often
very
tender
tragical
romances
are
hidden
away
in
the
hearts
that
beat
so
quietly
under
the
sober
gowns
and
many
silent
sacrifices
of
youth
health
ambition
love
itself
make
the
faded
faces
beautiful
in
god's
sight
even
the
sad
sour
sisters
should
be
kindly
dealt
with
because
they
have
missed
the
sweetest
part
of
life
if
for
no
other
reason
and
looking
at
them
with
compassion
not
contempt
girls
in
their
bloom
should
remember
that
they
too
may
miss
the
blossom
time
that
rosy
cheeks
don't
last
forever
that
silver
threads
will
come
in
the
bonnie
brown
hair
and
that
by
and
by
kindness
and
respect
will
be
as
sweet
as
love
and
admiration
now
gentlemen
which
means
boys
be
courteous
to
the
old
maids
no
matter
how
poor
and
plain
and
prim
for
the
only
chivalry
worth
having
is
that
which
is
the
readiest
to
pay
deference
to
the
old
protect
the
feeble
and
serve
womankind
regardless
of
rank
age
or
color
just
recollect
the
good
aunts
who
have
not
only
lectured
and
fussed
but
nursed
and
petted
too
often
without
thanks
the
scrapes
they
have
helped
you
out
of
the
tips
they
have
given
you
from
their
small
store
the
stitches
the
patient
old
fingers
have
set
for
you
the
steps
the
willing
old
feet
have
taken
and
gratefully
pay
the
dear
old
ladies
the
little
attentions
that
women
love
to
receive
as
long
as
they
live
the
bright-eyed
girls
are
quick
to
see
such
traits
and
will
like
you
all
the
better
for
them
and
if
death
almost
the
only
power
that
can
part
mother
and
son
should
rob
you
of
yours
you
will
be
sure
to
find
a
tender
welcome
and
maternal
cherishing
from
some
aunt
priscilla
who
has
kept
the
warmest
corner
of
her
lonely
old
heart
for
the
the
best
nevvy
in
the
world
jo
must
have
fallen
asleep
as
i
dare
say
my
reader
has
during
this
little
homily
for
suddenly
laurie's
ghost
seemed
to
stand
before
her,--a
substantial
lifelike
ghost,--leaning
over
her
with
the
very
look
he
used
to
wear
when
he
felt
a
good
deal
and
didn't
like
to
show
it
but
like
jenny
in
the
ballad,--
she
could
not
think
it
he
and
lay
staring
up
at
him
in
startled
silence
till
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
then
she
knew
him
and
flew
up
crying
joyfully,--
o
my
teddy
o
my
teddy
dear
jo
you
are
glad
to
see
me
then
glad
my
blessed
boy
words
can't
express
my
gladness
where's
amy
your
mother
has
got
her
down
at
meg's
we
stopped
there
by
the
way
and
there
was
no
getting
my
wife
out
of
their
clutches
your
what
cried
jo
for
laurie
uttered
those
two
words
with
an
unconscious
pride
and
satisfaction
which
betrayed
him
oh
the
dickens
now
i've
done
it
and
he
looked
so
guilty
that
jo
was
down
upon
him
like
a
flash
you've
gone
and
got
married
yes
please
but
i
never
will
again
and
he
went
down
upon
his
knees
with
a
penitent
clasping
of
hands
and
a
face
full
of
mischief
mirth
and
triumph
actually
married
very
much
so
thank
you
mercy
on
us
what
dreadful
thing
will
you
do
next
and
jo
fell
into
her
seat
with
a
gasp
a
characteristic
but
not
exactly
complimentary
congratulation
returned
laurie
still
in
an
abject
attitude
but
beaming
with
satisfaction
what
can
you
expect
when
you
take
one's
breath
away
creeping
in
like
a
burglar
and
letting
cats
out
of
bags
like
that
get
up
you
ridiculous
boy
and
tell
me
all
about
it
not
a
word
unless
you
let
me
come
in
my
old
place
and
promise
not
to
barricade
jo
laughed
at
that
as
she
had
not
done
for
many
a
long
day
and
patted
the
sofa
invitingly
as
she
said
in
a
cordial
tone,--
the
old
pillow
is
up
garret
and
we
don't
need
it
now
so
come
and
'fess
teddy
how
good
it
sounds
to
hear
you
say
'teddy'
no
one
ever
calls
me
that
but
you
and
laurie
sat
down
with
an
air
of
great
content
what
does
amy
call
you
my
lord
that's
like
her
well
you
look
it
and
jo's
eyes
plainly
betrayed
that
she
found
her
boy
comelier
than
ever
the
pillow
was
gone
but
there
_was_
a
barricade
nevertheless,--a
natural
one
raised
by
time
absence
and
change
of
heart
both
felt
it
and
for
a
minute
looked
at
one
another
as
if
that
invisible
barrier
cast
a
little
shadow
over
them
it
was
gone
directly
however
for
laurie
said
with
a
vain
attempt
at
dignity,--
don't
i
look
like
a
married
man
and
the
head
of
a
family
not
a
bit
and
you
never
will
you've
grown
bigger
and
bonnier
but
you
are
the
same
scapegrace
as
ever
now
really
jo
you
ought
to
treat
me
with
more
respect
began
laurie
who
enjoyed
it
all
immensely
how
can
i
when
the
mere
idea
of
you
married
and
settled
is
so
irresistibly
funny
that
i
can't
keep
sober
answered
jo
smiling
all
over
her
face
so
infectiously
that
they
had
another
laugh
and
then
settled
down
for
a
good
talk
quite
in
the
pleasant
old
fashion
it's
no
use
your
going
out
in
the
cold
to
get
amy
for
they
are
all
coming
up
presently
i
couldn't
wait
i
wanted
to
be
the
one
to
tell
you
the
grand
surprise
and
have
'first
skim,'
as
we
used
to
say
when
we
squabbled
about
the
cream
of
course
you
did
and
spoilt
your
story
by
beginning
at
the
wrong
end
now
start
right
and
tell
me
how
it
all
happened
i'm
pining
to
know
well
i
did
it
to
please
amy
began
laurie
with
a
twinkle
that
made
jo
exclaim,--
fib
number
one
amy
did
it
to
please
you
go
on
and
tell
the
truth
if
you
can
sir
now
she's
beginning
to
marm
it
isn't
it
jolly
to
hear
her
said
laurie
to
the
fire
and
the
fire
glowed
and
sparkled
as
if
it
quite
agreed
it's
all
the
same
you
know
she
and
i
being
one
we
planned
to
come
home
with
the
carrols
a
month
or
more
ago
but
they
suddenly
changed
their
minds
and
decided
to
pass
another
winter
in
paris
but
grandpa
wanted
to
come
home
he
went
to
please
me
and
i
couldn't
let
him
go
alone
neither
could
i
leave
amy
and
mrs
carrol
had
got
english
notions
about
chaperons
and
such
nonsense
and
wouldn't
let
amy
come
with
us
so
i
just
settled
the
difficulty
by
saying
'let's
be
married
and
then
we
can
do
as
we
like.'
of
course
you
did
you
always
have
things
to
suit
you
not
always
and
something
in
laurie's
voice
made
jo
say
hastily,--
how
did
you
ever
get
aunt
to
agree
it
was
hard
work
but
between
us
we
talked
her
over
for
we
had
heaps
of
good
reasons
on
our
side
there
wasn't
time
to
write
and
ask
leave
but
you
all
liked
it
had
consented
to
it
by
and
by
and
it
was
only
'taking
time
by
the
fetlock,'
as
my
wife
says
aren't
we
proud
of
those
two
words
and
don't
we
like
to
say
them
interrupted
jo
addressing
the
fire
in
her
turn
and
watching
with
delight
the
happy
light
it
seemed
to
kindle
in
the
eyes
that
had
been
so
tragically
gloomy
when
she
saw
them
last
a
trifle
perhaps
she's
such
a
captivating
little
woman
i
can't
help
being
proud
of
her
well
then
uncle
and
aunt
were
there
to
play
propriety
we
were
so
absorbed
in
one
another
we
were
of
no
mortal
use
apart
and
that
charming
arrangement
would
make
everything
easy
all
round
so
we
did
it
when
where
how
asked
jo
in
a
fever
of
feminine
interest
and
curiosity
for
she
could
not
realize
it
a
particle
six
weeks
ago
at
the
american
consul's
in
paris
a
very
quiet
wedding
of
course
for
even
in
our
happiness
we
didn't
forget
dear
little
beth
jo
put
her
hand
in
his
as
he
said
that
and
laurie
gently
smoothed
the
little
red
pillow
which
he
remembered
well
why
didn't
you
let
us
know
afterward
asked
jo
in
a
quieter
tone
when
they
had
sat
quite
still
a
minute
we
wanted
to
surprise
you
we
thought
we
were
coming
directly
home
at
first
but
the
dear
old
gentleman
as
soon
as
we
were
married
found
he
couldn't
be
ready
under
a
month
at
least
and
sent
us
off
to
spend
our
honeymoon
wherever
we
liked
amy
had
once
called
valrosa
a
regular
honeymoon
home
so
we
went
there
and
were
as
happy
as
people
are
but
once
in
their
lives
my
faith
wasn't
it
love
among
the
roses
laurie
seemed
to
forget
jo
for
a
minute
and
jo
was
glad
of
it
for
the
fact
that
he
told
her
these
things
so
freely
and
naturally
assured
her
that
he
had
quite
forgiven
and
forgotten
she
tried
to
draw
away
her
hand
but
as
if
he
guessed
the
thought
that
prompted
the
half-involuntary
impulse
laurie
held
it
fast
and
said
with
a
manly
gravity
she
had
never
seen
in
him
before,--
jo
dear
i
want
to
say
one
thing
and
then
we'll
put
it
by
forever
as
i
told
you
in
my
letter
when
i
wrote
that
amy
had
been
so
kind
to
me
i
never
shall
stop
loving
you
but
the
love
is
altered
and
i
have
learned
to
see
that
it
is
better
as
it
is
amy
and
you
change
places
in
my
heart
that's
all
i
think
it
was
meant
to
be
so
and
would
have
come
about
naturally
if
i
had
waited
as
you
tried
to
make
me
but
i
never
could
be
patient
and
so
i
got
a
heartache
i
was
a
boy
then
headstrong
and
violent
and
it
took
a
hard
lesson
to
show
me
my
mistake
for
it
_was_
one
jo
as
you
said
and
i
found
it
out
after
making
a
fool
of
myself
upon
my
word
i
was
so
tumbled
up
in
my
mind
at
one
time
that
i
didn't
know
which
i
loved
best
you
or
amy
and
tried
to
love
both
alike
but
i
couldn't
and
when
i
saw
her
in
switzerland
everything
seemed
to
clear
up
all
at
once
you
both
got
into
your
right
places
and
i
felt
sure
that
it
was
well
off
with
the
old
love
before
it
was
on
with
the
new
that
i
could
honestly
share
my
heart
between
sister
jo
and
wife
amy
and
love
them
both
dearly
will
you
believe
it
and
go
back
to
the
happy
old
times
when
we
first
knew
one
another
i'll
believe
it
with
all
my
heart
but
teddy
we
never
can
be
boy
and
girl
again
the
happy
old
times
can't
come
back
and
we
mustn't
expect
it
we
are
man
and
woman
now
with
sober
work
to
do
for
playtime
is
over
and
we
must
give
up
frolicking
i'm
sure
you
feel
this
i
see
the
change
in
you
and
you'll
find
it
in
me
i
shall
miss
my
boy
but
i
shall
love
the
man
as
much
and
admire
him
more
because
he
means
to
be
what
i
hoped
he
would
we
can't
be
little
playmates
any
longer
but
we
will
be
brother
and
sister
to
love
and
help
one
another
all
our
lives
won't
we
laurie
he
did
not
say
a
word
but
took
the
hand
she
offered
him
and
laid
his
face
down
on
it
for
a
minute
feeling
that
out
of
the
grave
of
a
boyish
passion
there
had
risen
a
beautiful
strong
friendship
to
bless
them
both
presently
jo
said
cheerfully
for
she
didn't
want
the
coming
home
to
be
a
sad
one,--
i
can't
make
it
true
that
you
children
are
really
married
and
going
to
set
up
housekeeping
why
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
i
was
buttoning
amy's
pinafore
and
pulling
your
hair
when
you
teased
mercy
me
how
time
does
fly
as
one
of
the
children
is
older
than
yourself
you
needn't
talk
so
like
a
grandma
i
flatter
myself
i'm
a
'gentleman
growed,'
as
peggotty
said
of
david
and
when
you
see
amy
you'll
find
her
rather
a
precocious
infant
said
laurie
looking
amused
at
her
maternal
air
you
may
be
a
little
older
in
years
but
i'm
ever
so
much
older
in
feeling
teddy
women
always
are
and
this
last
year
has
been
such
a
hard
one
that
i
feel
forty
poor
jo
we
left
you
to
bear
it
alone
while
we
went
pleasuring
you
_are_
older
here's
a
line
and
there's
another
unless
you
smile
your
eyes
look
sad
and
when
i
touched
the
cushion
just
now
i
found
a
tear
on
it
you've
had
a
great
deal
to
bear
and
had
to
bear
it
all
alone
what
a
selfish
beast
i've
been
and
laurie
pulled
his
own
hair
with
a
remorseful
look
but
jo
only
turned
over
the
traitorous
pillow
and
answered
in
a
tone
which
she
tried
to
make
quite
cheerful,--
no
i
had
father
and
mother
to
help
me
the
dear
babies
to
comfort
me
and
the
thought
that
you
and
amy
were
safe
and
happy
to
make
the
troubles
here
easier
to
bear
i
_am_
lonely
sometimes
but
i
dare
say
it's
good
for
me
and--
you
never
shall
be
again
broke
in
laurie
putting
his
arm
about
her
as
if
to
fence
out
every
human
ill
amy
and
i
can't
get
on
without
you
so
you
must
come
and
teach
'the
children'
to
keep
house
and
go
halves
in
everything
just
as
we
used
to
do
and
let
us
pet
you
and
all
be
blissfully
happy
and
friendly
together
if
i
shouldn't
be
in
the
way
it
would
be
very
pleasant
i
begin
to
feel
quite
young
already
for
somehow
all
my
troubles
seemed
to
fly
away
when
you
came
you
always
were
a
comfort
teddy
and
jo
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
just
as
she
did
years
ago
when
beth
lay
ill
and
laurie
told
her
to
hold
on
to
him
he
looked
down
at
her
wondering
if
she
remembered
the
time
but
jo
was
smiling
to
herself
as
if
in
truth
her
troubles
_had_
all
vanished
at
his
coming
you
are
the
same
jo
still
dropping
tears
about
one
minute
and
laughing
the
next
you
look
a
little
wicked
now
what
is
it
grandma
i
was
wondering
how
you
and
amy
get
on
together
like
angels
yes
of
course
at
first
but
which
rules
i
don't
mind
telling
you
that
she
does
now
at
least
i
let
her
think
so,--it
pleases
her
you
know
by
and
by
we
shall
take
turns
for
marriage
they
say
halves
one's
rights
and
doubles
one's
duties
you'll
go
on
as
you
begin
and
amy
will
rule
you
all
the
days
of
your
life
well
she
does
it
so
imperceptibly
that
i
don't
think
i
shall
mind
much
she
is
the
sort
of
woman
who
knows
how
to
rule
well
in
fact
i
rather
like
it
for
she
winds
one
round
her
finger
as
softly
and
prettily
as
a
skein
of
silk
and
makes
you
feel
as
if
she
was
doing
you
a
favor
all
the
while
that
ever
i
should
live
to
see
you
a
henpecked
husband
and
enjoying
it
cried
jo
with
uplifted
hands
it
was
good
to
see
laurie
square
his
shoulders
and
smile
with
masculine
scorn
at
that
insinuation
as
he
replied
with
his
high
and
mighty
air,--
amy
is
too
well-bred
for
that
and
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
to
submit
to
it
my
wife
and
i
respect
ourselves
and
one
another
too
much
ever
to
tyrannize
or
quarrel
jo
liked
that
and
thought
the
new
dignity
very
becoming
but
the
boy
seemed
changing
very
fast
into
the
man
and
regret
mingled
with
her
pleasure
i
am
sure
of
that
amy
and
you
never
did
quarrel
as
we
used
to
she
is
the
sun
and
i
the
wind
in
the
fable
and
the
sun
managed
the
man
best
you
remember
she
can
blow
him
up
as
well
as
shine
on
him
laughed
laurie
such
a
lecture
as
i
got
at
nice
i
give
you
my
word
it
was
a
deal
worse
than
any
of
your
scoldings,--a
regular
rouser
i'll
tell
you
all
about
it
sometime,--_she_
never
will
because
after
telling
me
that
she
despised
and
was
ashamed
of
me
she
lost
her
heart
to
the
despicable
party
and
married
the
good-for-nothing
what
baseness
well
if
she
abuses
you
come
to
me
and
i'll
defend
you
i
look
as
if
i
needed
it
don't
i
said
laurie
getting
up
and
striking
an
attitude
which
suddenly
changed
from
the
imposing
to
the
rapturous
as
amy's
voice
was
heard
calling,--
where
is
she
where's
my
dear
old
jo
in
trooped
the
whole
family
and
every
one
was
hugged
and
kissed
all
over
again
and
after
several
vain
attempts
the
three
wanderers
were
set
down
to
be
looked
at
and
exulted
over
mr
laurence
hale
and
hearty
as
ever
was
quite
as
much
improved
as
the
others
by
his
foreign
tour
for
the
crustiness
seemed
to
be
nearly
gone
and
the
old-fashioned
courtliness
had
received
a
polish
which
made
it
kindlier
than
ever
it
was
good
to
see
him
beam
at
my
children
as
he
called
the
young
pair
it
was
better
still
to
see
amy
pay
him
the
daughterly
duty
and
affection
which
completely
won
his
old
heart
and
best
of
all
to
watch
laurie
revolve
about
the
two
as
if
never
tired
of
enjoying
the
pretty
picture
they
made
the
minute
she
put
her
eyes
upon
amy
meg
became
conscious
that
her
own
dress
hadn't
a
parisian
air
that
young
mrs
moffat
would
be
entirely
eclipsed
by
young
mrs
laurence
and
that
her
ladyship
was
altogether
a
most
elegant
and
graceful
woman
jo
thought
as
she
watched
the
pair
how
well
they
look
together
i
was
right
and
laurie
has
found
the
beautiful
accomplished
girl
who
will
become
his
home
better
than
clumsy
old
jo
and
be
a
pride
not
a
torment
to
him
mrs
march
and
her
husband
smiled
and
nodded
at
each
other
with
happy
faces
for
they
saw
that
their
youngest
had
done
well
not
only
in
worldly
things
but
the
better
wealth
of
love
confidence
and
happiness
for
amy's
face
was
full
of
the
soft
brightness
which
betokens
a
peaceful
heart
her
voice
had
a
new
tenderness
in
it
and
the
cool
prim
carriage
was
changed
to
a
gentle
dignity
both
womanly
and
winning
no
little
affectations
marred
it
and
the
cordial
sweetness
of
her
manner
was
more
charming
than
the
new
beauty
or
the
old
grace
for
it
stamped
her
at
once
with
the
unmistakable
sign
of
the
true
gentlewoman
she
had
hoped
to
become
love
has
done
much
for
our
little
girl
said
her
mother
softly
she
has
had
a
good
example
before
her
all
her
life
my
dear
mr
march
whispered
back
with
a
loving
look
at
the
worn
face
and
gray
head
beside
him
daisy
found
it
impossible
to
keep
her
eyes
off
her
pitty
aunty
but
attached
herself
like
a
lap-dog
to
the
wonderful
châtelaine
full
of
delightful
charms
demi
paused
to
consider
the
new
relationship
before
he
compromised
himself
by
the
rash
acceptance
of
a
bribe
which
took
the
tempting
form
of
a
family
of
wooden
bears
from
berne
a
flank
movement
produced
an
unconditional
surrender
however
for
laurie
knew
where
to
have
him
young
man
when
i
first
had
the
honor
of
making
your
acquaintance
you
hit
me
in
the
face
now
i
demand
the
satisfaction
of
a
gentleman
and
with
that
the
tall
uncle
proceeded
to
toss
and
tousle
the
small
nephew
in
a
way
that
damaged
his
philosophical
dignity
as
much
as
it
delighted
his
boyish
soul
illustration
the
tall
uncle
proceeded
to
toss
and
tousle
the
small
nephew
blest
if
she
ain't
in
silk
from
head
to
foot
ain't
it
a
relishin'
sight
to
see
her
settin'
there
as
fine
as
a
fiddle
and
hear
folks
calling
little
amy
mis
laurence
muttered
old
hannah
who
could
not
resist
frequent
peeks
through
the
slide
as
she
set
the
table
in
a
most
decidedly
promiscuous
manner
mercy
on
us
how
they
did
talk
first
one
then
the
other
then
all
burst
out
together
trying
to
tell
the
history
of
three
years
in
half
an
hour
it
was
fortunate
that
tea
was
at
hand
to
produce
a
lull
and
provide
refreshment
for
they
would
have
been
hoarse
and
faint
if
they
had
gone
on
much
longer
such
a
happy
procession
as
filed
away
into
the
little
dining-room
mr
march
proudly
escorted
mrs
laurence
mrs
march
as
proudly
leaned
on
the
arm
of
my
son
the
old
gentleman
took
jo
with
a
whispered
you
must
be
my
girl
now
and
a
glance
at
the
empty
corner
by
the
fire
that
made
jo
whisper
back
with
trembling
lips
i'll
try
to
fill
her
place
sir
the
twins
pranced
behind
feeling
that
the
millennium
was
at
hand
for
every
one
was
so
busy
with
the
new-comers
that
they
were
left
to
revel
at
their
own
sweet
will
and
you
may
be
sure
they
made
the
most
of
the
opportunity
didn't
they
steal
sips
of
tea
stuff
gingerbread
_ab
libitum_
get
a
hot
biscuit
apiece
and
as
a
crowning
trespass
didn't
they
each
whisk
a
captivating
little
tart
into
their
tiny
pockets
there
to
stick
and
crumble
treacherously
teaching
them
that
both
human
nature
and
pastry
are
frail
burdened
with
the
guilty
consciousness
of
the
sequestered
tarts
and
fearing
that
dodo's
sharp
eyes
would
pierce
the
thin
disguise
of
cambric
and
merino
which
hid
their
booty
the
little
sinners
attached
themselves
to
dranpa
who
hadn't
his
spectacles
on
amy
who
was
handed
about
like
refreshments
returned
to
the
parlor
on
father
laurence's
arm
the
others
paired
off
as
before
and
this
arrangement
left
jo
companionless
she
did
not
mind
it
at
the
minute
for
she
lingered
to
answer
hannah's
eager
inquiry,--
will
miss
amy
ride
in
her
coop
_coupé_
and
use
all
them
lovely
silver
dishes
that's
stored
away
over
yander
shouldn't
wonder
if
she
drove
six
white
horses
ate
off
gold
plate
and
wore
diamonds
and
point-lace
every
day
teddy
thinks
nothing
too
good
for
her
returned
jo
with
infinite
satisfaction
no
more
there
is
will
you
have
hash
or
fish-balls
for
breakfast
asked
hannah
who
wisely
mingled
poetry
and
prose
i
don't
care
and
jo
shut
the
door
feeling
that
food
was
an
uncongenial
topic
just
then
she
stood
a
minute
looking
at
the
party
vanishing
above
and
as
demi's
short
plaid
legs
toiled
up
the
last
stair
a
sudden
sense
of
loneliness
came
over
her
so
strongly
that
she
looked
about
her
with
dim
eyes
as
if
to
find
something
to
lean
upon
for
even
teddy
had
deserted
her
if
she
had
known
what
birthday
gift
was
coming
every
minute
nearer
and
nearer
she
would
not
have
said
to
herself
i'll
weep
a
little
weep
when
i
go
to
bed
it
won't
do
to
be
dismal
now
then
she
drew
her
hand
over
her
eyes,--for
one
of
her
boyish
habits
was
never
to
know
where
her
handkerchief
was,--and
had
just
managed
to
call
up
a
smile
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
porch-door
she
opened
it
with
hospitable
haste
and
started
as
if
another
ghost
had
come
to
surprise
her
for
there
stood
a
tall
bearded
gentleman
beaming
on
her
from
the
darkness
like
a
midnight
sun
o
mr
bhaer
i
_am_
so
glad
to
see
you
cried
jo
with
a
clutch
as
if
she
feared
the
night
would
swallow
him
up
before
she
could
get
him
in
illustration
o
mr
bhaer
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
and
i
to
see
miss
marsch,--but
no
you
haf
a
party--
and
the
professor
paused
as
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
tap
of
dancing
feet
came
down
to
them
no
we
haven't
only
the
family
my
sister
and
friends
have
just
come
home
and
we
are
all
very
happy
come
in
and
make
one
of
us
though
a
very
social
man
i
think
mr
bhaer
would
have
gone
decorously
away
and
come
again
another
day
but
how
could
he
when
jo
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
bereft
him
of
his
hat
perhaps
her
face
had
something
to
do
with
it
for
she
forgot
to
hide
her
joy
at
seeing
him
and
showed
it
with
a
frankness
that
proved
irresistible
to
the
solitary
man
whose
welcome
far
exceeded
his
boldest
hopes
if
i
shall
not
be
monsieur
de
trop
i
will
so
gladly
see
them
all
you
haf
been
ill
my
friend
he
put
the
question
abruptly
for
as
jo
hung
up
his
coat
the
light
fell
on
her
face
and
he
saw
a
change
in
it
not
ill
but
tired
and
sorrowful
we
have
had
trouble
since
i
saw
you
last
ah
yes
i
know
my
heart
was
sore
for
you
when
i
heard
that
and
he
shook
hands
again
with
such
a
sympathetic
face
that
jo
felt
as
if
no
comfort
could
equal
the
look
of
the
kind
eyes
the
grasp
of
the
big
warm
hand
father
mother
this
is
my
friend
professor
bhaer
she
said
with
a
face
and
tone
of
such
irrepressible
pride
and
pleasure
that
she
might
as
well
have
blown
a
trumpet
and
opened
the
door
with
a
flourish
if
the
stranger
had
had
any
doubts
about
his
reception
they
were
set
at
rest
in
a
minute
by
the
cordial
welcome
he
received
every
one
greeted
him
kindly
for
jo's
sake
at
first
but
very
soon
they
liked
him
for
his
own
they
could
not
help
it
for
he
carried
the
talisman
that
opens
all
hearts
and
these
simple
people
warmed
to
him
at
once
feeling
even
the
more
friendly
because
he
was
poor
for
poverty
enriches
those
who
live
above
it
and
is
a
sure
passport
to
truly
hospitable
spirits
mr
bhaer
sat
looking
about
him
with
the
air
of
a
traveller
who
knocks
at
a
strange
door
and
when
it
opens
finds
himself
at
home
the
children
went
to
him
like
bees
to
a
honey-pot
and
establishing
themselves
on
each
knee
proceeded
to
captivate
him
by
rifling
his
pockets
pulling
his
beard
and
investigating
his
watch
with
juvenile
audacity
the
women
telegraphed
their
approval
to
one
another
and
mr
march
feeling
that
he
had
got
a
kindred
spirit
opened
his
choicest
stores
for
his
guest's
benefit
while
silent
john
listened
and
enjoyed
the
talk
but
said
not
a
word
and
mr
laurence
found
it
impossible
to
go
to
sleep
if
jo
had
not
been
otherwise
engaged
laurie's
behavior
would
have
amused
her
for
a
faint
twinge
not
of
jealousy
but
something
like
suspicion
caused
that
gentleman
to
stand
aloof
at
first
and
observe
the
new-comer
with
brotherly
circumspection
but
it
did
not
last
long
he
got
interested
in
spite
of
himself
and
before
he
knew
it
was
drawn
into
the
circle
for
mr
bhaer
talked
well
in
this
genial
atmosphere
and
did
himself
justice
he
seldom
spoke
to
laurie
but
he
looked
at
him
often
and
a
shadow
would
pass
across
his
face
as
if
regretting
his
own
lost
youth
as
he
watched
the
young
man
in
his
prime
then
his
eye
would
turn
to
jo
so
wistfully
that
she
would
have
surely
answered
the
mute
inquiry
if
she
had
seen
it
but
jo
had
her
own
eyes
to
take
care
of
and
feeling
that
they
could
not
be
trusted
she
prudently
kept
them
on
the
little
sock
she
was
knitting
like
a
model
maiden
aunt
a
stealthy
glance
now
and
then
refreshed
her
like
sips
of
fresh
water
after
a
dusty
walk
for
the
sidelong
peeps
showed
her
several
propitious
omens
mr
bhaer's
face
had
lost
the
absent-minded
expression
and
looked
all
alive
with
interest
in
the
present
moment
actually
young
and
handsome
she
thought
forgetting
to
compare
him
with
laurie
as
she
usually
did
strange
men
to
their
great
detriment
then
he
seemed
quite
inspired
though
the
burial
customs
of
the
ancients
to
which
the
conversation
had
strayed
might
not
be
considered
an
exhilarating
topic
jo
quite
glowed
with
triumph
when
teddy
got
quenched
in
an
argument
and
thought
to
herself
as
she
watched
her
father's
absorbed
face
how
he
would
enjoy
having
such
a
man
as
my
professor
to
talk
with
every
day
lastly
mr
bhaer
was
dressed
in
a
new
suit
of
black
which
made
him
look
more
like
a
gentleman
than
ever
his
bushy
hair
had
been
cut
and
smoothly
brushed
but
didn't
stay
in
order
long
for
in
exciting
moments
he
rumpled
it
up
in
the
droll
way
he
used
to
do
and
jo
liked
it
rampantly
erect
better
than
flat
because
she
thought
it
gave
his
fine
forehead
a
jove-like
aspect
poor
jo
how
she
did
glorify
that
plain
man
as
she
sat
knitting
away
so
quietly
yet
letting
nothing
escape
her
not
even
the
fact
that
mr
bhaer
actually
had
gold
sleeve-buttons
in
his
immaculate
wristbands
dear
old
fellow
he
couldn't
have
got
himself
up
with
more
care
if
he'd
been
going
a-wooing
said
jo
to
herself
and
then
a
sudden
thought
born
of
the
words
made
her
blush
so
dreadfully
that
she
had
to
drop
her
ball
and
go
down
after
it
to
hide
her
face
the
manœuvre
did
not
succeed
as
well
as
she
expected
however
for
though
just
in
the
act
of
setting
fire
to
a
funeral-pile
the
professor
dropped
his
torch
metaphorically
speaking
and
made
a
dive
after
the
little
blue
ball
of
course
they
bumped
their
heads
smartly
together
saw
stars
and
both
came
up
flushed
and
laughing
without
the
ball
to
resume
their
seats
wishing
they
had
not
left
them
nobody
knew
where
the
evening
went
to
for
hannah
skilfully
abstracted
the
babies
at
an
early
hour
nodding
like
two
rosy
poppies
and
mr
laurence
went
home
to
rest
the
others
sat
round
the
fire
talking
away
utterly
regardless
of
the
lapse
of
time
till
meg
whose
maternal
mind
was
impressed
with
a
firm
conviction
that
daisy
had
tumbled
out
of
bed
and
demi
set
his
night-gown
afire
studying
the
structure
of
matches
made
a
move
to
go
we
must
have
our
sing
in
the
good
old
way
for
we
are
all
together
again
once
more
said
jo
feeling
that
a
good
shout
would
be
a
safe
and
pleasant
vent
for
the
jubilant
emotions
of
her
soul
they
were
not
_all_
there
but
no
one
found
the
words
thoughtless
or
untrue
for
beth
still
seemed
among
them
a
peaceful
presence
invisible
but
dearer
than
ever
since
death
could
not
break
the
household
league
that
love
made
indissoluble
the
little
chair
stood
in
its
old
place
the
tidy
basket
with
the
bit
of
work
she
left
unfinished
when
the
needle
grew
so
heavy
was
still
on
its
accustomed
shelf
the
beloved
instrument
seldom
touched
now
had
not
been
moved
and
above
it
beth's
face
serene
and
smiling
as
in
the
early
days
looked
down
upon
them
seeming
to
say
be
happy
i
am
here
play
something
amy
let
them
hear
how
much
you
have
improved
said
laurie
with
pardonable
pride
in
his
promising
pupil
but
amy
whispered
with
full
eyes
as
she
twirled
the
faded
stool,--
not
to-night
dear
i
can't
show
off
to-night
but
she
did
show
something
better
than
brilliancy
or
skill
for
she
sung
beth's
songs
with
a
tender
music
in
her
voice
which
the
best
master
could
not
have
taught
and
touched
the
listeners'
hearts
with
a
sweeter
power
than
any
other
inspiration
could
have
given
her
the
room
was
very
still
when
the
clear
voice
failed
suddenly
at
the
last
line
of
beth's
favorite
hymn
it
was
hard
to
say,--
earth
hath
no
sorrow
that
heaven
cannot
heal
and
amy
leaned
against
her
husband
who
stood
behind
her
feeling
that
her
welcome
home
was
not
quite
perfect
without
beth's
kiss
now
we
must
finish
with
mignon's
song
for
mr
bhaer
sings
that
said
jo
before
the
pause
grew
painful
and
mr
bhaer
cleared
his
throat
with
a
gratified
hem
as
he
stepped
into
the
corner
where
jo
stood
saying,--
you
will
sing
with
me
we
go
excellently
well
together
a
pleasing
fiction
by
the
way
for
jo
had
no
more
idea
of
music
than
a
grasshopper
but
she
would
have
consented
if
he
had
proposed
to
sing
a
whole
opera
and
warbled
away
blissfully
regardless
of
time
and
tune
it
didn't
much
matter
for
mr
bhaer
sang
like
a
true
german
heartily
and
well
and
jo
soon
subsided
into
a
subdued
hum
that
she
might
listen
to
the
mellow
voice
that
seemed
to
sing
for
her
alone
illustration
mr
bhaer
sang
heartily
know'st
thou
the
land
where
the
citron
blooms
used
to
be
the
professor's
favorite
line
for
das
land
meant
germany
to
him
but
now
he
seemed
to
dwell
with
peculiar
warmth
and
melody
upon
the
words,--
there
oh
there
might
i
with
thee
o
my
beloved
go
and
one
listener
was
so
thrilled
by
the
tender
invitation
that
she
longed
to
say
she
did
know
the
land
and
would
joyfully
depart
thither
whenever
he
liked
the
song
was
considered
a
great
success
and
the
singer
retired
covered
with
laurels
but
a
few
minutes
afterward
he
forgot
his
manners
entirely
and
stared
at
amy
putting
on
her
bonnet
for
she
had
been
introduced
simply
as
my
sister
and
no
one
had
called
her
by
her
new
name
since
he
came
he
forgot
himself
still
further
when
laurie
said
in
his
most
gracious
manner
at
parting,--
my
wife
and
i
are
very
glad
to
meet
you
sir
please
remember
that
there
is
always
a
welcome
waiting
for
you
over
the
way
then
the
professor
thanked
him
so
heartily
and
looked
so
suddenly
illuminated
with
satisfaction
that
laurie
thought
him
the
most
delightfully
demonstrative
old
fellow
he
ever
met
i
too
shall
go
but
i
shall
gladly
come
again
if
you
will
gif
me
leave
dear
madame
for
a
little
business
in
the
city
will
keep
me
here
some
days
he
spoke
to
mrs
march
but
he
looked
at
jo
and
the
mother's
voice
gave
as
cordial
an
assent
as
did
the
daughter's
eyes
for
mrs
march
was
not
so
blind
to
her
children's
interest
as
mrs
moffat
supposed
i
suspect
that
is
a
wise
man
remarked
mr
march
with
placid
satisfaction
from
the
hearth-rug
after
the
last
guest
had
gone
i
know
he
is
a
good
one
added
mrs
march
with
decided
approval
as
she
wound
up
the
clock
i
thought
you'd
like
him
was
all
jo
said
as
she
slipped
away
to
her
bed
she
wondered
what
the
business
was
that
brought
mr
bhaer
to
the
city
and
finally
decided
that
he
had
been
appointed
to
some
great
honor
somewhere
but
had
been
too
modest
to
mention
the
fact
if
she
had
seen
his
face
when
safe
in
his
own
room
he
looked
at
the
picture
of
a
severe
and
rigid
young
lady
with
a
good
deal
of
hair
who
appeared
to
be
gazing
darkly
into
futurity
it
might
have
thrown
some
light
upon
the
subject
especially
when
he
turned
off
the
gas
and
kissed
the
picture
in
the
dark
illustration
mrs
laurence
sitting
in
her
mother's
lap
xliv
my
lord
and
lady
please
madam
mother
could
you
lend
me
my
wife
for
half
an
hour
the
luggage
has
come
and
i've
been
making
hay
of
amy's
paris
finery
trying
to
find
some
things
i
want
said
laurie
coming
in
the
next
day
to
find
mrs
laurence
sitting
in
her
mother's
lap
as
if
being
made
the
baby
again
certainly
go
dear
i
forget
that
you
have
any
home
but
this
and
mrs
march
pressed
the
white
hand
that
wore
the
wedding-ring
as
if
asking
pardon
for
her
maternal
covetousness
i
shouldn't
have
come
over
if
i
could
have
helped
it
but
i
can't
get
on
without
my
little
woman
any
more
than
a--
weathercock
can
without
wind
suggested
jo
as
he
paused
for
a
simile
jo
had
grown
quite
her
own
saucy
self
again
since
teddy
came
home
exactly
for
amy
keeps
me
pointing
due
west
most
of
the
time
with
only
an
occasional
whiffle
round
to
the
south
and
i
haven't
had
an
easterly
spell
since
i
was
married
don't
know
anything
about
the
north
but
am
altogether
salubrious
and
balmy
hey
my
lady
lovely
weather
so
far
i
don't
know
how
long
it
will
last
but
i'm
not
afraid
of
storms
for
i'm
learning
how
to
sail
my
ship
come
home
dear
and
i'll
find
your
bootjack
i
suppose
that's
what
you
are
rummaging
after
among
my
things
men
are
_so_
helpless
mother
said
amy
with
a
matronly
air
which
delighted
her
husband
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourselves
after
you
get
settled
asked
jo
buttoning
amy's
cloak
as
she
used
to
button
her
pinafores
we
have
our
plans
we
don't
mean
to
say
much
about
them
yet
because
we
are
such
very
new
brooms
but
we
don't
intend
to
be
idle
i'm
going
into
business
with
a
devotion
that
shall
delight
grandfather
and
prove
to
him
that
i'm
not
spoilt
i
need
something
of
the
sort
to
keep
me
steady
i'm
tired
of
dawdling
and
mean
to
work
like
a
man
and
amy
what
is
she
going
to
do
asked
mrs
march
well
pleased
at
laurie's
decision
and
the
energy
with
which
he
spoke
after
doing
the
civil
all
round
and
airing
our
best
bonnet
we
shall
astonish
you
by
the
elegant
hospitalities
of
our
mansion
the
brilliant
society
we
shall
draw
about
us
and
the
beneficial
influence
we
shall
exert
over
the
world
at
large
that's
about
it
isn't
it
madame
récamier
asked
laurie
with
a
quizzical
look
at
amy
time
will
show
come
away
impertinence
and
don't
shock
my
family
by
calling
me
names
before
their
faces
answered
amy
resolving
that
there
should
be
a
home
with
a
good
wife
in
it
before
she
set
up
a
_salon_
as
a
queen
of
society
how
happy
those
children
seem
together
observed
mr
march
finding
it
difficult
to
become
absorbed
in
his
aristotle
after
the
young
couple
had
gone
yes
and
i
think
it
will
last
added
mrs
march
with
the
restful
expression
of
a
pilot
who
has
brought
a
ship
safely
into
port
i
know
it
will
happy
amy
and
jo
sighed
then
smiled
brightly
as
professor
bhaer
opened
the
gate
with
an
impatient
push
later
in
the
evening
when
his
mind
had
been
set
at
rest
about
the
bootjack
laurie
said
suddenly
to
his
wife
who
was
flitting
about
arranging
her
new
art
treasures,--
mrs
laurence
my
lord
that
man
intends
to
marry
our
jo
i
hope
so
don't
you
dear
well
my
love
i
consider
him
a
trump
in
the
fullest
sense
of
that
expressive
word
but
i
do
wish
he
was
a
little
younger
and
a
good
deal
richer
now
laurie
don't
be
too
fastidious
and
worldly-minded
if
they
love
one
another
it
doesn't
matter
a
particle
how
old
they
are
nor
how
poor
women
_never_
should
marry
for
money--
amy
caught
herself
up
short
as
the
words
escaped
her
and
looked
at
her
husband
who
replied
with
malicious
gravity,--
certainly
not
though
you
do
hear
charming
girls
say
that
they
intend
to
do
it
sometimes
if
my
memory
serves
me
you
once
thought
it
your
duty
to
make
a
rich
match
that
accounts
perhaps
for
your
marrying
a
good-for-nothing
like
me
o
my
dearest
boy
don't
don't
say
that
i
forgot
you
were
rich
when
i
said
'yes.'
i'd
have
married
you
if
you
hadn't
a
penny
and
i
sometimes
wish
you
_were_
poor
that
i
might
show
how
much
i
love
you
and
amy
who
was
very
dignified
in
public
and
very
fond
in
private
gave
convincing
proofs
of
the
truth
of
her
words
you
don't
really
think
i
am
such
a
mercenary
creature
as
i
tried
to
be
once
do
you
it
would
break
my
heart
if
you
didn't
believe
that
i'd
gladly
pull
in
the
same
boat
with
you
even
if
you
had
to
get
your
living
by
rowing
on
the
lake
am
i
an
idiot
and
a
brute
how
could
i
think
so
when
you
refused
a
richer
man
for
me
and
won't
let
me
give
you
half
i
want
to
now
when
i
have
the
right
girls
do
it
every
day
poor
things
and
are
taught
to
think
it
is
their
only
salvation
but
you
had
better
lessons
and
though
i
trembled
for
you
at
one
time
i
was
not
disappointed
for
the
daughter
was
true
to
the
mother's
teaching
i
told
mamma
so
yesterday
and
she
looked
as
glad
and
grateful
as
if
i'd
given
her
a
check
for
a
million
to
be
spent
in
charity
you
are
not
listening
to
my
moral
remarks
mrs
laurence
and
laurie
paused
for
amy's
eyes
had
an
absent
look
though
fixed
upon
his
face
yes
i
am
and
admiring
the
dimple
in
your
chin
at
the
same
time
i
don't
wish
to
make
you
vain
but
i
must
confess
that
i'm
prouder
of
my
handsome
husband
than
of
all
his
money
don't
laugh
but
your
nose
is
_such_
a
comfort
to
me
and
amy
softly
caressed
the
well-cut
feature
with
artistic
satisfaction
laurie
had
received
many
compliments
in
his
life
but
never
one
that
suited
him
better
as
he
plainly
showed
though
he
did
laugh
at
his
wife's
peculiar
taste
while
she
said
slowly,--
may
i
ask
you
a
question
dear
of
course
you
may
shall
you
care
if
jo
does
marry
mr
bhaer
oh
that's
the
trouble
is
it
i
thought
there
was
something
in
the
dimple
that
didn't
suit
you
not
being
a
dog
in
the
manger
but
the
happiest
fellow
alive
i
assure
you
i
can
dance
at
jo's
wedding
with
a
heart
as
light
as
my
heels
do
you
doubt
it
my
darling
amy
looked
up
at
him
and
was
satisfied
her
last
little
jealous
fear
vanished
forever
and
she
thanked
him
with
a
face
full
of
love
and
confidence
i
wish
we
could
do
something
for
that
capital
old
professor
couldn't
we
invent
a
rich
relation
who
shall
obligingly
die
out
there
in
germany
and
leave
him
a
tidy
little
fortune
said
laurie
when
they
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
long
drawing-room
arm-in-arm
as
they
were
fond
of
doing
in
memory
of
the
chateau
garden
illustration
they
began
to
pace
up
and
down
jo
would
find
us
out
and
spoil
it
all
she
is
very
proud
of
him
just
as
he
is
and
said
yesterday
that
she
thought
poverty
was
a
beautiful
thing
bless
her
dear
heart
she
won't
think
so
when
she
has
a
literary
husband
and
a
dozen
little
professors
and
professorins
to
support
we
won't
interfere
now
but
watch
our
chance
and
do
them
a
good
turn
in
spite
of
themselves
i
owe
jo
for
a
part
of
my
education
and
she
believes
in
people's
paying
their
honest
debts
so
i'll
get
round
her
in
that
way
how
delightful
it
is
to
be
able
to
help
others
isn't
it
that
was
always
one
of
my
dreams
to
have
the
power
of
giving
freely
and
thanks
to
you
the
dream
has
come
true
ah
we'll
do
quantities
of
good
won't
we
there's
one
sort
of
poverty
that
i
particularly
like
to
help
out-and-out
beggars
get
taken
care
of
but
poor
gentlefolks
fare
badly
because
they
won't
ask
and
people
don't
dare
to
offer
charity
yet
there
are
a
thousand
ways
of
helping
them
if
one
only
knows
how
to
do
it
so
delicately
that
it
does
not
offend
i
must
say
i
like
to
serve
a
decayed
gentleman
better
than
a
blarneying
beggar
i
suppose
it's
wrong
but
i
do
though
it
is
harder
because
it
takes
a
gentleman
to
do
it
added
the
other
member
of
the
domestic
admiration
society
thank
you
i'm
afraid
i
don't
deserve
that
pretty
compliment
but
i
was
going
to
say
that
while
i
was
dawdling
about
abroad
i
saw
a
good
many
talented
young
fellows
making
all
sorts
of
sacrifices
and
enduring
real
hardships
that
they
might
realize
their
dreams
splendid
fellows
some
of
them
working
like
heroes
poor
and
friendless
but
so
full
of
courage
patience
and
ambition
that
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
and
longed
to
give
them
a
right
good
lift
those
are
people
whom
it's
a
satisfaction
to
help
for
if
they've
got
genius
it's
an
honor
to
be
allowed
to
serve
them
and
not
let
it
be
lost
or
delayed
for
want
of
fuel
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
if
they
haven't
it's
a
pleasure
to
comfort
the
poor
souls
and
keep
them
from
despair
when
they
find
it
out
yes
indeed
and
there's
another
class
who
can't
ask
and
who
suffer
in
silence
i
know
something
of
it
for
i
belonged
to
it
before
you
made
a
princess
of
me
as
the
king
does
the
beggar-maid
in
the
old
story
ambitious
girls
have
a
hard
time
laurie
and
often
have
to
see
youth
health
and
precious
opportunities
go
by
just
for
want
of
a
little
help
at
the
right
minute
people
have
been
very
kind
to
me
and
whenever
i
see
girls
struggling
along
as
we
used
to
do
i
want
to
put
out
my
hand
and
help
them
as
i
was
helped
and
so
you
shall
like
an
angel
as
you
are
cried
laurie
resolving
with
a
glow
of
philanthropic
zeal
to
found
and
endow
an
institution
for
the
express
benefit
of
young
women
with
artistic
tendencies
rich
people
have
no
right
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
themselves
or
let
their
money
accumulate
for
others
to
waste
it's
not
half
so
sensible
to
leave
legacies
when
one
dies
as
it
is
to
use
the
money
wisely
while
alive
and
enjoy
making
one's
fellow-creatures
happy
with
it
we'll
have
a
good
time
ourselves
and
add
an
extra
relish
to
our
own
pleasure
by
giving
other
people
a
generous
taste
will
you
be
a
little
dorcas
going
about
emptying
a
big
basket
of
comforts
and
filling
it
up
with
good
deeds
with
all
my
heart
if
you
will
be
a
brave
st
martin
stopping
as
you
ride
gallantly
through
the
world
to
share
your
cloak
with
the
beggar
it's
a
bargain
and
we
shall
get
the
best
of
it
so
the
young
pair
shook
hands
upon
it
and
then
paced
happily
on
again
feeling
that
their
pleasant
home
was
more
home-like
because
they
hoped
to
brighten
other
homes
believing
that
their
own
feet
would
walk
more
uprightly
along
the
flowery
path
before
them
if
they
smoothed
rough
ways
for
other
feet
and
feeling
that
their
hearts
were
more
closely
knit
together
by
a
love
which
could
tenderly
remember
those
less
blest
than
they
illustration

i

historian
of
the
march
family
without
devoting
at
least
one
chapter
to
the
two
most
precious
and
important
members
of
it
daisy
and
demi
had
now
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
for
in
this
fast
age
babies
of
three
or
four
assert
their
rights
and
get
them
too
which
is
more
than
many
of
their
elders
do
if
there
ever
were
a
pair
of
twins
in
danger
of
being
utterly
spoilt
by
adoration
it
was
these
prattling
brookes
of
course
they
were
the
most
remarkable
children
ever
born
as
will
be
shown
when
i
mention
that
they
walked
at
eight
months
talked
fluently
at
twelve
months
and
at
two
years
they
took
their
places
at
table
and
behaved
with
a
propriety
which
charmed
all
beholders
at
three
daisy
demanded
a
needler
and
actually
made
a
bag
with
four
stitches
in
it
she
likewise
set
up
housekeeping
in
the
sideboard
and
managed
a
microscopic
cooking-stove
with
a
skill
that
brought
tears
of
pride
to
hannah's
eyes
while
demi
learned
his
letters
with
his
grandfather
who
invented
a
new
mode
of
teaching
the
alphabet
by
forming
the
letters
with
his
arms
and
legs
thus
uniting
gymnastics
for
head
and
heels
the
boy
early
developed
a
mechanical
genius
which
delighted
his
father
and
distracted
his
mother
for
he
tried
to
imitate
every
machine
he
saw
and
kept
the
nursery
in
a
chaotic
condition
with
his
sewin-sheen,"--a
mysterious
structure
of
string
chairs
clothes-pins
and
spools
for
wheels
to
go
wound
and
wound
also
a
basket
hung
over
the
back
of
a
big
chair
in
which
he
vainly
tried
to
hoist
his
too
confiding
sister
who
with
feminine
devotion
allowed
her
little
head
to
be
bumped
till
rescued
when
the
young
inventor
indignantly
remarked
why
marmar
dat's
my
lellywaiter
and
me's
trying
to
pull
her
up
though
utterly
unlike
in
character
the
twins
got
on
remarkably
well
together
and
seldom
quarrelled
more
than
thrice
a
day
of
course
demi
tyrannized
over
daisy
and
gallantly
defended
her
from
every
other
aggressor
while
daisy
made
a
galley-slave
of
herself
and
adored
her
brother
as
the
one
perfect
being
in
the
world
a
rosy
chubby
sunshiny
little
soul
was
daisy
who
found
her
way
to
everybody's
heart
and
nestled
there
one
of
the
captivating
children
who
seem
made
to
be
kissed
and
cuddled
adorned
and
adored
like
little
goddesses
and
produced
for
general
approval
on
all
festive
occasions
her
small
virtues
were
so
sweet
that
she
would
have
been
quite
angelic
if
a
few
small
naughtinesses
had
not
kept
her
delightfully
human
it
was
all
fair
weather
in
her
world
and
every
morning
she
scrambled
up
to
the
window
in
her
little
night-gown
to
look
out
and
say
no
matter
whether
it
rained
or
shone
oh
pitty
day
oh
pitty
day
every
one
was
a
friend
and
she
offered
kisses
to
a
stranger
so
confidingly
that
the
most
inveterate
bachelor
relented
and
baby-lovers
became
faithful
worshippers

she
once
said
opening
her
arms
with
her
spoon
in
one
hand
and
her
mug
in
the
other
as
if
eager
to
embrace
and
nourish
the
whole
world
as
she
grew
her
mother
began
to
feel
that
the
dove-cote
would
be
blest
by
the
presence
of
an
inmate
as
serene
and
loving
as
that
which
had
helped
to
make
the
old
house
home
and
to
pray
that
she
might
be
spared
a
loss
like
that
which
had
lately
taught
them
how
long
they
had
entertained
an
angel
unawares
her
grandfather
often
called
her
beth
and
her
grandmother
watched
over
her
with
untiring
devotion
as
if
trying
to
atone
for
some
past
mistake
which
no
eye
but
her
own
could
see
demi
like
a
true
yankee
was
of
an
inquiring
turn
wanting
to
know
everything
and
often
getting
much
disturbed
because
he
could
not
get
satisfactory
answers
to
his
perpetual
what
for
he
also
possessed
a
philosophic
bent
to
the
great
delight
of
his
grandfather
who
used
to
hold
socratic
conversations
with
him
in
which
the
precocious
pupil
occasionally
posed
his
teacher
to
the
undisguised
satisfaction
of
the
womenfolk

the
young
philosopher
surveying
those
active
portions
of
his
frame
with
a
meditative
air
while
resting
after
a
go-to-bed
frolic
one
night
it's
your
little

replied
the
sage
stroking
the
yellow
head
respectfully
what
is
a
little
mine
it
is
something
which
makes
your
body
move
as

i
can't
show
you
how
for
it
is
done

demi
felt
of
his
back
as
if
expecting
to
find
it
like
that
of
the
watch
and
then
gravely
remarked,--
i
dess
dod
does
it
when
i's
asleep
a
careful
explanation
followed
to
which
he
listened
so
attentively
that
his
anxious
grandmother
said,--
my
dear
do
you
think
it
wise
to
talk
about
such
things
to
that
baby
he's
getting
great
bumps
over
his
eyes
and
learning
to
ask
the
most
unanswerable
questions
if
he
is
old
enough
to
ask
the
questions
he
is
old
enough
to
receive
true
answers
i
am
not
putting
the
thoughts
into
his
head
but
helping
him
unfold
those
already
there
these
children
are
wiser
than
we
are
and
i
have
no
doubt
the
boy
understands
every
word
i
have
said
to
him
now
demi
tell
me
where
you
keep
your
mind
if
the
boy
had
replied
like
alcibiades
by
the
gods
socrates
i
cannot
tell
his
grandfather
would
not
have
been
surprised
but
when
after
standing
a
moment
on
one
leg
like
a
meditative
young
stork
he
answered
in
a
tone
of
calm
conviction
in
my
little
belly
the
old
gentleman
could
only
join
in
grandma's
laugh
and
dismiss
the
class
in
metaphysics
there
might
have
been
cause
for
maternal
anxiety
if
demi
had
not
given
convincing
proofs
that
he
was
a
true
boy
as
well
as
a
budding
philosopher
for
often
after
a
discussion
which
caused
hannah
to
prophesy
with
ominous
nods
that
child
ain't
long
for
this
world
he
would
turn
about
and
set
her
fears
at
rest
by
some
of
the
pranks
with
which
dear
dirty
naughty
little
rascals
distract
and
delight
their
parents'
souls
meg
made
many
moral
rules
and
tried
to
keep
them
but
what

was
ever
proof
against
the
winning
wiles

ingenious
evasions

tranquil
audacity

aunt
dodo
was
chief
playmate
and
_confidante_
of
both
children

the
trio
turned
the
little
house
topsy-turvy
aunt
amy
was
as
yet
only
a
name
to
them
aunt
beth
soon
faded
into
a
pleasantly
vague
memory
but
aunt
dodo
was
a
living
reality
and
they
made
the
most
of
her
for
which
compliment
she
was
deeply
grateful
but
when
mr
bhaer
came
jo
neglected
her
playfellows
and
dismay
and
desolation
fell
upon
their
little
souls
daisy
who
was
fond
of
going
about
peddling
kisses
lost
her
best
customer
and
became
bankrupt
demi
with
infantile
penetration
soon
discovered
that
dodo
liked
to
play
with
the
bear-man
better
than
she
did
with
him
but
though
hurt
he
concealed
his
anguish
for
he
hadn't
the
heart
to
insult
a
rival
who
kept
a
mine
of
chocolate-drops
in
his
waistcoat-pocket
and
a
watch
that
could
be
taken
out
of
its
case
and
freely
shaken
by
ardent
admirers
some
persons
might
have
considered
these
pleasing
liberties
as
bribes
but
demi
didn't
see
it
in
that
light
and
continued
to
patronize
the
bear-man
with
pensive
affability
while
daisy
bestowed
her
small
affections
upon
him
at
the
third
call
and
considered
his
shoulder
her
throne
his
arm
her
refuge
his
gifts
treasures
of
surpassing
worth
gentlemen
are
sometimes
seized
with
sudden
fits
of
admiration
for
the
young
relatives
of
ladies
whom
they
honor
with
their
regard
but
this
counterfeit
philoprogenitiveness
sits
uneasily
upon
them
and
does
not
deceive
anybody
a
particle
mr
bhaer's
devotion
was
sincere
however
likewise
effective,--for
honesty
is
the
best
policy
in
love
as
in
law
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
are
at
home
with
children
and
looked
particularly
well
when
little
faces
made
a
pleasant
contrast
with
his
manly
one
his
business
whatever
it
was
detained
him
from
day
to
day
but
evening
seldom
failed
to
bring
him
out
to
see--well
he
always
asked
for
mr
march
so
i
suppose
_he_
was
the
attraction
the
excellent
papa
labored
under
the
delusion
that
he
was
and
revelled
in
long
discussions
with
the
kindred
spirit
till
a
chance
remark
of
his
more
observing
grandson
suddenly
enlightened
him
mr
bhaer
came
in
one
evening
to
pause
on
the
threshold
of
the
study
astonished
by
the
spectacle
that
met
his
eye
prone
upon
the
floor
lay
mr
march
with
his
respectable
legs
in
the
air
and
beside
him
likewise
prone
was
demi
trying
to
imitate
the
attitude
with
his
own
short
scarlet-stockinged
legs
both
grovellers
so
seriously
absorbed
that
they
were
unconscious
of
spectators
till
mr
bhaer
laughed
his
sonorous
laugh
and
jo
cried
out
with
a
scandalized
face,--
father

here's
the
professor
down
went
the
black
legs
and
up
came
the
gray
head
as
the
preceptor
said
with
undisturbed
dignity,--

after
a
few
convulsive
efforts
the
red
legs
took
the

of

triumphantly
shouted

jo
as
her
parent
gathered
himself
up
and
her
nephew
tried
to
stand
on
his
head
as
the
only
mode
of
expressing
his
satisfaction
that
school
was
over

mr

continuing
to
confess
the
young

upon

knee

full

his
tongue

shouldst
save
some
for
the
little
friend

mr
bhaer
offered
jo
some
with
a
look
that
made
her
wonder
if
chocolate
was
not
the
nectar
drunk
by
the
gods
demi
also
saw
the
smile
was
impressed
by
it
and
artlessly
inquired,--

'fessor

mr
bhaer
couldn't
tell
a
lie
so
he
gave
the
somewhat
vague
reply
that
he
believed
they
did
sometimes
in
a
tone
that
made
mr
march
put
down
his
clothes-brush
glance
at
jo's
retiring
face
and
then
sink
into
his
chair
looking
as
if
the
precocious
chick
had
put
an
idea
into
_his_
head
that
was
both
sweet
and
sour

dodo
when
she
caught
him
in
the
china-closet
half
an
hour
afterward
nearly
squeezed
the
breath
out
of
his
little
body
with
a
tender
embrace
instead
of
shaking
him
for
being
there
and
why
she
followed
up
this
novel
performance
by
the
unexpected
gift
of
a
big
slice
of
bread
and
jelly
remained
one
of

problems

come
when
he
could
give
jo
a
piece
of
plate
with
a
bear
and
a
ragged
staff
on
it
as
an
appropriate
coat-of-arms
for
a
fortnight
the
professor
came
and
went
with
lover-like
regularity
then
he
stayed
away
for
three
whole
days
and
made
no
sign,--a
proceeding
which
caused
everybody
to
look
sober
and
jo
to
become
pensive
at
first
and
then--alas
for
romance!--very
cross
disgusted
i
dare
say
and
gone
home
as
suddenly
as
he
came
it's
nothing
to
me
of
course
but
i
_should_
think
he
would
have
come
and
bid
us
good-by
like
a
gentleman
she
said
to
herself
with
a
despairing
look
at
the
gate
as
she
put
on
her
things
for
the
customary
walk
one
dull
afternoon
you'd
better
take
the
little
umbrella
dear
it
looks
like
rain
said
her
mother
observing
that
she
had
on
her
new
bonnet
but
not
alluding
to
the
fact
yes
marmee
do
you
want
anything
in
town
i've
got
to
run
in
and
get
some
paper
returned
jo
pulling
out
the
bow
under
her
chin
before
the
glass
as
an
excuse
for
not
looking
at
her
mother
yes
i
want
some
twilled
silesia
a
paper
of
number
nine
needles
and
two
yards
of
narrow
lavender
ribbon
have
you
got
your
thick
boots
on
and
something
warm
under
your
cloak
i
believe
so
answered
jo
absently
if
you
happen
to
meet
mr
bhaer
bring
him
home
to
tea
i
quite
long
to
see
the
dear
man
added
mrs
march
jo
heard
_that_
but
made
no
answer
except
to
kiss
her
mother
and
walk
rapidly
away
thinking
with
a
glow
of
gratitude
in
spite
of
her
heartache,--
how
good
she
is
to
me
what
_do_
girls
do
who
haven't
any
mothers
to
help
them
through
their
troubles
the
dry-goods
stores
were
not
down
among
the
counting-houses
banks
and
wholesale
warerooms
where
gentlemen
most
do
congregate
but
jo
found
herself
in
that
part
of
the
city
before
she
did
a
single
errand
loitering
along
as
if
waiting
for
some
one
examining
engineering
instruments
in
one
window
and
samples
of
wool
in
another
with
most
unfeminine
interest
tumbling
over
barrels
being
half-smothered
by
descending
bales
and
hustled
unceremoniously
by
busy
men
who
looked
as
if
they
wondered
how
the
deuce
she
got
there
a
drop
of
rain
on
her
cheek
recalled
her
thoughts
from
baffled
hopes
to
ruined
ribbons
for
the
drops
continued
to
fall
and
being
a
woman
as
well
as
a
lover
she
felt
that
though
it
was
too
late
to
save
her
heart
she
might
her
bonnet
now
she
remembered
the
little
umbrella
which
she
had
forgotten
to
take
in
her
hurry
to
be
off
but
regret
was
unavailing
and
nothing
could
be
done
but
borrow
one
or
submit
to
a
drenching
she
looked
up
at
the
lowering
sky
down
at
the
crimson
bow
already
flecked
with
black
forward
along
the
muddy
street
then
one
long
lingering
look
behind
at
a
certain
grimy
warehouse
with
hoffmann
swartz
&
co
over
the
door
and
said
to
herself
with
a
sternly
reproachful
air,--
it
serves
me
right
what
business
had
i
to
put
on
all
my
best
things
and
come
philandering
down
here
hoping
to
see
the
professor
jo
i'm
ashamed
of
you
no
you
shall
_not_
go
there
to
borrow
an
umbrella
or
find
out
where
he
is
from
his
friends
you
shall
trudge
away
and
do
your
errands
in
the
rain
and
if
you
catch
your
death
and
ruin
your
bonnet
it's
no
more
than
you
deserve
now
then
with
that
she
rushed
across
the
street
so
impetuously
that
she
narrowly
escaped
annihilation
from
a
passing
truck
and
precipitated
herself
into
the
arms
of
a
stately
old
gentleman
who
said
i
beg
pardon
ma'am
and
looked
mortally
offended
somewhat
daunted
jo
righted
herself
spread
her
handkerchief
over
the
devoted
ribbons
and
putting
temptation
behind
her
hurried
on
with
increasing
dampness
about
the
ankles
and
much
clashing
of
umbrellas
overhead
the
fact
that
a
somewhat
dilapidated
blue
one
remained
stationary
above
the
unprotected
bonnet
attracted
her
attention
and
looking
up
she
saw
mr
bhaer
looking
down
illustration
looking
up
she
saw
mr
bhaer
i
feel
to
know
the
strong-minded
lady
who
goes
so
bravely
under
many
horse-noses
and
so
fast
through
much
mud
what
do
you
down
here
my
friend
i'm
shopping
mr
bhaer
smiled
as
he
glanced
from
the
pickle-factory
on
one
side
to
the
wholesale
hide
and
leather
concern
on
the
other
but
he
only
said
politely,--
you
haf
no
umbrella
may
i
go
also
and
take
for
you
the
bundles
yes
thank
you
jo's
cheeks
were
as
red
as
her
ribbon
and
she
wondered
what
he
thought
of
her
but
she
didn't
care
for
in
a
minute
she
found
herself
walking
away
arm-in-arm
with
her
professor
feeling
as
if
the
sun
had
suddenly
burst
out
with
uncommon
brilliancy
that
the
world
was
all
right
again
and
that
one
thoroughly
happy
woman
was
paddling
through
the
wet
that
day
we
thought
you
had
gone
said
jo
hastily
for
she
knew
he
was
looking
at
her
her
bonnet
wasn't
big
enough
to
hide
her
face
and
she
feared
he
might
think
the
joy
it
betrayed
unmaidenly
did
you
believe
that
i
should
go
with
no
farewell
to
those
who
haf
been
so
heavenly
kind
to
me
he
asked
so
reproachfully
that
she
felt
as
if
she
had
insulted
him
by
the
suggestion
and
answered
heartily,--
no
_i_
didn't
i
knew
you
were
busy
about
your
own
affairs
but
we
rather
missed
you,--father
and
mother
especially
and
you
i'm
always
glad
to
see
you
sir
in
her
anxiety
to
keep
her
voice
quite
calm
jo
made
it
rather
cool
and
the
frosty
little
monosyllable
at
the
end
seemed
to
chill
the
professor
for
his
smile
vanished
as
he
said
gravely,--
i
thank
you
and
come
one
time
more
before
i
go
you
_are_
going
then
i
haf
no
longer
any
business
here
it
is
done
successfully
i
hope
said
jo
for
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
was
in
that
short
reply
of
his
i
ought
to
think
so
for
i
haf
a
way
opened
to
me
by
which
i
can
make
my
bread
and
gif
my
jünglings
much
help
tell
me
please
i
like
to
know
all
about
the--the
boys
said
jo
eagerly
that
is
so
kind
i
gladly
tell
you
my
friends
find
for
me
a
place
in
a
college
where
i
teach
as
at
home
and
earn
enough
to
make
the
way
smooth
for
franz
and
emil
for
this
i
should
be
grateful
should
i
not
indeed
you
should
how
splendid
it
will
be
to
have
you
doing
what
you
like
and
be
able
to
see
you
often
and
the
boys
cried
jo
clinging
to
the
lads
as
an
excuse
for
the
satisfaction
she
could
not
help
betraying
ah
but
we
shall
not
meet
often
i
fear
this
place
is
at
the
west
so
far
away
and
jo
left
her
skirts
to
their
fate
as
if
it
didn't
matter
now
what
became
of
her
clothes
or
herself
mr
bhaer
could
read
several
languages
but
he
had
not
learned
to
read
women
yet
he
flattered
himself
that
he
knew
jo
pretty
well
and
was
therefore
much
amazed
by
the
contradictions
of
voice
face
and
manner
which
she
showed
him
in
rapid
succession
that
day
for
she
was
in
half
a
dozen
different
moods
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
when
she
met
him
she
looked
surprised
though
it
was
impossible
to
help
suspecting
that
she
had
come
for
that
express
purpose
when
he
offered
her
his
arm
she
took
it
with
a
look
that
filled
him
with
delight
but
when
he
asked
if
she
missed
him
she
gave
such
a
chilly
formal
reply
that
despair
fell
upon
him
on
learning
his
good
fortune
she
almost
clapped
her
hands
was
the
joy
all
for
the
boys
then
on
hearing
his
destination
she
said
so
far
away
in
a
tone
of
despair
that
lifted
him
on
to
a
pinnacle
of
hope
but
the
next
minute
she
tumbled
him
down
again
by
observing
like
one
entirely
absorbed
in
the
matter,--
here's
the
place
for
my
errands
will
you
come
in
it
won't
take
long
jo
rather
prided
herself
upon
her
shopping
capabilities
and
particularly
wished
to
impress
her
escort
with
the
neatness
and
despatch
with
which
she
would
accomplish
the
business
but
owing
to
the
flutter
she
was
in
everything
went
amiss
she
upset
the
tray
of
needles
forgot
the
silesia
was
to
be
twilled
till
it
was
cut
off
gave
the
wrong
change
and
covered
herself
with
confusion
by
asking
for
lavender
ribbon
at
the
calico
counter
mr
bhaer
stood
by
watching
her
blush
and
blunder
and
as
he
watched
his
own
bewilderment
seemed
to
subside
for
he
was
beginning
to
see
that
on
some
occasions
women
like
dreams
go
by
contraries
when
they
came
out
he
put
the
parcel
under
his
arm
with
a
more
cheerful
aspect
and
splashed
through
the
puddles
as
if
he
rather
enjoyed
it
on
the
whole
should
we
not
do
a
little
what
you
call
shopping
for
the
babies
and
haf
a
farewell
feast
to-night
if
i
go
for
my
last
call
at
your
so
pleasant
home
he
asked
stopping
before
a
window
full
of
fruit
and
flowers
what
will
we
buy
said
jo
ignoring
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
and
sniffing
the
mingled
odors
with
an
affectation
of
delight
as
they
went
in
may
they
haf
oranges
and
figs
asked
mr
bhaer
with
a
paternal
air
they
eat
them
when
they
can
get
them
do
you
care
for
nuts
like
a
squirrel
hamburg
grapes
yes
we
shall
surely
drink
to
the
fatherland
in
those
jo
frowned
upon
that
piece
of
extravagance
and
asked
why
he
didn't
buy
a
frail
of
dates
a
cask
of
raisins
and
a
bag
of
almonds
and
done
with
it
whereat
mr
bhaer
confiscated
her
purse
produced
his
own
and
finished
the
marketing
by
buying
several
pounds
of
grapes
a
pot
of
rosy
daisies
and
a
pretty
jar
of
honey
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
demijohn
then
distorting
his
pockets
with
the
knobby
bundles
and
giving
her
the
flowers
to
hold
he
put
up
the
old
umbrella
and
they
travelled
on
again
miss
marsch
i
haf
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you
began
the
professor
after
a
moist
promenade
of
half
a
block
yes
sir
and
jo's
heart
began
to
beat
so
hard
she
was
afraid
he
would
hear
it
i
am
bold
to
say
it
in
spite
of
the
rain
because
so
short
a
time
remains
to
me
yes
sir
and
jo
nearly
crushed
the
small
flower-pot
with
the
sudden
squeeze
she
gave
it
i
wish
to
get
a
little
dress
for
my
tina
and
i
am
too
stupid
to
go
alone
will
you
kindly
gif
me
a
word
of
taste
and
help
yes
sir
and
jo
felt
as
calm
and
cool
all
of
a
sudden
as
if
she
had
stepped
into
a
refrigerator
perhaps
also
a
shawl
for
tina's
mother
she
is
so
poor
and
sick
and
the
husband
is
such
a
care
yes
yes
a
thick
warm
shawl
would
be
a
friendly
thing
to
take
the
little
mother
i'll
do
it
with
pleasure
mr
bhaer
i'm
going
very
fast
and
he's
getting
dearer
every
minute
added
jo
to
herself
then
with
a
mental
shake
she
entered
into
the
business
with
an
energy
which
was
pleasant
to
behold
mr
bhaer
left
it
all
to
her
so
she
chose
a
pretty
gown
for
tina
and
then
ordered
out
the
shawls
the
clerk
being
a
married
man
condescended
to
take
an
interest
in
the
couple
who
appeared
to
be
shopping
for
their
family
your
lady
may
prefer
this
it's
a
superior
article
a
most
desirable
color
quite
chaste
and
genteel
he
said
shaking
out
a
comfortable
gray
shawl
and
throwing
it
over
jo's
shoulders
illustration
does
this
suit
you
mr
bhaer
does
this
suit
you
mr
bhaer
she
asked
turning
her
back
to
him
and
feeling
deeply
grateful
for
the
chance
of
hiding
her
face
excellently
well
we
will
haf
it
answered
the
professor
smiling
to
himself
as
he
paid
for
it
while
jo
continued
to
rummage
the
counters
like
a
confirmed
bargain-hunter
now
shall
we
go
home
he
asked
as
if
the
words
were
very
pleasant
to
him
yes
it's
late
and
i'm
_so_
tired
jo's
voice
was
more
pathetic
than
she
knew
for
now
the
sun
seemed
to
have
gone
in
as
suddenly
as
it
came
out
the
world
grew
muddy
and
miserable
again
and
for
the
first
time
she
discovered
that
her
feet
were
cold
her
head
ached
and
that
her
heart
was
colder
than
the
former
fuller
of
pain
than
the
latter
mr
bhaer
was
going
away
he
only
cared
for
her
as
a
friend
it
was
all
a
mistake
and
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
better
with
this
idea
in
her
head
she
hailed
an
approaching
omnibus
with
such
a
hasty
gesture
that
the
daisies
flew
out
of
the
pot
and
were
badly
damaged
this
is
not
our
omniboos
said
the
professor
waving
the
loaded
vehicle
away
and
stopping
to
pick
up
the
poor
little
flowers
i
beg
your
pardon
i
didn't
see
the
name
distinctly
never
mind
i
can
walk
i'm
used
to
plodding
in
the
mud
returned
jo
winking
hard
because
she
would
have
died
rather
than
openly
wipe
her
eyes
mr
bhaer
saw
the
drops
on
her
cheeks
though
she
turned
her
head
away
the
sight
seemed
to
touch
him
very
much
for
suddenly
stooping
down
he
asked
in
a
tone
that
meant
a
great
deal,--
heart's
dearest
why
do
you
cry
now
if
jo
had
not
been
new
to
this
sort
of
thing
she
would
have
said
she
wasn't
crying
had
a
cold
in
her
head
or
told
any
other
feminine
fib
proper
to
the
occasion
instead
of
which
that
undignified
creature
answered
with
an
irrepressible
sob,--
because
you
are
going
away
ach
mein
gott
that
is
_so_
good
cried
mr
bhaer
managing
to
clasp
his
hands
in
spite
of
the
umbrella
and
the
bundles
jo
i
haf
nothing
but
much
love
to
gif
you
i
came
to
see
if
you
could
care
for
it
and
i
waited
to
be
sure
that
i
was
something
more
than
a
friend
am
i
can
you
make
a
little
place
in
your
heart
for
old
fritz
he
added
all
in
one
breath
oh
yes
said
jo
and
he
was
quite
satisfied
for
she
folded
both
hands
over
his
arm
and
looked
up
at
him
with
an
expression
that
plainly
showed
how
happy
she
would
be
to
walk
through
life
beside
him
even
though
she
had
no
better
shelter
than
the
old
umbrella
if
he
carried
it
it
was
certainly
proposing
under
difficulties
for
even
if
he
had
desired
to
do
so
mr
bhaer
could
not
go
down
upon
his
knees
on
account
of
the
mud
neither
could
he
offer
jo
his
hand
except
figuratively
for
both
were
full
much
less
could
he
indulge
in
tender
demonstrations
in
the
open
street
though
he
was
near
it
so
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
express
his
rapture
was
to
look
at
her
with
an
expression
which
glorified
his
face
to
such
a
degree
that
there
actually
seemed
to
be
little
rainbows
in
the
drops
that
sparkled
on
his
beard
if
he
had
not
loved
jo
very
much
i
don't
think
he
could
have
done
it
_then_
for
she
looked
far
from
lovely
with
her
skirts
in
a
deplorable
state
her
rubber
boots
splashed
to
the
ankle
and
her
bonnet
a
ruin
fortunately
mr
bhaer
considered
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
living
and
she
found
him
more
jove-like
than
ever
though
his
hat-brim
was
quite
limp
with
the
little
rills
trickling
thence
upon
his
shoulders
for
he
held
the
umbrella
all
over
jo
and
every
finger
of
his
gloves
needed
mending
passers-by
probably
thought
them
a
pair
of
harmless
lunatics
for
they
entirely
forgot
to
hail
a
'bus
and
strolled
leisurely
along
oblivious
of
deepening
dusk
and
fog
little
they
cared
what
anybody
thought
for
they
were
enjoying
the
happy
hour
that
seldom
comes
but
once
in
any
life
the
magical
moment
which
bestows
youth
on
the
old
beauty
on
the
plain
wealth
on
the
poor
and
gives
human
hearts
a
foretaste
of
heaven
the
professor
looked
as
if
he
had
conquered
a
kingdom
and
the
world
had
nothing
more
to
offer
him
in
the
way
of
bliss
while
jo
trudged
beside
him
feeling
as
if
her
place
had
always
been
there
and
wondering
how
she
ever
could
have
chosen
any
other
lot
of
course
she
was
the
first
to
speak--intelligibly
i
mean
for
the
emotional
remarks
which
followed
her
impetuous
oh
yes
were
not
of
a
coherent
or
reportable
character
friedrich
why
didn't
you--
ah
heaven
she
gifs
me
the
name
that
no
one
speaks
since
minna
died
cried
the
professor
pausing
in
a
puddle
to
regard
her
with
grateful
delight
i
always
call
you
so
to
myself--i
forgot
but
i
won't
unless
you
like
it
like
it
it
is
more
sweet
to
me
than
i
can
tell
say
'thou,'
also
and
i
shall
say
your
language
is
almost
as
beautiful
as
mine
isn't
'thou'
a
little
sentimental
asked
jo
privately
thinking
it
a
lovely
monosyllable
sentimental
yes
thank
gott
we
germans
believe
in
sentiment
and
keep
ourselves
young
mit
it
your
english
'you'
is
so
cold
say
'thou,'
heart's
dearest
it
means
so
much
to
me
pleaded
mr
bhaer
more
like
a
romantic
student
than
a
grave
professor
well
then
why
didn't
thou
tell
me
all
this
sooner
asked
jo
bashfully
now
i
shall
haf
to
show
thee
all
my
heart
and
i
so
gladly
will
because
thou
must
take
care
of
it
hereafter
see
then
my
jo,--ah
the
dear
funny
little
name!--i
had
a
wish
to
tell
something
the
day
i
said
good-by
in
new
york
but
i
thought
the
handsome
friend
was
betrothed
to
thee
and
so
i
spoke
not
wouldst
thou
have
said
'yes,'
then
if
i
_had_
spoken
i
don't
know
i'm
afraid
not
for
i
didn't
have
any
heart
just
then
prut
that
i
do
not
believe
it
was
asleep
till
the
fairy
prince
came
through
the
wood
and
waked
it
up
ah
well
'die
erste
liebe
ist
die
beste;'
but
that
i
should
not
expect
yes
the
first
love
_is_
the
best
so
be
contented
for
i
never
had
another
teddy
was
only
a
boy
and
soon
got
over
his
little
fancy
said
jo
anxious
to
correct
the
professor's
mistake
good
then
i
shall
rest
happy
and
be
sure
that
thou
givest
me
all
i
haf
waited
so
long
i
am
grown
selfish
as
thou
wilt
find
professorin
i
like
that
cried
jo
delighted
with
her
new
name
now
tell
me
what
brought
you
at
last
just
when
i
most
wanted
you
this
and
mr
bhaer
took
a
little
worn
paper
out
of
his
waistcoat-pocket
jo
unfolded
it
and
looked
much
abashed
for
it
was
one
of
her
own
contributions
to
a
paper
that
paid
for
poetry
which
accounted
for
her
sending
it
an
occasional
attempt
how
could
that
bring
you
she
asked
wondering
what
he
meant
i
found
it
by
chance
i
knew
it
by
the
names
and
the
initials
and
in
it
there
was
one
little
verse
that
seemed
to
call
me
read
and
find
him
i
will
see
that
you
go
not
in
the
wet
jo
obeyed
and
hastily
skimmed
through
the
lines
which
she
had
christened--
in
the
garret
four
little
chests
all
in
a
row
dim
with
dust
and
worn
by
time
all
fashioned
and
filled
long
ago
by
children
now
in
their
prime
four
little
keys
hung
side
by
side
with
faded
ribbons
brave
and
gay
when
fastened
there
with
childish
pride
long
ago
on
a
rainy
day
four
little
names
one
on
each
lid
carved
out
by
a
boyish
hand
and
underneath
there
lieth
hid
histories
of
the
happy
band
once
playing
here
and
pausing
oft
to
hear
the
sweet
refrain
that
came
and
went
on
the
roof
aloft
in
the
falling
summer
rain
'meg'
on
the
first
lid
smooth
and
fair
i
look
in
with
loving
eyes
for
folded
here
with
well-known
care
a
goodly
gathering
lies
the
record
of
a
peaceful
life,--
gifts
to
gentle
child
and
girl
a
bridal
gown
lines
to
a
wife
a
tiny
shoe
a
baby
curl
no
toys
in
this
first
chest
remain
for
all
are
carried
away
in
their
old
age
to
join
again
in
another
small
meg's
play
ah
happy
mother
well
i
know
you
hear
like
a
sweet
refrain
lullabies
ever
soft
and
low
in
the
falling
summer
rain
'jo'
on
the
next
lid
scratched
and
worn
and
within
a
motley
store
of
headless
dolls
of
school-books
torn
birds
and
beasts
that
speak
no
more
spoils
brought
home
from
the
fairy
ground
only
trod
by
youthful
feet
dreams
of
a
future
never
found
memories
of
a
past
still
sweet
half-writ
poems
stories
wild
april
letters
warm
and
cold
diaries
of
a
wilful
child
hints
of
a
woman
early
old
a
woman
in
a
lonely
home
hearing
like
a
sad
refrain,--
'be
worthy
love
and
love
will
come,'
in
the
falling
summer
rain
my
beth
the
dust
is
always
swept
from
the
lid
that
bears
your
name
as
if
by
loving
eyes
that
wept
by
careful
hands
that
often
came
death
canonized
for
us
one
saint
ever
less
human
than
divine
and
still
we
lay
with
tender
plaint
relics
in
this
household
shrine.--
the
silver
bell
so
seldom
rung
the
little
cap
which
last
she
wore
the
fair
dead
catherine
that
hung
by
angels
borne
above
her
door
the
songs
she
sang
without
lament
in
her
prison-house
of
pain
forever
are
they
sweetly
blent
with
the
falling
summer
rain
upon
the
last
lid's
polished
field--
legend
now
both
fair
and
true--
a
gallant
knight
bears
on
his
shield
'amy,'
in
letters
gold
and
blue
within
lie
snoods
that
bound
her
hair
slippers
that
have
danced
their
last
faded
flowers
laid
by
with
care
fans
whose
airy
toils
are
past
gay
valentines
all
ardent
flames
trifles
that
have
borne
their
part
in
girlish
hopes
and
fears
and
shames,--
the
record
of
a
maiden
heart
now
learning
fairer
truer
spells
hearing
like
a
blithe
refrain
the
silver
sound
of
bridal
bells
in
the
falling
summer
rain
four
little
chests
all
in
a
row
dim
with
dust
and
worn
by
time
four
women
taught
by
weal
and
woe
to
love
and
labor
in
their
prime
four
sisters
parted
for
an
hour
none
lost
one
only
gone
before
made
by
love's
immortal
power
nearest
and
dearest
evermore
oh
when
these
hidden
stores
of
ours
lie
open
to
the
father's
sight
may
they
be
rich
in
golden
hours
deeds
that
show
fairer
for
the
light
lives
whose
brave
music
long
shall
ring
like
a
spirit-stirring
strain
souls
that
shall
gladly
soar
and
sing
in
the
long
sunshine
after

j
m
it's
very
bad
poetry
but
i
felt
it
when
i
wrote
it
one
day
when
i
was
very
lonely
and
had
a
good
cry
on
a
rag-bag
i
never
thought
it
would
go
where
it
could
tell
tales
said
jo
tearing
up
the
verses
the
professor
had
treasured
so
long
let
it
go
it
has
done
its
duty
and
i
will
haf
a
fresh
one
when
i
read
all
the
brown
book
in
which
she
keeps
her
little
secrets
said
mr
bhaer
with
a
smile
as
he
watched
the
fragments
fly
away
on
the
wind
yes
he
added
earnestly
i
read
that
and
i
think
to
myself
'she
has
a
sorrow
she
is
lonely
she
would
find
comfort
in
true
love
i
haf
a
heart
full
full
for
her
shall
i
not
go
and
say
'if
this
is
not
too
poor
a
thing
to
gif
for
what
i
shall
hope
to
receive
take
it
in
gott's
name?'
and
so
you
came
to
find
that
it
was
not
too
poor
but
the
one
precious
thing
i
needed
whispered
jo
i
had
no
courage
to
think
that
at
first
heavenly
kind
as
was
your
welcome
to
me
but
soon
i
began
to
hope
and
then
i
said
'i
will
haf
her
if
i
die
for
it,'
and
so
i
will
cried
mr
bhaer
with
a
defiant
nod
as
if
the
walls
of
mist
closing
round
them
were
barriers
which
he
was
to
surmount
or
valiantly
knock
down
jo
thought
that
was
splendid
and
resolved
to
be
worthy
of
her
knight
though
he
did
not
come
prancing
on
a
charger
in
gorgeous
array
what
made
you
stay
away
so
long
she
asked
presently
finding
it
so
pleasant
to
ask
confidential
questions
and
get
delightful
answers
that
she
could
not
keep
silent
it
was
not
easy
but
i
could
not
find
the
heart
to
take
you
from
that
so
happy
home
until
i
could
haf
a
prospect
of
one
to
give
you
after
much
time
perhaps
and
hard
work
how
could
i
ask
you
to
gif
up
so
much
for
a
poor
old
fellow
who
has
no
fortune
but
a
little
learning
i'm
glad
you
_are_
poor
i
couldn't
bear
a
rich
husband
said
jo
decidedly
adding
in
a
softer
tone
don't
fear
poverty
i've
known
it
long
enough
to
lose
my
dread
and
be
happy
working
for
those
i
love
and
don't
call
yourself
old,--forty
is
the
prime
of
life
i
couldn't
help
loving
you
if
you
were
seventy
the
professor
found
that
so
touching
that
he
would
have
been
glad
of
his
handkerchief
if
he
could
have
got
at
it
as
he
couldn't
jo
wiped
his
eyes
for
him
and
said
laughing
as
she
took
away
a
bundle
or
two,--
i
may
be
strong-minded
but
no
one
can
say
i'm
out
of
my
sphere
now
for
woman's
special
mission
is
supposed
to
be
drying
tears
and
bearing
burdens
i'm
to
carry
my
share
friedrich
and
help
to
earn
the
home
make
up
your
mind
to
that
or
i'll
never
go
she
added
resolutely
as
he
tried
to
reclaim
his
load
we
shall
see
haf
you
patience
to
wait
a
long
time
jo
i
must
go
away
and
do
my
work
alone
i
must
help
my
boys
first
because
even
for
you
i
may
not
break
my
word
to
minna
can
you
forgif
that
and
be
happy
while
we
hope
and
wait
yes
i
know
i
can
for
we
love
one
another
and
that
makes
all
the
rest
easy
to
bear
i
have
my
duty
also
and
my
work
i
couldn't
enjoy
myself
if
i
neglected
them
even
for
you
so
there's
no
need
of
hurry
or
impatience
you
can
do
your
part
out
west
i
can
do
mine
here
and
both
be
happy
hoping
for
the
best
and
leaving
the
future
to
be
as
god
wills
ah
thou
gifest
me
such
hope
and
courage
and
i
haf
nothing
to
gif
back
but
a
full
heart
and
these
empty
hands
cried
the
professor
quite
overcome
illustration
under
the
umbrella
jo
never
never
would
learn
to
be
proper
for
when
he
said
that
as
they
stood
upon
the
steps
she
just
put
both
hands
into
his
whispering
tenderly
not
empty
now
and
stooping
down
kissed
her
friedrich
under
the
umbrella
it
was
dreadful
but
she
would
have
done
it
if
the
flock
of
draggle-tailed
sparrows
on
the
hedge
had
been
human
beings
for
she
was
very
far
gone
indeed
and
quite
regardless
of
everything
but
her
own
happiness
though
it
came
in
such
a
very
simple
guise
that
was
the
crowning
moment
of
both
their
lives
when
turning
from
the
night
and
storm
and
loneliness
to
the
household
light
and
warmth
and
peace
waiting
to
receive
them
with
a
glad
welcome

led
her
lover
in
and

door

harvest

xlvii
harvest
time
for
a
year
jo
and
her
professor
worked
and
waited
hoped
and
loved
met
occasionally
and
wrote
such
voluminous
letters
that
the
rise
in
the
price
of
paper
was
accounted
for
laurie
said
the
second
year
began
rather
soberly
for
their
prospects
did
not
brighten
and
aunt
march
died
suddenly
but
when
their
first
sorrow
was
over,--for
they
loved
the
old
lady
in
spite
of
her
sharp
tongue,--they
found
they
had
cause
for
rejoicing
for
she
had
left
plumfield
to
jo
which
made
all
sorts
of
joyful
things
possible
it's
a
fine
old
place
and
will
bring
a
handsome
sum
for
of
course
you
intend
to
sell
it
said
laurie
as
they
were
all
talking
the
matter
over
some
weeks
later
no
i
don't
was
jo's
decided
answer
as
she
petted
the
fat
poodle
whom
she
had
adopted
out
of
respect
to
his
former
mistress
you
don't
mean
to
live
there
yes
i
do
but
my
dear
girl
it's
an
immense
house
and
will
take
a
power
of
money
to
keep
it
in
order
the
garden
and
orchard
alone
need
two
or
three
men
and
farming
isn't
in
bhaer's
line
i
take
it
he'll
try
his
hand
at
it
there
if
i
propose
it
and
you
expect
to
live
on
the
produce
of
the
place
well
that
sounds
paradisiacal
but
you'll
find
it
desperate
hard
work
the
crop
we
are
going
to
raise
is
a
profitable
one
and
jo
laughed
of
what
is
this
fine
crop
to
consist
ma'am
boys
i
want
to
open
a
school
for
little
lads,--a
good
happy
homelike
school
with
me
to
take
care
of
them
and
fritz
to
teach
them
there's
a
truly
joian
plan
for
you
isn't
that
just
like
her
cried
laurie
appealing
to
the
family
who
looked
as
much
surprised
as
he
i
like
it
said
mrs
march
decidedly
so
do
i
added
her
husband
who
welcomed
the
thought
of
a
chance
for
trying
the
socratic
method
of
education
on
modern
youth
it
will
be
an
immense
care
for
jo
said
meg
stroking
the
head
of
her
one
all-absorbing
son
jo
can
do
it
and
be
happy
in
it
it's
a
splendid
idea
tell
us
all
about
it
cried
mr
laurence
who
had
been
longing
to
lend
the
lovers
a
hand
but
knew
that
they
would
refuse
his
help
i
knew
you'd
stand
by
me
sir
amy
does
too--i
see
it
in
her
eyes
though
she
prudently
waits
to
turn
it
over
in
her
mind
before
she
speaks
now
my
dear
people
continued
jo
earnestly
just
understand
that
this
isn't
a
new
idea
of
mine
but
a
long-cherished
plan
before
my
fritz
came
i
used
to
think
how
when
i'd
made
my
fortune
and
no
one
needed
me
at
home
i'd
hire
a
big
house
and
pick
up
some
poor
forlorn
little
lads
who
hadn't
any
mothers
and
take
care
of
them
and
make
life
jolly
for
them
before
it
was
too
late
i
see
so
many
going
to
ruin
for
want
of
help
at
the
right
minute
i
love
so
to
do
anything
for
them
i
seem
to
feel
their
wants
and
sympathize
with
their
troubles
and
oh
i
should
_so_
like
to
be
a
mother
to
them
mrs
march
held
out
her
hand
to
jo
who
took
it
smiling
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
went
on
in
the
old
enthusiastic
way
which
they
had
not
seen
for
a
long
while
i
told
my
plan
to
fritz
once
and
he
said
it
was
just
what
he
would
like
and
agreed
to
try
it
when
we
got
rich
bless
his
dear
heart
he's
been
doing
it
all
his
life,--helping
poor
boys
i
mean
not
getting
rich
that
he'll
never
be
money
doesn't
stay
in
his
pocket
long
enough
to
lay
up
any
but
now
thanks
to
my
good
old
aunt
who
loved
me
better
than
i
ever
deserved
_i'm_
rich
at
least
i
feel
so
and
we
can
live
at
plumfield
perfectly
well
if
we
have
a
flourishing
school
it's
just
the
place
for
boys
the
house
is
big
and
the
furniture
strong
and
plain
there's
plenty
of
room
for
dozens
inside
and
splendid
grounds
outside
they
could
help
in
the
garden
and
orchard
such
work
is
healthy
isn't
it
sir
then
fritz
can
train
and
teach
in
his
own
way
and
father
will
help
him
i
can
feed
and
nurse
and
pet
and
scold
them
and
mother
will
be
my
stand-by
i've
always
longed
for
lots
of
boys
and
never
had
enough
now
i
can
fill
the
house
full
and
revel
in
the
little
dears
to
my
heart's
content
think
what
luxury,--plumfield
my
own
and
a
wilderness
of
boys
to
enjoy
it
with
me
as
jo
waved
her
hands
and
gave
a
sigh
of
rapture
the
family
went
off
into
a
gale
of
merriment
and
mr
laurence
laughed
till
they
thought
he'd
have
an
apoplectic
fit
i
don't
see
anything
funny
she
said
gravely
when
she
could
be
heard
nothing
could
be
more
natural
or
proper
than
for
my
professor
to
open
a
school
and
for
me
to
prefer
to
reside
on
my
own
estate
she
is
putting
on
airs
already
said
laurie
who
regarded
the
idea
in
the
light
of
a
capital
joke
but
may
i
inquire
how
you
intend
to
support
the
establishment
if
all
the
pupils
are
little
ragamuffins
i'm
afraid
your
crop
won't
be
profitable
in
a
worldly
sense
mrs
bhaer
now
don't
be
a
wet-blanket
teddy
of
course
i
shall
have
rich
pupils
also,--perhaps
begin
with
such
altogether
then
when
i've
got
a
start
i
can
take
a
ragamuffin
or
two
just
for
a
relish
rich
people's
children
often
need
care
and
comfort
as
well
as
poor
i've
seen
unfortunate
little
creatures
left
to
servants
or
backward
ones
pushed
forward
when
it's
real
cruelty
some
are
naughty
through
mismanagement
or
neglect
and
some
lose
their
mothers
besides
the
best
have
to
get
through
the
hobbledehoy
age
and
that's
the
very
time
they
need
most
patience
and
kindness
people
laugh
at
them
and
hustle
them
about
try
to
keep
them
out
of
sight
and
expect
them
to
turn
all
at
once
from
pretty
children
into
fine
young
men
they
don't
complain
much,--plucky
little
souls,--but
they
feel
it
i've
been
through
something
of
it
and
i
know
all
about
it
i've
a
special
interest
in
such
young
bears
and
like
to
show
them
that
i
see
the
warm
honest
well-meaning
boys'
hearts
in
spite
of
the
clumsy
arms
and
legs
and
the
topsy-turvy
heads
i've
had
experience
too
for
haven't
i
brought
up
one
boy
to
be
a
pride
and
honor
to
his
family
i'll
testify
that
you
tried
to
do
it
said
laurie
with
a
grateful
look
and
i've
succeeded
beyond
my
hopes
for
here
you
are
a
steady
sensible
business
man
doing
heaps
of
good
with
your
money
and
laying
up
the
blessings
of
the
poor
instead
of
dollars
but
you
are
not
merely
a
business
man
you
love
good
and
beautiful
things
enjoy
them
yourself
and
let
others
go
halves
as
you
always
did
in
the
old
times
i
_am_
proud
of
you
teddy
for
you
get
better
every
year
and
every
one
feels
it
though
you
won't
let
them
say
so
yes
and
when
i
have
my
flock
i'll
just
point
to
you
and
say
'there's
your
model
my
lads.'
poor
laurie
didn't
know
where
to
look
for
man
though
he
was
something
of
the
old
bashfulness
came
over
him
as
this
burst
of
praise
made
all
faces
turn
approvingly
upon
him
i
say
jo
that's
rather
too
much
he
began
just
in
his
old
boyish
way
you
have
all
done
more
for
me
than
i
can
ever
thank
you
for
except
by
doing
my
best
not
to
disappoint
you
you
have
rather
cast
me
off
lately
jo
but
i've
had
the
best
of
help
nevertheless
so
if
i've
got
on
at
all
you
may
thank
these
two
for
it
and
he
laid
one
hand
gently
on
his
grandfather's
white
head
the
other
on
amy's
golden
one
for
the
three
were
never
far
apart
i
do
think
that
families
are
the
most
beautiful
things
in
all
the
world
burst
out
jo
who
was
in
an
unusually
uplifted
frame
of
mind
just
then
when
i
have
one
of
my
own
i
hope
it
will
be
as
happy
as
the
three
i
know
and
love
the
best
if
john
and
my
fritz
were
only
here
it
would
be
quite
a
little
heaven
on
earth
she
added
more
quietly
and
that
night
when
she
went
to
her
room
after
a
blissful
evening
of
family
counsels
hopes
and
plans
her
heart
was
so
full
of
happiness
that
she
could
only
calm
it
by
kneeling
beside
the
empty
bed
always
near
her
own
and
thinking
tender
thoughts
of
beth
it
was
a
very
astonishing
year
altogether
for
things
seemed
to
happen
in
an
unusually
rapid
and
delightful
manner
almost
before
she
knew
where
she
was
jo
found
herself
married
and
settled
at
plumfield
then
a
family
of
six
or
seven
boys
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
and
flourished
surprisingly
poor
boys
as
well
as
rich
for
mr
laurence
was
continually
finding
some
touching
case
of
destitution
and
begging
the
bhaers
to
take
pity
on
the
child
and
he
would
gladly
pay
a
trifle
for
its
support
in
this
way
the
sly
old
gentleman
got
round
proud
jo
and
furnished
her
with
the
style
of
boy
in
which
she
most
delighted
of
course
it
was
up-hill
work
at
first
and
jo
made
queer
mistakes
but
the
wise
professor
steered
her
safely
into
calmer
waters
and
the
most
rampant
ragamuffin
was
conquered
in
the
end
how
jo
did
enjoy
her
wilderness
of
boys
and
how
poor
dear
aunt
march
would
have
lamented
had
she
been
there
to
see
the
sacred
precincts
of
prim
well-ordered
plumfield
overrun
with
toms
dicks
and
harrys
there
was
a
sort
of
poetic
justice
about
it
after
all
for
the
old
lady
had
been
the
terror
of
the
boys
for
miles
round
and
now
the
exiles
feasted
freely
on
forbidden
plums
kicked
up
the
gravel
with
profane
boots
unreproved
and
played
cricket
in
the
big
field
where
the
irritable
cow
with
a
crumpled
horn
used
to
invite
rash
youths
to
come
and
be
tossed
it
became
a
sort
of
boys'
paradise
and
laurie
suggested
that
it
should
be
called
the
bhaer-garten
as
a
compliment
to
its
master
and
appropriate
to
its
inhabitants
it
never
was
a
fashionable
school
and
the
professor
did
not
lay
up
a
fortune
but
it
_was_
just
what
jo
intended
it
to
be,--"a
happy
homelike
place
for
boys
who
needed
teaching
care
and
kindness
every
room
in
the
big
house
was
soon
full
every
little
plot
in
the
garden
soon
had
its
owner
a
regular
menagerie
appeared
in
barn
and
shed
for
pet
animals
were
allowed
and
three
times
a
day
jo
smiled
at
her
fritz
from
the
head
of
a
long
table
lined
on
either
side
with
rows
of
happy
young
faces
which
all
turned
to
her
with
affectionate
eyes
confiding
words
and
grateful
hearts
full
of
love
for
mother
bhaer
she
had
boys
enough
now
and
did
not
tire
of
them
though
they
were
not
angels
by
any
means
and
some
of
them
caused
both
professor
and
professorin
much
trouble
and
anxiety
but
her
faith
in
the
good
spot
which
exists
in
the
heart
of
the
naughtiest
sauciest
most
tantalizing
little
ragamuffin
gave
her
patience
skill
and
in
time
success
for
no
mortal
boy
could
hold
out
long
with
father
bhaer
shining
on
him
as
benevolently
as
the
sun
and
mother
bhaer
forgiving
him
seventy
times
seven
very
precious
to
jo
was
the
friendship
of
the
lads
their
penitent
sniffs
and
whispers
after
wrong-doing
their
droll
or
touching
little
confidences
their
pleasant
enthusiasms
hopes
and
plans
even
their
misfortunes
for
they
only
endeared
them
to
her
all
the
more
there
were
slow
boys
and
bashful
boys
feeble
boys
and
riotous
boys
boys
that
lisped
and
boys
that
stuttered
one
or
two
lame
ones
and
a
merry
little
quadroon
who
could
not
be
taken
in
elsewhere
but
who
was
welcome
to
the
bhaer-garten
though
some
people
predicted
that
his
admission
would
ruin
the
school
yes
jo
was
a
very
happy
woman
there
in
spite
of
hard
work
much
anxiety
and
a
perpetual
racket
she
enjoyed
it
heartily
and
found
the
applause
of
her
boys
more
satisfying
than
any
praise
of
the
world
for
now
she
told
no
stories
except
to
her
flock
of
enthusiastic
believers
and
admirers
as
the
years
went
on
two
little
lads
of
her
own
came
to
increase
her
happiness,--rob
named
for
grandpa
and
teddy
a
happy-go-lucky
baby
who
seemed
to
have
inherited
his
papa's
sunshiny
temper
as
well
as
his
mother's
lively
spirit
how
they
ever
grew
up
alive
in
that
whirlpool
of
boys
was
a
mystery
to
their
grandma
and
aunts
but
they
flourished
like
dandelions
in
spring
and
their
rough
nurses
loved
and
served
them
well
there
were
a
great
many
holidays
at
plumfield
and
one
of
the
most
delightful
was
the
yearly
apple-picking
for
then
the
marches
laurences
brookes
and
bhaers
turned
out
in
full
force
and
made
a
day
of
it
five
years
after
jo's
wedding
one
of
these
fruitful
festivals
occurred,--a
mellow
october
day
when
the
air
was
full
of
an
exhilarating
freshness
which
made
the
spirits
rise
and
the
blood
dance
healthily
in
the
veins
the
old
orchard
wore
its
holiday
attire
golden-rod
and
asters
fringed
the
mossy
walls
grasshoppers
skipped
briskly
in
the
sere
grass
and
crickets
chirped
like
fairy
pipers
at
a
feast
squirrels
were
busy
with
their
small
harvesting
birds
twittered
their
adieux
from
the
alders
in
the
lane
and
every
tree
stood
ready
to
send
down
its
shower
of
red
or
yellow
apples
at
the
first
shake
everybody
was
there
everybody
laughed
and
sang
climbed
up
and
tumbled
down
everybody
declared
that
there
never
had
been
such
a
perfect
day
or
such
a
jolly
set
to
enjoy
it
and
every
one
gave
themselves
up
to
the
simple
pleasures
of
the
hour
as
freely
as
if
there
were
no
such
things
as
care
or
sorrow
in
the
world
mr

placidly
about
quoting

and
columella
to
mr
laurence
while
enjoying--
the
gentle
apple's
winey
juice
the
professor
charged
up
and
down
the
green
aisles
like
a
stout
teutonic
knight
with
a
pole
for
a
lance
leading
on
the

sat
among
the
apple
piles
like
a
pair
of
pomonas
sorting
the
contributions
that
kept
pouring
in
while
amy
with
a
beautiful
motherly
expression
in
her
face
sketched
the
various
groups
and
watched
over
one
pale
lad
who
sat
adoring
her
with
his
little
crutch
beside
him
jo
was
in
her
element
that
day
and
rushed
about
with
her
gown
pinned
up
her
hat
anywhere

on
her
head
and
her
baby
tucked
under
her
arm

for

lad

off
on
the
back
of
another

supplied
with
sour
russets

his
indulgent
papa

labored
under
the
germanic
delusion
that
babies
could
digest
anything

pickled
cabbage
to

nails
and
their

and
rosy
dirty
and
serene

received

back

hearty
welcome

teddy

at
four
o'clock
a
lull
took
place
and
baskets
remained
empty
while
the
apple-pickers
rested
and
compared
rents
and
bruises
then
jo
and
meg
with
a
detachment
of
the
bigger
boys
set
forth
the
supper
on
the
grass
for
an
out-of-door
tea
was
always
the
crowning
joy
of
the
day
the
land
literally
flowed
with
milk
and
honey
on
such
occasions
for
the
lads
were
not
required
to
sit
at
table
but
allowed
to
partake
of
refreshment
as
they
liked,--freedom
being
the
sauce
best
beloved
by
the
boyish
soul
they
availed
themselves
of
the
rare
privilege
to
the
fullest
extent
for
some
tried
the
pleasing
experiment
of
drinking
milk
while
standing
on
their
heads
others
lent
a
charm
to
leap-frog
by
eating
pie
in
the
pauses
of
the
game
cookies
were
sown
broadcast
over
the
field
and
apple-turnovers
roosted
in
the
trees
like
a
new
style
of
bird
the
little
girls
had
a
private
tea-party
and
ted
roved
among
the
edibles
at
his
own
sweet
will
when
no
one
could
eat
any
more
the
professor
proposed
the
first
regular
toast
which
was
always
drunk
at
such
times,--"aunt
march
god
bless
her
a
toast
heartily
given
by
the
good
man
who
never
forgot
how
much
he
owed
her

drunk

to
keep
her
memory

grandma's
sixtieth
birthday
long
life
to
her
with
three
times
three
that
was
given
with
a
will
as
you
may
well
believe
and
the
cheering
once
begun
it
was
hard
to
stop
it
everybody's
health
was
proposed
from
mr
laurence
who
was
considered
their
special
patron
to
the
astonished
guinea-pig
who
had
strayed
from
its
proper
sphere
in
search
of
its
young
master
demi
as
the
oldest
grandchild
then
presented
the
queen
of
the
day
with
various
gifts
so
numerous
that
they
were
transported
to
the
festive
scene
in
a
wheelbarrow
funny
presents
some
of
them
but
what
would
have
been
defects
to
other
eyes
were
ornaments
to
grandma's,--for
the
children's
gifts
were
all
their
own
every
stitch
daisy's
patient
little
fingers
had
put
into
the
handkerchiefs
she
hemmed
was
better
than
embroidery
to
mrs
march
demi's
shoe-box
was
a
miracle
of
mechanical
skill
though
the
cover
wouldn't
shut
rob's
footstool
had
a
wiggle
in
its
uneven
legs
that
she
declared
was
very
soothing
and
no
page
of
the
costly
book
amy's
child
gave
her
was
so
fair
as
that
on
which
appeared
in
tipsy
capitals
the
words,--"to
dear
grandma
from
her
little

this
ceremony
the

mysteriously

when

thank
her

broken
down

teddy
wiped
her

from

to

echoed
the

the
little
song

the

trained
his

the
best
effect
this
was
something
altogether
new
and
it
proved
a
grand
success
for
mrs

again
when
my
greatest
wish
has
been
so
beautifully
gratified
said
mrs
bhaer
taking
teddy's
little
fist
out
of
the
milk-pitcher
in
which
he
was
rapturously
churning
and
yet
your
life
is
very
different
from
the
one
you
pictured
so
long
ago
do
you
remember
our
castles
in
the
air
asked
amy
smiling
as
she
watched
laurie
and
john
playing
cricket
with
the
boys
dear
fellows
it
does
my
heart
good
to
see
them
forget
business
and
frolic
for
a
day
answered
jo
who
now
spoke
in
a
maternal
way
of
all
mankind
yes
i
remember
but
the
life
i
wanted
then
seems
selfish
lonely
and
cold
to
me
now
i
haven't
given
up
the
hope
that
i
may
write
a
good
book
yet
but
i
can
wait
and
i'm
sure
it
will
be
all
the
better
for
such
experiences
and
illustrations
as
these
and
jo
pointed
from
the
lively
lads
in
the
distance
to
her
father
leaning
on
the
professor's
arm
as
they
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
sunshine
deep
in
one
of
the
conversations
which
both
enjoyed
so
much
and
then
to
her
mother
sitting
enthroned
among
her
daughters
with
their
children
in
her
lap
and
at
her
feet
as
if
all
found
help
and
happiness
in
the
face
which
never
could
grow
old
to
them
my
castle
was
the
most
nearly
realized
of
all
i
asked
for
splendid
things
to
be
sure
but
in
my
heart
i
knew
i
should
be
satisfied
if
i
had
a
little
home
and
john
and
some
dear
children
like
these
i've
got
them
all
thank
god
and
am
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
and
meg
laid
her
hand
on
her
tall
boy's
head
with
a
face
full
of
tender
and
devout
content
my
castle
is
very
different
from
what
i
planned
but
i
would
not
alter
it
though
like
jo
i
don't
relinquish
all
my
artistic
hopes
or
confine
myself
to
helping
others
fulfil
their
dreams
of
beauty
i've
begun
to
model
a
figure
of
baby
and
laurie
says
it
is
the
best
thing
i've
ever
done
i
think
so
myself
and
mean
to
do
it
in
marble
so
that
whatever
happens
i
may
at
least
keep
the
image
of
my
little
angel
as
amy
spoke
a
great
tear
dropped
on
the
golden
hair
of
the
sleeping
child
in
her
arms
for
her
one
well-beloved
daughter
was
a
frail
little
creature
and
the
dread
of
losing
her
was
the
shadow
over
amy's
sunshine
this
cross
was
doing
much
for
both
father
and
mother
for
one
love
and
sorrow
bound
them
closely
together
amy's
nature
was
growing
sweeter
deeper
and
more
tender
laurie
was
growing
more
serious
strong
and
firm
and
both
were
learning
that
beauty
youth
good
fortune
even
love
itself
cannot
keep
care
and
pain
loss
and
sorrow
from
the
most
blest
for--
into
each
life
some
rain
must
fall
some
days
must
be
dark
and
sad
and
dreary
she
is
growing
better
i
am
sure
of
it
my
dear
don't
despond
but
hope
and
keep
happy
said
mrs
march
as
tender-hearted
daisy
stooped
from
her
knee
to
lay
her
rosy
cheek
against
her
little
cousin's
pale
one
i
never
ought
to
while
i
have
you
to
cheer
me
up
marmee
and
laurie
to
take
more
than
half
of
every
burden
replied
amy
warmly
he
never
lets
me
see
his
anxiety
but
is
so
sweet
and
patient
with
me
so
devoted
to
beth
and
such
a
stay
and
comfort
to
me
always
that
i
can't
love
him
enough
so
in
spite
of
my
one
cross
i
can
say
with
meg
'thank
god
i'm
a
happy
woman.'
there's
no
need
for
me
to
say
it
for
every
one
can
see
that
i'm
far
happier
than
i
deserve
added
jo
glancing
from
her
good
husband
to
her
chubby
children
tumbling
on
the
grass
beside
her
fritz
is
getting
gray
and
stout
i'm
growing
as
thin
as
a
shadow
and

thirty
we
never
shall

plumfield

burn

any
night
for
that
incorrigible
tommy
bangs
_will_
smoke
sweet-fern
cigars
under
the
bed-clothes
though
he's
set
himself
afire
three
times
already
but
in
spite
of
these
unromantic
facts
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
and
never
was
so
jolly
in
my
life
excuse
the
remark
but
living
among
boys
i
can't
help
using
their
expressions
now
and
then
yes
jo
i
think
your
harvest
will
be
a
good
one
began
mrs
march
frightening
away
a
big
black
cricket
that
was
staring
teddy
out
of
countenance
not
half
so
good
as
yours
mother
here
it
is
and
we
never
can
thank
you
enough
for
the
patient
sowing
and
reaping
you
have
done
cried
jo
with
the
loving
impetuosity
which
she
never
could
outgrow
i
hope
there
will
be
more
wheat
and
fewer
tares
every
year
said
amy
softly
a
large
sheaf
but
i
know
there's
room
in
your
heart
for
it
marmee
dear
added
meg's
tender
voice
touched
to
the
heart
mrs
march
could
only
stretch
out
her
arms
as
if
to
gather
children
and
grandchildren
to
herself
and
say
with
face
and
voice
full
of
motherly
love
gratitude
and
humility,--

In Assignment 1, we are required to parallelise a string pattern matching algorithm using either POSIX or OpenMP libraries. We are also required to create a job script that is to be submitted onto a High Performance Computing (HPC) platform. 

In Assignment 2, we are required to create a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using the OpenMPI library that mimics the communication between Electric Vehicle charging stations.

In Assignment 3, we are required to carry out a literature review on state-of-the-art papers in the field of parallel computing and present our findings via a recording.

Assignment 1 is related to the implementation and application of counting sort and radix sort. Given a list of match results, we are to provide an algorithm that returns a list of findings including the top 10 matches with the highest score, with the team name sorted lexicographically, as well as a list of matches with the same score, if not the closest, as provided via input.

Assignment 2 is related to Dijkstra's algorithm and dynamic programming. We are required to implement and apply Dijkstra's algorithm on the first question, and solve a dynamic programming question for the next.

Assignment 3 is related to Flow Networks and Suffix Tries. We are to implement and apply the Ford Fulkerson's algorithm to solve a flow network problem, as well as implement an algorithm to build a Suffix Trie from two input strings that supports the query of the longest common substring.

Several notable algorithms are also implemented for this unit, such as binary search, the Dutch National Flag algorithm, QuickSort, QuickSelect, Dijkstra's algorithm, Counting Sort and Radix Sort.
